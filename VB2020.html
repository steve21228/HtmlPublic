If employee &quot;A&quot; use the data manager and employee &quot;B&quot; do the same before employee &quot;A&quot; has sent the changes, then employee &quot;B&quot; will lost all changes in the data manager. I think in this case there should shown a conflict dialog (like for symbols).<br/>

The user&#39;s main file AND 2 out of the 3 perpetual backup files have twice become corrupted now. Opening the Vectorworks file every time raises the error, &quot;Unexpected end of file encountered during file read operation. (Failure on attempt to read file)&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the setup. It&#39;s a little suspect but things have been going fine until recently: <br/>
 * .vwx file kept in Vectorworks Cloud Services folder<br/>
 * Backups are put in the macOS iCloud folder<br/>
 * Autosave was set to &#39;every 3 minutes,&#39; keep 3 recent backups. <br/>
 * This is so the boss can access files as-required (not very often and they _usually_ communicate with each other), but License Session History indicates there were no concurrent usage attempts at the time. Definitely not this second occasion. <br/>
<br/>
The first time this happened (Wednesday 25th) the user (Rachael) was placing a texture bed when Vectorworks froze. Rachael force quit Vectorworks before enough time would have lapsed for Vectorworks to have made even one backup file, but with today&#39;s occasion nothing unexpected occurred. Rachael writes: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The new file has done what the old one has. After i spent most of the morning fixing it. It didnt crash or anything i saved it as normal and have just reopened it. The two most recently backup also had the corruption but the third was fine. I have resaved the third one and shut all the other files. The problem happened between 9:41am and 10:02am (between 2nd and 3rd last saves)&quot; <br/>

<br/>
In this file, I had a 3 D view in open GL.<br/>
<br/>
I panned the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
VW crashed.<br/>
<br/>
See attached crash report and test file.<br/>
<br/>
In 3D view tessellation took a long time. One object did not render. <br/>
<br/>
I copied this object (the selected brick wall) to force it to render. Then I panned and VW crashed.

We have had reasonable success when trying to import the only the 3D model file as native objects ( just a few unclipped walls -filed in a separate bug), but when trying to import using the 2D and 3D option, the import time is now at 3 hours and it still hasn&#39;t completed. <br/>

Hi team, we have had reports of multiple crashes for OMI, one of our big BIM customers. I have looked at the analytics reports and the user looks to have experienced 8 crashes over the past 4 working days all attributed to the same bug, using 2020 SP4.  Serial DAE7E3<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>
 Martyn

Hi tech support,<br/>
<br/>
This client has been experiencing some crashes lately. Joseph suggested to take it to Jira.<br/>
<br/>
The client started in VW25.2.2 and collected some crash reports. Yesterday, he called us to report another crash. I collected his user log and the file he was working on at the time. I suggested he would upgrade to SP3 and he did.<br/>
 Yesterday afternoon he called again, saying his VW had crashed again. He had saved another crash report and I copied both the crash report and his updated user log.<br/>
 You can find all the files attached.<br/>
<br/>
Time stamps of some of the recent crashes:<br/>
 04/21/2020 11:03:58<br/>
 04/21/2020 14:52:28<br/>
 04/22/2020 07:16:51 &gt; should be this file<br/>
 04/22/2020 12:40:54 &gt; a different file in which he had only just imported a DWG and zoomed out<br/>
<br/>
Most of his files are based on geolocation though. The user centre and internal VW centre match but his drawing is somewhere far away from that.<br/>
 His computer matches all the requirements for VW2020 high end-use.<br/>
 He uses a Landmark version while his coworkers use a Fundamentals (all localized NL versions). They have had no problems yet.<br/>
 ​<br/>
 Do you see a pattern or anything that might cause the crashes?<br/>

Just in case anyone cares, it is my general experience that the more detailed and developed a drawing set gets, the slower and more crash-prone VW&#39;s becomes. I am so used to it it is sad. Always seems to happen when I am actually trying to work quickly and actually get something finished. Lots of cursing (ask my wife!). No software should crash this much. Ever. Please try to fix.

I have a customer that is having constant crashing with Vectorworks. Unfortunately, I have failed to fix the issues.<br/>
<br/>
The files are not big and too complex to be causing crashing<br/>
<br/>
I have tried;<br/>
<br/>
Reset user folder<br/>
<br/>
Repair<br/>
<br/>
Changing Navigation graphics<br/>
<br/>
Service pack<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The crashing is going to analytics:<br/>

<br/>
I have attached one of the customers files and the computer profile.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apologies for going straight to QRT, the customer is not able to do work efficiently.

I also tried this in normal .vwx file and it didn&#39;t crash.

&quot;Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I honestly haven&#39;t had any .emf file to import in years. There are no known issues that I am aware of. I tried this file and it crashes for me, too. Can you please submit this as a bug on JIRA so engineering can determine if the problem is with this particular file or with Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
!Machine Specs.png|width=575,height=347!<br/>

All the iMacs are experiencing this issue but only in Vw 2021. Note they are not using VSC for anything.<br/>

Initially this appears:<br/>
<br/>
!First Message.png|width=424,height=396!<br/>

then this:<br/>

and finally this message:<br/>

at which point Vw crashes. This happens multiple times a day and apparently quite randomly. I repeat, it does not happen in Vw 2020.<br/>
<br/>
I have had them uninstall and reinstall Vw including removing the user folder and deleting the VCS app. The only thing that will stop the crashing is if they remember to quit VCS immediately after launching Vw.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

<br/>
This is a report from our user via our tech support.<br/>
 Ever since upgrading to Vectorworks 2020, it seems to crash irregularly on the user&#39;s environment.<br/>
 (He used Vectorworks 2019 before.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not by particular steps or an operation, it seems to happen suddenly.<br/>
 Neither, it doesn&#39;t seem to happen on a particular file.<br/>
<br/>
I attached some crash log files and a file that the user has experienced the crash.<br/>
 Could you look into about this problem?<br/>
 We are grateful if the cause of it shows down.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When updating the Elevation of the Fireplace, Vectorworks seems to go through a series of icons flashing, mostly in the attributes palette as you select and deselect the rendered viewport.<br/>
<br/>
The files seems to be constructed from a poor workflow, but I am not 100% sure if this is the root cause.  Looks like only a few layers are set up to be at elevation with the site, where as everything else has a 0 elevation but is offset in the Z axis.<br/>
<br/>
I have included a video of my computer showing the weird anomaly after the viewport is rendered.

<br/>
According to the help instructions, time limit for generating animations from Vectorworks in the Cloud Services is 48 hours, but our clients gets a time-out error message after 24 hours.<br/>
She would like to get the results similar to those presented here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofnfm8WSGRE&amp;t=3s<br/>
<br/>
She can generate animations within 24-hours with settings illustrated in the screenshots, but the results are not satisfactory. Unfortunately, better rendering options cause time-out error.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t she have 48 hour time limit for generating animations?<br/>
Which settings should she use to obtain high quality movie and manage to generate it within time limit in the Cloud Services?<br/>
Please let me know if you need translation of any settings presented in the pictures.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Really stumped on this crash, the customer is just simply creating a class and then experiences crashing. Sometimes this doesn&#39;t happen instantly, but when i duplicate and try edit the class there is a crash. This doesn&#39;t happen on just one file, this happens on every file. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround by going into the organisation pallet and creating classes etc this way. I have attached everything I can grab from the computer. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have tried a reset of user folder, repair, uninstall/re install, changed navigation graphics, set up graphics card, asked to re boot computer but still nothing. i even had the customer close everything and then just have Vectorworks open. She said this only started happening before xmas. They should be on latest service pack as we uninstalled/re installed.<br/>
<br/>
They have been having real issues with there computer speed as download and uninstall took some time.

<br/>
We have a client where one of their viewports won&#39;t render within Vectorworks 2019. In 2020 this is rendering ok. They have reverted the file back to 2019 due to other issues within 2020 so I would like to see if they can render in 2019. <br/>
<br/>
Please find below some of the background email info: <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
_Good morning,_<br/>
<br/>
_We are having problems with one section only. On sheet B12 (the file should open on this page) the South Elevation will not update and crashes every time. All other sections on this sheet and other sheets work fine. I have copied properties across viewports, redrawn the section line, changed the layer settings piece by piece but can&#39;t seem to find out what is wrong here. Could you please have a look for me._<br/>
<br/>
_Yes please send it to whoever you need to fix this._<br/>
<br/>
_I have a feeling it was something generated from using VW2020 then going back to VW2019. We started the project in 2019 and then worked in 2020 after SP2, then when there were still problems we saved this as a 2019 file again and resumed work in VW2019._<br/>
<br/>
_Thank you for looking into this further._<br/>
<br/>
We have tried everything possible in the office in the tech team and still can&#39;t get the viewport to render, Vectorworks just hangs. __ <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you could take a look that would be awesome! __ <br/>
<br/>
Please find the file uploaded. __ <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen __ <br/>

We are currently working on a server, with the two IFC files in the same folder as the project file on that server. One IFC file was referenced BEFORE the project file was created, and one was not. The second one was referenced by a user in her working file. Layer referencing has been used, and the reference file locations are set to relative to the original file. When trying to update the first reference using a working file, there have been several issues, including layers of the IFC file not being recognized because their names have changed so the new layers are simply not being referenced. We were forced to delete and re-reference the new file instead of trying to update. After recreating this reference and creating the new reference for the second IFC file, all changes were committed. When another user refreshed his working file, the new and existing references were listed as up to date, but the existing reference did not show any changes to the file and the layers of the new reference were not showing up at all in the layer list in the Organization palette.

I have created a new file importing his styles in and when all landscape areas are dropped into the design layer, not all of them will report.  I even made sure all landscape areas have unique names.<br/>
<br/>
If I delete all the landscape areas and then drop only one into the design layer and recalculate the worksheet, it will report.<br/>
<br/>
Delete that landscape area, recalculate worksheet so no areas are calculated, then drop a different area into the design layer and the worksheet will now recalculate that area.<br/>
<br/>
I am unsure if this is WAD.  Editing, duplicating any areas in the design layer will not update the worksheet with new duplicated areas.<br/>

The Tool &quot;Geolocate&quot; can be used to move the Vectorworks Origin. For existing documents this is very dangerous, because all the existing viewports are getting empty. <br/>

The customer noticed that changing a fill color of a wall in the attributes can make the wall appear. However, if he reverses sides of some parallel walls connected with the round wall, it can disappear again.<br/>
I have removed all other objects, isolated the wall and made it unstyled. Now it seems that changing the fill color does not help. It becomes visible when I reverse sides or change the top and/or bottom boundaries.<br/>
Apart from that I observed that any action or operation on the wall are quite slow.<br/>
<br/>
I attaché the original file from our customer, the video from him and the isolated wall in a separate .vwx file.

<br/>
I marked the Customer Importance as critical because the cases described here are extremely common cases.<br/>
<br/>
*See the attached video at the 19 second mark:*<br/>
 I have two roof faces with a rectangle clipped from the edge of them.  This effectively changes the boundary poly of the roof face.<br/>
 It doesn&#39;t seem possible to join more than on edge between them.<br/>
 Note:  this may be a technical limitation, but it&#39;s a very common need.<br/>
<br/>
*See the attached video at the 33 second mark:*<br/>
 Notice the 3D geometry of the roof face (joined in the previous step) is different than the 2D and is almost completely missing.<br/>
<br/>
*See the attached video at the 53 second mark:*<br/>
 Here we have two rectangular shaped roof face that join properly using the Connect Combine tool&#39;s Miter mode.  If I clip a 2D object from a roof face, the miter joins are lost with no way to join both of them back.<br/>

<br/>
In this case I opened the file and created a viewport in 3D view then edited the Annotations. After Exiting the annotations, and updating the viewport, the slabs became un-bounded to the walls on both stories. <br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem [not always reproducible]<br/>
<br/>
-Open test file <br/>
<br/>
-Go to the sheet layer &quot;A2.2 - Elevations&quot; and edit the Detail viewport annotations<br/>
<br/>
-Draw a space object (or a structural member or a wall). Then exit Viewport Annotations.<br/>
<br/>
-Go back to design layer &#39;1 - Floor layout&#39; and create a viewport in 3D view on &quot;A2.2 - Elevations&quot; sheet layer<br/>
<br/>
-Render viewport in Hidden line and make sure to Update (this is what will show the problem)<br/>
<br/>
-The slabs become unbounded from the walls

<br/>
Hello (and Happy New Year!),<br/>
In the enclosed file editing the Landscape Areas on the &#39;Soft Landscapes&#39; layer with the Reshape tool is very tedious and often crashes Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
The Site Model is on it&#39;s own layer. If that layer is made invisible then editing the Landscape Area works fast as expected - please see enclosed movie.<br/>
<br/>
Once thing I have done is rename the Soft landscapes layer, update the Site Model then rename the Soft landscapes layer back to the original name and re-update the Site model. This seems also to work with the Landscape Areas for both the user and myself. However I am since unable to repeat it to get it to work. The only workaround is to make the Site Model layer invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

                Curtain Wall window has incorrect geometry at corner posts (Brake Metal)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I am using a Curtain Wall to model a steel post-and-beam screened porch; vertical and horizontal members are 3&quot;x3&quot;. The insect screens are larger than the openings by an inch all around, and surface-mounted with self-tapping screws. I created a Window Style for the screens, and made them &quot;Curtain Wall Windows&quot; as part of the style, such that they would automatically accommodate the openings regardless of post spacing. So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
In order for the corner posts to appear correctly, I defined the Start and End Boundary Frames as Brake Metal with a very small Width (0.1&quot;, since 0&quot; is not an allowed value).<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file I have two such Curtain Walls meeting at a 90° corner; see Saved View 1. In this view, the two Windows nearest the corner in the left-hand wall are Curtain Wall Windows in the &quot;alum screen&quot; style. Note that the corner post models incorrectly, as both the upper and lower units are too wide and reduce their respective &quot;corner post&quot; width by half the frame depth, in this case 1 1/2&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The Right-hand wall&#39;s two closest units (in green) have been converted to Unstyled and changed from Curtain Wall Windows to &quot;normal&quot; windows. Their widths have been manually adjusted so that the corner post (Start/End Boundary frame) models correctly as a 3&quot;x3&quot; &quot;post&quot;. For a clearer view of the issue, look at Saved Views 2 (inside corner) and 3 (close-up with windows turned off).<br/>
<br/>
A Curtain Wall Window should size itself to the widest dimension of a Brake Metal Start/End Boundary frame; I cannot see the logic of their not doing so.

On the Interiors layer, you will see a screening room. There are double doors on one wall. While trying to edit the door, the follow is now happening.<br/>
The door is visible, but not selectable.<br/>
If I move or nudge the wall, the door disappears.<br/>
If I switch to a 3D openGL view, no geometry is visible on that layer.<br/>
OpenGL is working fine on the other layers.<br/>
I think this also happened with another door I was tweaking. I moved the door, and then tried to undo the move, but the door stayed where it was.<br/>
I have restarted VW and also my PC and still having these issues.

<br/>
The door tags within the unit plans change to a microscopic size.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, the door and wall and window tags are drawn correct relative to the layer scale at which they are drawn. For an unknown reason, when viewed from a sheet layer view port the scale of the tags becomes very small. They should remain a consistent size and not rescale.<br/>

<br/>
The symbol &quot;D-Rand Recht West&quot; was edited from the Resource Manager and the edit involved<br/>
 * pasting in the symbol&#39;s 3D component a 2D geometry to be used as shape for an extrude<br/>
 * create the extrude in top view, by cmd + E and entering a value of 1m<br/>
 * setting the view to a custom 3D view using the flyover while in wireframe<br/>
 * selecting the push and pull tool and choosing the face edit mode<br/>
 * refining thus the upper face of my extrude as needed, snapping to the rest of the 3D symbol comps<br/>
 * right-clicking on the new extrude and some existing geometry &gt; solid subtraction<br/>
<br/>
Upon exiting the symbol definition, most 3D geometry in the design layer &quot;LE58a-06-OG&quot; was gone. Survived: a few curtain walls, a few extrudes. I lost the slab and all elements involved in slab holes, such as a Flat Roof Skylight and various HVAC elements.<br/>
<br/>
Attached<br/>
 * a backup file &quot;LE58a-Proj-backup&quot; which must have generated just after this event. Please go to the design layer &quot;LE58a-06-OG&quot; and compare with <br/>
 * file &quot;LE58a-Proj&quot; which is correctly displaying the items<br/>

Use the attached Vectorworks file _TestFile 3_3 v2021b210.vwx_.  The extruded square on the left has a Vision Video Source attached to it (Spotlight&gt;Visualization&gt;Select Vision Video Source).  When this file is exported to MVR and opened in Vision, the video is not present.  <br/>

I tested the Acceptance Test MVR file from build 554670 in Vision and the video is present, so this is not an issue with Vision.  Included the MVR that has the video source from build 554670, the MVR without the video source from build 556793, the ESC file from Build 556793 just to compare.

<br/>
If a part is chosen the bridle tool uses this as the designed length, when in reality the user wants this to be the required leg length.<br/>
<br/>
for example a 3m bridle part is chosen, the real world rigger will understand this to mean that total designed length needed for the bridle leg will be 3m + the effective basket length<br/>
<br/>
When in reality the bridle tool is using the part length directly as the designed length without accounting for the effective basket length. Which results in the default leg parts always being far longer than the calculated required length of the parts for the leg.<br/>
<br/>
Effectively this makes the option unusable, as the bridle geometry created will bear no relationship to the actual bridle on site if the rigger uses the default parts list to build it<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
to verify this (change the number of house points for other bridle types)<br/>
<br/>
in the bridle preference select the bridle part as the default and select an appropriate bridle part from the drop<br/>
<br/>
insert a truss or pipe<br/>
<br/>
add 2  house points configured with a basket<br/>
<br/>
insert a bridle using the tools<br/>
<br/>
open the bridle configuration dialogue <br/>
<br/>
look at the bridle geometry on the left hand side of the dialogue<br/>
<br/>
the designed length will display the same length as the bridle part chosen in the bridle preferences<br/>
<br/>
the required leg length will be displayed (designed length-effective basket length)<br/>
<br/>
now look at the leg parts pane<br/>
<br/>
in the selected material the leg will use the chosen part from the bridle preferences + a shackle, which is what the user wants,<br/>
<br/>
but because the chosen part has also been used as the designed length, the total length of the selected bridle parts is longer than required leg length and results in a parts list that cannot be used.<br/>
<br/>
If the user has assigned basket dimensions to the house points the bridle is connected to this has to be taken into account when using this insertion preference<br/>

-Go to the &quot;ATECH SAS Amphor Flower Pot&quot; object and download<br/>
<br/>
Note that the download fails.<br/>
<br/>
If I download the object&#39;s VWX file from the BIMObject site it works fine (attached), so this seems to be a VW download problem.<br/>
<br/>
Other, simpler BIMObjects download without a problem, but this happened on the first object I tried so I assume there are more that fail.<br/>

{color:#FF0000}_I have encountered problems. I worked with a file yesterday that I have two ifc files added as references._{color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000}_Today when I open the same file it is so striped and the two references are not visible. I have tried to update the references but nothing happens._{color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000}_Tried to delete the two references and then the file will no longer be striped. But when I re-enter the references, they do not want to end up in the right place._{color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000}_Sends with the file and the two ifc files._{color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000} __ {color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000}_If I now want to start over again, I wonder how I should go about loading the references in the right place?_{color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000} __ {color}<br/>
{color:#FF0000}_Have tested hardscape a bit and seen a thing that is a bit strange. If I have my hardscape at Align and then Send to surface and if I then go into the hardscap and edit surface modifiers and put out a new height of ex +21.00, it plus that height of 21 m instead of folding at +21.00. Sends with a print screen on it with. Is there any setting I need to make for it?_{color}<br/>

I get a strange debug message (see screenshots warn1-8) and I even think it crashes sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
After that, I get another warning (see &quot;warning_after_crash&quot;). It seems that empty resource lists are not handled correctly.<br/>
<br/>
This is rather annoying and looks potentially dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Tested in debug version in mainline (VW 2022, Mac), but I remember having the same issues before.<br/>

The plug-in I used for testing is under development so I can&#39;t upload the project.<br/>

In my test file has it two section viewports, one on a design layer and the other on al sheet layer. The viewport shows a wall with a window (Window from Computerworks). On the Wall and in the Window I placed a text, but I can only see the text in the section viewports on the sheet layer. The design layer shows me only the bounding box.<br/>

                KLS: Export DWG with tile filling in wall components poor
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Customer wants to export his drawing (in fact its design layer 000_Grundriss_EG) to dwg format, then the tiles inside the wall components do have a poor representation. See screenshot &quot;Representation in AC&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Me personally would never use tiles for export dwg, especially not inside a wall component. But Vectorworks provide tiles (even as filling for wall components) and in export dwg dialog window there&#39;s an option &quot;Export tile fills&quot;. So somehow tiles should be support in dwg export.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what to tell the customer? Ist there a workaround other than using hatches or deselect that option &quot;Export tile fills&quot; instead? Is it a bug or more s.th. a limitation - anyway is it solved someday? Or is it a malfunction of AutoCAD?

This File is from a bigger Customer and we are running an enhances Support project for them because they talked about switching (We think they would not but we try to care as good as we can at this situation) the software because of multiply reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Also Attached am Movie File.<br/>

I reduced the File of the Project but it is still too big to Attach directly. Here is a Link:<br/>
https://cloud.vectorworks.net/links/11ead0df916b8ac286bf0ec875876b2f/<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Structure of the Layout is as following<br/>
1. Layout 5_N1.G-14_050 on File 1602_1 Teilplan GR_BN.vwx<br/>
2. Visible Layer is BN.G-14 4.OG<br/>
3. On this layer (BN.G-14 4.OG) there is a referenced Viewport From the Document 1602_1 Teilplan GR_N1.vwx. The Visible Layer is &quot;OG-4 Fertigboden&quot;<br/>
<br/>
4. On this Document &quot;1602_1 TeilplanGR N1&quot; on the Layer &quot;OG-4 Fertigboden&quot; again, there are Document linked Viewports which shows the Layouer &quot;AB OG3-5-Fertigboden&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We told customer there are too many nested Viewports anyway (because the use Viewports for Instancing Apartment Types etc.) But anyway also the Layouer&quot;OG4-Fertigboden nur Text&quot; is shown wrong and this layer do not contain viewports.<br/>

<br/>
I have selected and zoomed to the problem element, which you can see in both 2D and 3D. <br/>
<br/>
I have been working in Top/Plan view and receiving Site Modifier Conflicts where this hardscape meetings the larger piece of paving. I carefully moved the grade objects on the surface of the larger hardscape to ensure they are not overlapping the smaller piece. I also reshaped the smaller piece to leave quite a large gap - so that this piece is definitely not overlapping the larger piece. And still, I get the conflict. <br/>
Looking at it in 3D, you can see why. The 3D element of this smaller hardscape IS overlapping the other one, so there IS a modifier conflict.<br/>
<br/>
I have not had time to create other test files, but wanted to get this reported as soon as possible. Clearly it&#39;s critical that the 2D should match the 3D.<br/>
<br/>
What is causing this? Could it be anything to do with the georeferencing in the file?<br/>
<br/>
Or the curve on the larger hardscape? Let me know what else you need from me to test this and narrow it down.

                Wall Component offset and Recess cause corrupt Wall to fail at IFC export

You’ll see in the IFC and vwx file 3 Walls - one with recess and no component offset which is fine, one with no recess and component offset which is fine and one with both which fails in a strange way that some Wall components get detached from the Wall as separate objects and are no longer cut by Windows. <br/>
<br/>
The Wall is corrupt somehow, when I copy it into a blank file, the problem persists. If I create a new Wall from scratch using the same Style and insert same Window Style then create the recess, it exports correctly. Nothing I tried to reset this Wall worked, including running a wall reset script provided by Bruce Ferguson on an earlier similar issue.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any idea what might have caused this or how it might be resolved without rebuilding the model completely from scratch, as the customer won&#39;t like that suggestion.<br/>

 --------------------------<br/>
 Steps:<br/>
 1)Select &quot;Plant Tool&quot; and put it on the screen.<br/>
 Set &quot;Right Isometric&quot; view<br/>
 2)Click &quot;Edit Plant Style...&quot; of OIP<br/>
 3)Click &quot;Create from Image...&quot; of Visualization pane.<br/>
 4)Change the Image, and click &quot;OK&quot; of Create From Image dialog.<br/>
 5)Click &quot;OK&quot; of Plant Style dialog.<br/>
 6)The view changes from &quot;Right Isometric&quot; to &quot;Front&quot; and is deselected.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the selected image may not be recorded in the &quot;Create from Image&quot; dialog.<br/>
 (Motion is not constant)<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample12250.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie12250.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There is a discrepancy between the Mode Bar and the Menu.<br/>
 Refer to &quot;check_view.mov&quot;, &quot;check_view.vwx&quot;.<br/>
 When I zoom in and out with the mouse, the view returns &quot;Right Isometric&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 *When Standard View is &quot;Top/Plan&quot; view, the selected image is displayed for a moment.<br/>
 *In v2017, v2018, the view does not change, but the selection is deselected.<br/>
 *In Windows, the image may not be reflected on the screen. (Motion is not constant)<br/>
 Refer to &quot;Win_Disappear.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Add*<br/>
 The user said that the meaning of Note in &quot;Create From Image&quot; dialog is difficult to understand.<br/>
<br/>
He said that<br/>
 &quot;I don&#39;t understand the meaning of the Note, &quot;determine the size of the created image prop inside the plant 3D geometry&quot;.<br/>
 Are these values a note to write down the original size? Or does the value here affect anything or anywhere?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even if I change the value here, the placed shape will reflect the size specified in the placement options. (As written in Note)<br/>
<br/>
Does changing the value here have any affect other than &quot;Edit Current Graphics&quot;? Can I see the change in the value somewhere?<br/>
<br/>

                DWG export not exporting geometry located in Referenced Viewports
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi There, <br/>
<br/>
We have an issue being raised from one of our biggest Vectorworks users here in the UK. Assael. <br/>
<br/>
They are experiencing issues when trying to export a sheet file from a current project they are working on to DWG. <br/>
<br/>
The issue is geometry isn&#39;t being exported, the geometry originates through a viewport reference from another file. The working process they use is:<br/>
<br/>
Resource File &gt; Working File &gt; Sheet File &gt; Publish/Export from the sheet file. <br/>
<br/>
The main geometry that&#39;s not coming through is the Doors, Windows, Balcony. <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line, these are getting lost through the referencing process to the sheet file. We can&#39;t quite figure out what is going on here. We believe it might be to do with classes not being exported and maybe class overrides on viewports.<br/>
<br/>
The only way they have exported the correct information on the DWG is by ticking the Export Design layer viewports as separate files, this isn&#39;t an ideal solution.<br/>
<br/>
Please find attached the file in question and the relevant references. Also a screenshot of their referencing process and also the DWG export options. These are in 2020 format but we do have a link to the original 2017 files if needed.<br/>
<br/>
We have been able to replicate this issue within Vectorworks 2017 which is the version this project is within, but also within Vectorworks 2019 and 2020 also. <br/>
<br/>
The Sheet file is: A2494 2100 Primary Setting Out<br/>
<br/>
Sheet layer I have been testing with: CST-AA-BLA-01-DR-A-2101<br/>
<br/>
I hope i have supplied everything that&#39;s needed,<br/>
<br/>
Any help with this would be much appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks <br/>
<br/>
Helen, Luka, and Adam.<br/>

I have successfully exported similar lighting instruments.<br/>

I have tried to export IFC instead but it also hangs. I guess theres some beastie in there somewhere.

<br/>
A customer just asked this on the forum, so I looked into it with the attached file:<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/74356-question-re-surface-hatches-on-hardscapes/]<br/>
<br/>
I have applied a Renderworks texture which contains a surface hatch to two hardscapes. One is a Slab and the other is an Aligned Slab. The Aligned Slab does not display the surface hatch in a hidden line view.<br/>
<br/>
So, I tried various different types of 3D geometry, including Extrude, NURBS, 3D Polys, Mesh and Subdivision. All of these types DO display the surface hatch - even the Subdivision, which doesn&#39;t display the texture.<br/>
I am guessing that the aligned slab is actually a mesh under the covers. Is there any way it can display the surface hatch?<br/>
If you look at the forum post, the customer has included an image which shows why this is important.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

                ODBC: Connection fails from Vectorworks via CData to Airtable
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello<br/>
<br/>
I have a customer who wants to connect Vectorworks to Airtable, via ODBC. My first thought was that this can&#39;t be done. But there is a driver for Mac, made by CData, specifically for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Airtable is a cloud-based database system. I&#39;ve set up a trial account, which you are welcome to use:<br/>
[https://airtable.com/]<br/>
<br/>
[tslatter@vectorworks.net|mailto:tslatter@vectorworks.net]<br/>
<br/>
gaut6vat.HER7stot<br/>
<br/>
APIkey: keyYUwtoCw5HraV1P<br/>
<br/>
BaseID: appt77jzUh9mwIUds<br/>
<br/>
Tablenames: Furniture<br/>
<br/>
Within Airtable, I have created one of the example databases called Product Catalog, which has a table called Furniture. I thought this would be a good test to connect to some furniture symbols in Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
Now for the driver. It&#39;s not free, but you can get a trial licence. The driver is specifically for Airtable, and I have been able to successfully install it, and set up a user DSN, which tells me it has been successful. The key information I needed was the API for my Airtable account, an ID for the database, and the table name, which I have configured as in the attached screenshots, using the following instructions:<br/>
[http://cdn.cdata.com/help/JAF/odbc/pg_connectionodbcmac.htm]<br/>
<br/>
When I test the connection within the ODBC manager, I am told that the connection is good and that I can use it.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I go to Vectorworks and use the Tools &gt; Database &gt; Manage Databases command. I am able to see the DSN, so I select it and add my Airtable login credentials. The connection fails. <br/>
<br/>
When I attempt to refresh the connection, Vectorworks hangs.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a Spindump and Sample Process of the Vectorworks process when this happens in the hope that it might be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what is going wrong here? User error on my part? <br/>
<br/>
I would love to get this going, as the Airtable product looks shiny and modern, and it&#39;s unusual to see a modern updated OBDC driver for Mac like the one from CData.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice gratefully received.

<br/>
Create 2 rectangles, convert them to hardscape, setting for hardscape = aligned, not interpolated, thickness 30cm. Click on the upper rectangle, use &quot;Edit Surface Modifiers&quot;, create at each side one grade, use the red figures for grades. Check always the figures in the object info because sometimes the values of point 1 and point 2 have changed while closing the dialog box with &quot;OK&quot;. Do the same with the lower rectangle in the file. Once you are ready &quot;Exit Surface Modifier&quot; change to a 3D ISO view and realign hardscapes. Look at the upper hardscape. The grades on the left and right side have changed. I did exactly the same with the hardscape right to the first ones. I always got a strange result. If I&#39;m thinking wrong how to use the tool, please correct my approach. If I&#39;m right the tool has no practical use for planning purposes.<br/>

The background rendering of the viewport is set to OpenGL and the foreground rendering is set to Hidden Line.

This should not happen as the viewport rendering is based on the viewport settings, not the current model state.<br/>

Looks like Hardscape OIP is missing its name so Data tag fails to show. However Hardscape tag shows the name fine.

<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a movie and test file that show this in SP3 build 527568 compared to build 528138. The file was created in VW 2018 and contains a Hardscape with a by-class texture applied in the Hardscape Settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in each build and go to the Draw 3D tab of the Hardscape Settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
In the older build, note that the Main Texture is set &quot;By Class&quot;, which matches the 2018 setup.<br/>
<br/>
In the newer build, note that the Main Texture has changed to a directly-applied texture.<br/>
<br/>
If you open the file in VW 2019, save it, then open it in 2020 the problem doesn&#39;t happen, so this only seems to occur with older-version Hardscapes.

The test .vwx has a 3D building. Export as DWG and import back to Vectorworks. As result we can see some solids and slab located out of place, plus some solids are not composed of a group of 3D Polygons instead of a simple solid as before.<br/>

Is it possible to see what is causing this? I remember in the past to have reported something similar, but it was eventually fixed. I am now unsure the year, versions 2018 or 2019 it was.<br/>

1. Have Best Performance active, to see all 2D Symbols.<br/>
2. Try to select the ones shown in the video<br/>

<br/>
When we have a symbol (like a shower tub for the sanitary area) and want to attach IFC data to it, there are two ways that are available to our customers:<br/>
1. through the resource manager or <br/>
2. through the data manager<br/>
<br/>
open attached file<br/>
<br/>
1 - Resource Manager<br/>
a) right-click a symbol in the resource manager and select „IFC Data…“<br/>
b) type in „terminal“ and select „IfcSanitaryTerminalType“ &gt; OK<br/>
c) click OK —&gt; Error message: „The following field is mandatory and not set: PredefinedType“<br/>
d) As Enum value for selected property select „Shower“ &gt; OK<br/>
—&gt; message: The „IFC Data“ command will attach IFC data to all existing and future instances of a symbol. &gt; OK<br/>
<br/>
After inserting the symbol it has the IFC data attached as expected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2 - Data Manager<br/>
a) Open Tools &gt; Data Manager…<br/>
b) on the left side (objects) select the symbol definition<br/>
c) click „Add Data Set…“ <br/>
d) type in „terminal“ and select „IfcSanitaryTerminalType“ &gt; OK<br/>
—&gt; notice: we weren’t asked about the „mandatory“ field &gt;&gt;PredefinedType&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
After inserting the symbol it has no IFC data attached. Why?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Further questions:<br/>
Are both ways working as they should?<br/>
If they aren’t, how should they be working?<br/>
Which workflow has which benefits over the other?<br/>
What should we tell our customers?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a real bug....:<br/>
<br/>
I can not find a possibility to leave this field completely empty:<br/>
<br/>
IfcWall or IfcWallStandardCase / Pset_WallCommon / ThermalTransmittance<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Usecase:<br/>
<br/>
If you use a IFC file for a thermal calculation, the inner walls mustn&#39;t have any value, because they have to be ignored. The goal is really to leave this field empty - a value like 0,00 means that the wall has an infinite good value.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Export both files to IFC format<br/>
-Open the exported files in Solibri or another BIM app<br/>
<br/>
Note that most of the symbols fail to show in the &quot;Pasted Symbols&quot; file, since their IFC data was removed during the copy-paste.<br/>
<br/>
The same problem occurs if the original symbols exist in a referenced source file, and an IFC export is done from the target file.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in previous versions.

We have successfully until now coordinated all our model data.<br/>

We have just received this IFC and I am unsure of how it has been issued and subsequently edited.<br/>
<br/>
You can see if you view the IFC in Solibri first, that the file is georeferenced, but also located correctly in terms of X and Y coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
It is also located correctly relative to the Z axis.  The reference elevation is 58.25m and the geometry reports dZ value of the same on the ground floor of &#39;BatB&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you import this into Vectorworks 2019 or 2020, none of the layer elevations are correct, when compared to the IFC levels.  These are actually the levels set by the user in Revit.<br/>
<br/>
I have the Revit file also but probably cannot issue it.  If you have any questions about the settings let me know.

We found that decimal numbers for feet and inches does not show up when Fractional Display for dimensions is set to be shown diagonally. It works fine when set to standard. <br/>

I have recorded a video showing the issue. I will mark this as critical as we have a user that will have to move back to 2017 as user is required to follow specific standards and cant have the information missing or not shown correctly.

With the dimension selected chose the 2D reshape tool<br/>
<br/>
Place a selection window around one end of the dimension<br/>
<br/>
invoke the move command to move the selection handle of the dimension. This should stretch the dimension.<br/>
<br/>
Notice the dimension does not stretch, instead the entire dimension moves.<br/>

On a side note, this bug appeared in an earlier release, a year or two ago. Why do we see the same bugs reappear upon a new release, year after year? Is it not possible to permanently put these behind us? Just curious, I don&#39;t code so I don&#39;t know all of what is involved.

<br/>
We have another report from Stanhope gate regarding the freezing when switching between tabs. This time in 2019. I believe we have the same issue with another user in 2020. Reported on https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-174839.<br/>
<br/>
From the user:<br/>
<br/>
_I have been experiencing the same issue with my Vectorworks, where if I have more than 1 file open Vectorworks will freeze on the newest file and I cannot switch to my original file unless I close the second file. I have double-checked that the graphics card setting is still set as per your email below._<br/>
<br/>
We believe the US tech team have also reported users with the same issue recently. <br/>
<br/>
We have tried everything to try to solve the issue. <br/>
<br/>
An old case regarding this issue. <br/>
<br/>
https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-150163<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a list of installed programs and the latest Diag from the user, <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen <br/>

4) An alert shows. Click Yes.<br/>
5) Create a viewport. (It&#39;s plain to see the problem if creating on a sheet layer.)<br/>
6) The bottom and the right edge lines don&#39;t show in the viewport.<br/>

The enclosed file will open up on a sheet layer. When trying to do anything, draw a circle, add some text etc there is a terrible lag often with the spinning ball. It makes working impossible at normal speed.<br/>
<br/>
If the Vectorworks Preferences&gt;Display&gt;Navigation Graphics&gt;is changed to Good Performance and Compatibility then it works as expected.<br/>
<br/>
This is true for the client who has a similar machine to mine. I have also included my system report. Yet Julian on his i9 16&quot; MBP also on Catalina has no such problems but at 8GB has twice the VRAM I have; nor is this a Windows problem.<br/>

3D and hybrid objects within symbols can be assigned a very un-useful &#39;Z&#39; elevation at creation.<br/>
<br/>
Frequently, constantly, all the time, I create unit plan symbols that I use to assemble apartment buildings. <br/>
<br/>
Frequently, the hybrid objects (walls, doors, windows, coat rods and others) are created at an elevation relative to sea level. They should be created relative to the symbol origin.<br/>
<br/>
Huge problem, unnecessary and makes VW very hard to use in 3D.<br/>

Please make it a priority to fix this. It has been an issue since VW 2010. I would be happy to help resolve it in anyway I can.<br/>

In previous betas this was not the case. There is a great advantage to being able to see the focus feedback on two different view panes as you can clearly see the height of the tilt as well as the spears of the pan. This important functionality has now been lost and it makes the new focus dialog less desirable.

                                            <td class="description">      A customer has contacted me saying he has been experiencing random crashing with his Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a crash log generated and there are a couple of crashes reported on analytics with these serial numbers:<br/>
<br/>
EGXMKZ-TZXKQL-ZCZNZZ-G0NW0T<br/>
<br/>
EFXMKZ-9Z0K6R-Z8Z0ZH-G0NW0T<br/>
<br/>
The customer says the only similarity with the crashing is that all files use the same template that has been with them since 2019.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They have also said that the crashing causes there to be no back up files generated. They are saving the files onto there G drive. The back up files are not being backed up to the server.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hunch that the crashing is linked with the file being saved in the G drive that is being synced with there server.<br/>
<br/>
I have made sure that Vectorworks has full disk access. We have tried reset user folders etc. But I am stumped what could be causing the issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you can shed some light on this from the crash logs etc.<br/>

<br/>
this customerfile from a VIP-customer lacks performance in Vectorworks 2020 and 2021. In Vectorworks 2018 customer is able to work, but it&#39;s a mess in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
I would have expected this file to run faster on Vectorworks 2021 than on 2018. Somehow there&#39;s alack of performance. Could you please have a look and maybe find out, why it runs so slow on 2020 and 2021 while it is okay with 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Switching unified view on, it works better. Purge command does not help.

Create a project file. In a working file create some geometry. Create a viewport on a sheet layer. Save and commit.<br/>

Save this working file as user1.vwxw. Close it.<br/>

Open the project file. New working file will open. <br/>
<br/>
Save this working file as user2.vwxw.<br/>
<br/>
Open user1.vwxw. Update the viewport (I changed scale). Save and commit.<br/>
<br/>
Switch to user2.vwxw. Activate the sheet layer and select the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
Now Refresh. All objects on the viewport become invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the layer or zooming fixes the problem.<br/>

I tested this in VW 2020 SP3B3 and this version seems to have partially resolved the issue as the slabs no longer turn invisible.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?

According to Task Manager, VW uses up to 2.4GB of RAM with this file.<br/>
What is the fault, what can be improved? We have already deliberately created a file without hatching for import.<br/>
Imported DWGs are generally difficult to edit because they are very slow to edit<br/>

Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Prepare a file includes unsupported character as its filename.<br/>
2) Open the VCS web portal.<br/>
3) Drag the file to the web and drop.<br/>
4) The file is uploaded but it shows “1 upload failed”.<br/>
5) The filename shows in the portal window.<br/>
6) Select it. But there are no icons on the menu bar and there are no menus if you right-click it.<br/>
7) The unsupported filename remains even you rename it on the local VCS folder.<br/>

<br/>
The VS error dialog pops up, and the event loop crashes. It looks to be due to a thrown exception. Exception and stack attached.<br/>
<br/>
-I think this is like similar things I&#39;ve commented on, that the exception has unwound something needed by the event or handler.-<br/>
<br/>
We are once again somehow attempting to show (debug assert) dialogs inside NSViewDrawRect. Not sure why it&#39;s not properly disabled.  Attached stack at throw.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this is just a debug issue.

When I update the viewport in question, it takes about 19 seconds to render on a Mac. But I see this issue on Window OS. It just runs the render in the status forever.<br/>
Can you submit this to the JIRA as a bug?<br/>

<br/>
We have many users in our market that depend on 2020 for many months longer than most users as they must await the release of ExtraGroup&#39;s Interiorcad plugin to be adapted for the new version. So I&#39;m hopeful we can get a fix for this included in 2020&#39;s SP6. <br/>
<br/>
Sheet Layer Viewports set to use Renderworks modes: <br/>
 * Are indicated as &#39;out-of-date&#39; as soon as they are updated. <br/>
 * Render in the Sheet Layer as blank/empty. <br/>
 * Are _always_ absent in the resulting PDF (Using Export or Publish). <br/>
 * BUT they can be made visible if the render mode is change to an alternative Renderworks mode after the Viewport is updated. <br/>
<br/>
*This issue only occurs in some files*, but every time in those files. Therefore: _Even if a fix can&#39;t be achieved in 2020_, it would be *great* if you could tell me what condition causes this problem so I can help our customers avoid it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve determined that: <br/>
 * Turning ON &#39;None fill uses Alpha Transparency&#39; helped one user, but not his colleague. <br/>
 * Having doc pref &#39;Save Viewport Cache&#39; doesn&#39;t prevent this problem. <br/>
 * Opening in 2021, then exporting to 2020 doesn&#39;t correct the problem or its cause. <br/>
 * Resetting Vectorworks Preferences doesn&#39;t correct the problem or its cause. <br/>
<br/>
The test workflow is: <br/>
 # (Adjust Viewport settings in OIP as-required). <br/>
 # File &gt; Export &gt; Export to PDF… OR File &gt; Publish… &gt; (to PDF)<br/>
 # Page range 3 to 3<br/>
<br/>
*Can you please advise what condition causes this problem?* <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I can successfully send to C4D with a nomal project file, but not working files, also, when I try to send from a project file after failing with the working file, the link is broken until VWX is restarted on the host computer. Work around is to create normal vwx document from working file before sending to C4D currently.

<br/>
Hi team, <br/>
<br/>
This user has been experiencing more crashes than is fair to expect but they seem to relate to this one file. I&#39;ve looked at it but nothing stands out to me so I&#39;m hoping you can use the crash logs and user data to identify what&#39;s going wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Last week I prescribed she update her graphics card driver and if it was already up-to-date, to do a clean installation instead. But then on the weekend following this she had about three more crashes. <br/>
<br/>
I have uploaded:<br/>
 * Reliability History<br/>
 * UserLogSent.txt<br/>
 * Crash logs<br/>
 * Dxdiag and<br/>
 * The lone file with which crashing occurred/occurs.<br/>
<br/>
I established she can&#39;t recall whether particular actions correlated with crashes, nor what she was doing at the time crashes occurred but the data should be in the attached I presume.

<br/>
Line Type: 15.13. Grenze Geltungsbereich_sw LN<br/>
<br/>
Viewports: 1/02 and 5/06<br/>
<br/>
Compare the screenshots: US-Version.png and DE-Version.png<br/>
<br/>
The Line Type is seen with the same size (width) in both Viewports when using the German Version (DE-Version.png), but when we open the same file with the US Version, then the Line Type is shown much smaller in the Viewport 1/02 (US-Version.png)<br/>
<br/>
Now comparing the Viewport 1/02 between both US and German Versions. If we double click the Viewport and enter Edit Mode, we see that in both versions the Line Type has the same size (small) like the size shown in the US Version Viewport. With the German Version the Line Type is seen much bigger (width wise) in the Viewport view of the German Version, just like its seen in the Viewport 5/06.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. US-Version: why is the Line Type doesn&#39;t have the same size in both Viewports? Its the same Line Type, should appear with the same width, be it in Viewport view or Edit mode.<br/>
<br/>
2. German Version: Line Type is seen with the same size in both Viewport views, but when going into Edit Mode of the Viewport 1/02, the Line Type is shown much small just like its shown in the US-Version. Is this expected?<br/>
<br/>
There is no consistency in how the Line Type is represented. Is there ideas why this is happening?

I had duplicated a cabinet and moved it, undoing the move resulted in a Beta alert and after undoing twice or so more I crashed. (This happened around 2:40pm today) I had not committed in a bit.

The panorama took about 50mins to upsample but it doesn&#39;t have a good resolution output. <br/>

Is there anything we can do to improve the output quality if it&#39;s machine learnt.

We verified his report, particularly with Offset tool (4 or 5 seconds). No problem if you try to use this file for example with Vectorworks 2014. We got the impression that it&#39;s a problem with 64 bit - versions. Please, could you have a loo? Thank you.

                Railing and Curtainwall issues
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      There are a series of issues that I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out. This file was created in 2020 and brought up into 2021 a few weeks ago.  There have been at least 5 2021 autobuild versions used for this file.  Most of the railings and curtainwalls were previously created without complication in 2020.  Meaning, they were accurately created and represented in the model as per the expectation.  Since using 2021 there have been a few more railings created in various locations (particularly on the roof).  I started to notice strange things beginning on this past Monday afternoon (build 559335 was installed Monday morning).<br/>
<br/>
The first thing noticed was that the custom symbol post used for the railings went corrupt resulting in a gap in the posts.  Later that day, many (not all) of the railings vanished from the file.  They were not turned off, they were gone.  Alternately, many of the curtainwalls had visibility issues.  They could not be seen but could be selected and bumped to regain their visibility.     <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I adjusted the custom post symbol which regained the correct appearance for the railing assembly.  Additionally, I copied and pasted railings from an older version of the file to replace those that went missing.  However, after several hours of working on various parts of the file, many of the railings disappeared again without prompting, notification or warning.  <br/>
<br/>
Vwx file, photos and a video are attached including pics of backup files that show various states of the issues occurring that were not noticed while working on the file.  Let me know if you&#39;d like me to walk you through the issues in more detail or via a screen share.<br/>

                Big customer: corrupted construction layer
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      A big customer of ours is having huge problems with several files, most of which are very likely related to referencing issues. Some files take almost an hour to open up, which obviously impacts their productivity.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problems with this file are two-fold:<br/>
1) one of the construction layers (--Erdgeschoss--) is corrupted with ghost objects<br/>
2) referencing certain construction layers into a viewport in a blank new file, takes forever<br/>
<br/>
The two important questions are:<br/>
a) Is it possible to restore the corrupted layer(s) and can it be done in a timely manner?<br/>
b) What is the underlying cause for the long loading process when referencing these layers into a viewport? Can we tell our customer a sure fire way to avoid a constallation where this is more likely to happen? (Do&#39;s &amp; Don&#39;ts?)<br/>
<br/>
Problem 1: (see video)<br/>
Files attached: 258-BF11-Haus-5-v2019.vwx and 258-BF11-Haus-5-v2020.vwx<br/>
1) Open file in 24.0.6 (522773), 25.0.2 (523565) or 25.0.3b (529360)<br/>
2) Classes visible (all), layers visibe (--Erdgeschoss–)<br/>
3) Select all: 20 objects<br/>
4) Deselect lower half: still 20 objects selected<br/>
5a) Select all section viewports using the &quot;select similar&quot; tool: OIP says 7, but only 4 are visibly selected.<br/>
5b) When deselecting the lowest viewport the count in the OIP doesn&#39;t change<br/>
5c) When deselecting all visible viewports, 4 are left.<br/>
5d) When doing any of the following actions while having those 4 left selected, VW will hang (or maybe just take an absurd amount of time):<br/>
   * move (using the duplicate tool)<br/>
   * Update (OIP)<br/>
   * set a number for X or Y<br/>
6) On 2019 SP6 (Mac) and 2020 SP2 (Windows) two ghost viewports are always visible, on 2019 SP6 (Windows) and 2020 SP2 (Mac) these are only visible when zooming.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2:<br/>
1) Open new blank file<br/>
2) draw a rectangle<br/>
3) create new viewport using the attached file as source using the settings shown in the screenshot.<br/>
4) VW will hang (or take an absurd amount of time) when activating only the following construction layer (all being set to invisible):<br/>
   * --Erdgeschoss--<br/>
   * Haus 2_03<br/>
   * Haus 2_02<br/>
   * Haus 2_01<br/>
   * Haus 2_00<br/>
   * Haus 2_U1<br/>

<br/>
attached dwg-file freezes Vectorworks 2020. After import everything seem to be fine. Change to the design layer and select and deselect the objects in the middle or right. Beachball of death appears...<br/>
<br/>
See testfile, dwg-file and video.<br/>
<br/>
I also tested with Vectorworks 2021 SP1. Here everything&#39;s fine. So it is only Vectorworks 2020. Maybe you could fix for SP6.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe you could tell me which object is causing this so the customer could modify his dwg-file. Thanks.

Il you open this file in Vw 2021 and try to update the Section Viewport that you first see, you will get a sort of shifting of annotations as to Section Viewport objects, a sort of delocalization to the right. If you open the file in Vw 2020 and update the same Viewport, there is no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Even in Vw 2021 it seems that behavior of Section Viewports in the file is not the same for all of them.<br/>

Please, could you have a look? <br/>

<br/>
They have had problems with geometry shifting many times in these files. We have been in to see them, and explained the importance of having a common set of coordinates over the internal origin. However, when they open this project, they find that the Topo (and other references not included in the bundle) shift way out of alignment.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot see a reason for it, other than the fact that they want to keep their files saved in a rotated plan view. The reference is a design layer viewport reference, so there is no option to ignore user origin in source file (although these should be the same anyway after my work).<br/>
<br/>
When we first received these files, the coordinates on the internal origin were not the same. So, I fixed them using the large circle over a common reference point method, and then centred the geometry. All was well when I left their office, but now it&#39;s happening again and I can&#39;t see a reason for it. <br/>
<br/>
I also tested moving the files to 2020, but the same thing is happening. <br/>
<br/>
Any pointers very gratefully received. <br/>

I hope you are all OK working in isolation. It&#39;s very strange...

In the previous submittal, objects from the &#39;bone yard&#39; design layer would sometimes appear in  the 3d view which was generated from visible objects in the wall, roof &amp; floor layers. This time, though I can&#39;t tell for sure, it looks like the ghosted objects are from the exterior elevations sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
Please see: http://www.tmadesign.com/DesignLab/Gotcher/Gotcher_SD1_exterior/index.html which was an initial 3d view while developing the roof.<br/>

<br/>
Add new breakpoint in _LLSendCreateNotification where ObjectStateData_ObjectCreated is constructed.<br/>
<br/>
Duplicate the layer and note that the ObjectCreated state is send twice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem comes from SendCreateNotification. It&#39;s called once for the layer itself, where it traverses all its children nodes, and once for each of the contained nodes, see call stacks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Further testing shows even more problems: When the create state is send by traversing the layer, parametric object&#39;s parent is the source layer, not the duplicated one. When the state is send for the duplicated parametric object, it&#39;s sill not inserted in the document - it&#39;s parent is null.<br/>
<br/>
Testing the different duplication methods, only the Paste command sends ObjectCreated state when the parametric object is added in the destination container. Other duplication menus (duplicate, duplicate array) and tools (Rotate, move by points) send creation states before adding the object to the destination container.

In the attached screen recording you can see that it fails to recognize various edges of the shape, but as soon as I switch to orthogonal projection it works like a charm.<br/>
<br/>
While this example shows the Fillet Edge tool, this issue likely applies to all edge-based selections like Chamfer Edge, Extract, etc. (I don&#39;t think this is specific to any particular build - it&#39;s an issue I&#39;ve been noticing for quite a while).<br/>
<br/>
These processes needs to work just as easily in perspective as they do in orthogonal.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
• Create a class (such as &quot;2D-Section Lines&quot;) and set the class attributes to be blue and a particular Line Style. Check the &quot;Use at Creation&quot; checkbox.<br/>
<br/>
• Independently from that, create a Section-Elevation Line Style.<br/>
<br/>
• Go to the RM, right click and choose &quot;Plug-In Object Style Options&quot; and set the Default Class to &quot;2D-Section Lines&quot; and make the class &quot;By Style&quot; so that all instances insert on to that class automatically.<br/>
<br/>
• Make the Active Class &quot;None&quot; and set the Attributes Palette to NOT be by-class (such as white fill, solid black line).<br/>
<br/>
• Insert an instance of the Section-Elevation Line style. It inserts correctly on to the &quot;2D-Section Lines&quot; class, but the Attributes for that instance remain as black and white, rather than by style (blue dashed).<br/>
<br/>
• This is inconsistent with how the &quot;Use at Creation&quot; checkbox usually works. I would expect that the Attributes for this newly-created object would end up By Class regardless of my Attributes Palettes setting.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also Ideally the report would automatically know what materials are available in the project to generate itself as materials are likely to change from project to project and during a project.<br/>
<br/>
Again this might be my limited worksheet knowledge<br/>

In the attached file the coloured worksheets show what Ive managed to get out but its very convoluted and you don&#39;t seem to be able to report materialproperty() data for component based objects.<br/>

I know others are looking at this so they may have further comments for customer requirtements.<br/>

If you do the same think twice it works correctly.<br/>

Every time you need to validate the stories and then go into the stories to change the value you tried to change before.<br/>
<br/>
That makes a lot of confusion for the users. Because you do the same think for two dimes, first times don&#39;t work, second time is ok. Please fix this. Thanks<br/>

Our workflow is to import these into VectorWorks, tidy up the geometry (removing notes etc), copy and paste the geoetry into a design layer, then apply a scale factor to scale it up to the correct size.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file - which is typical - selecting content causes VW2021 to run extremely slowly. This is on Windows 10, latest build, Dell Precision 7910 with dual Xeon processors, 32GB RAM, 4GB FirePro with latest certified drivers for SolidWorks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In particular  -selecting the 3D views to delete these takes around 10 mins to process.<br/>
<br/>
Then selecting the notes CHS88.9x5 in the upper view and hitting delete takes 3-4 seconds each.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For comparison I tested importing this into Rhino 6 and selection is near instantaneous.

VIDEO 1: You can see how snappy and fast OSX is with zooming, and spinning this model in OSX Preview. <br/>
VIDEO 2: When imported into Vectorworks, it totally conks out. Zooming and orbit is slow, and double-click into it to give the meshes a ‘fill’ becomes a fatal operation<br/>
SOFA.STL: This is the file that was used in Videos 1 and 2<br/>
AR_1701 v352.vwx: This is the file that we find to be sometimes slow in general navigation, because of our need to keep complex meshes for rendering quality in other apps (such as twinmotion)<br/>

I started a session on the GMA3. DMX output goes over sACN.<br/>
A moving head, Robe T1, receives the sACN network data via the network.<br/>
The sACNview app shows me the data correctly on the MacBook in Universe 1. Only VISION doesn&#39;t do anything. There the DMX Viewer only shows 0. I switched the provider to sACN. <br/>
 <br/>
Switching off wifi helped. When I start VISION without WIFI I receive Artnet and sACN. When VISIOn is running I can turn on WiFi again. There only needs to be disable WIFI connection to start VISION. Changing the priority of Network-cards in the OSX setup did not help either. I use a Network Adapter over TB 3

<br/>
in this customer file it is impossible to export sheet layer 300.1 (TG/UG- A). It&#39;s the top right one  in the multiple windows. 2020 SP4 crashes and 2021 SP1 b2 seems to freeze.<br/>
<br/>
Did some research. It seems to a keynote legend object. See viewport &quot;3/303&quot; on that sheet layer top right.

After Marissa had finished her work for the day (around 4:30) I tried to commit a few times, and almost every time I got the &quot;Project file is locked...&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
Once I try a second time it always works fine, so there&#39;s something about the first commit attempt that&#39;s acting-up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not sure how it got into this state but I&#39;ve attached the Project file, my Working file, my user logs, and my PSTimingLog. Marissa will also upload her WF, user log, and PSTimingLog shortly.<br/>
<br/>
The PF we were working on is located on the 22001 server under /Projects/QA 2021 Project/8657 Tower Drive.vwxp.<br/>
<br/>
I started noticing this around 4:00pm today, but I don&#39;t have a more specific time than that. As shown in the screenshot it was still happening at 8:00pm, in case that helps.<br/>
<br/>
I also got a dialog saying that Srilakshmi had the file locked (see second screenshot), even though she wasn&#39;t actively working on the project either. Again it worked fine as soon as I clicked &quot;Retry&quot;.

After rebooting my router and reopening the file, I was eventually able to save and commit and Tim could then work in the file.<br/>

I had storms roll through this morning which may have been affecting my internet quality, unsure if this could be related.

<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed a few issues with search options in the web portal.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, searching field in the Home location displays improper hint &quot;SzukajStrona główna&quot; with no space between two words. I&#39;d like to adjust it somehow, but I&#39;m not sure if I can find this string somewhere in Crowdin? I didn&#39;t manage to find it, but I guess it&#39;s a combination of two separate strings: search + home. The problem is that in Polish I need to use a different form of &quot;Home&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Second of all, an icon of a magnifying glass in the Help section is really small and difficult to find for users. Is there any chance to add a search field next to it or make it stand out more?<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, searching returns either no results (Brak wyników), but I&#39;m sure those terms are present in the help, or returns results in English. The good thing is that when you click on that English link, you go to the proper Polish section.

                VW Freezes/Crashes When Creating Symbol After Undo

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the two symbols at the top of the drawing<br/>
-Create a symbol using Page-based units<br/>
-Now Undo the symbol creation<br/>
-Group the objects<br/>
-Create a symbol from the Group<br/>
<br/>
Note that now VW (usually) freezes. You may have to Undo and repeat the steps a few times to see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
If I skip any of the steps the freeze won&#39;t occur.<br/>
<br/>
Using the same steps, I&#39;ve also seen this crash a few times on Mac. It doesn&#39;t happen consistently though and didn&#39;t generate a crash log. <br/>
<br/>
If I try this on Windows 10 I get a consistent crash (dump file attached).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this in VW 2020 so it looks like a 2021 regression.<br/>

In the import dialog ensure the radio button &quot;Import the GIS features in the shapefile&#39;s coordinate system&#39; is on.<br/>
<br/>
In the import dialog ensure that &#39;Set the document&#39;s coordinate system to match&#39; is checked.<br/>
<br/>
OK<br/>
<br/>
Zoom to fit objects<br/>
<br/>
Edit the settings for Design Layer -1 to turn on ensure the checkbox for &quot;Georeferencing&#39; is turned on.<br/>
<br/>
Make Design layer-1 active.<br/>
<br/>
Import the attached .ecw file (this image should correspond with the geometry from the shape file.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the import image options as default and ok<br/>
<br/>
Note that the image imported does NOT line up with the geometry from the shape file but that the coordinates seem to match the user coordinate location. (This is the problem)  <br/>
<br/>
If you place a GIS stake at the lower left corner of the image and set the display to &#39;Coordinate Point(XY)&#39; you get the same value as the name of the file would suggest.  At this point the user origin is the same as the internal origin. (see file &quot;TEST 1.vwx)<br/>
<br/>
Using &quot;Tools&gt;Origin&gt;User Origin set the user origin to match the georeferencing coordinate system<br/>
<br/>
Note that the GIS Stake no longer shows the same xy coordinates as the file would suggest is correct (This is expected)<br/>
<br/>
Import the image again.  Note that the image comes in at the same location as before. This confirms that it is not using the user origin.<br/>
<br/>
Place a GIS stake at 0,0   with the display set to Coordinate Point (NE) units Meters.<br/>
<br/>
Zoom to fit.<br/>
<br/>
Change the display to &#39;Coordinates (XY)&#39; to confirm that the NE and the XY are now the same.<br/>
<br/>
Using the geolocate tool in the &quot;Locate Mode&quot; click on the insertion point of the O,O stake.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the xy coordinates change as expected <br/>
<br/>
Using Tools&gt;Origin&gt;User Origin set the user origin to match the Georeferencing coordinate system.  Note that the XY coordinates are now aligned with the geographic coordinate system which is aligned with the internal origin.<br/>
<br/>
Import the image file again.  Zoom to fit.  Note that the image file now aligns with the shape file imported earlier.  (TEST 2.vwx)<br/>
<br/>
Why is this a bug.  When importing a georeferenced image into a georeferenced layer the user would expect that the image is placed correctly with regard to the Geographic Coordinate system.  The workaround is too involved and, because it relocated the internal origin remote from the &#39;site&#39; is not good practice and doesn&#39;t work with the workflows shown in the training videos.

Another thing with this Marionette is that it will freeze VWX if debugged from within the object. (Switch the Marionette Tool to debug and click on a wire).<br/>

                Window Insertion Into Wall F&#39;s Up Texture Alignment

</td>

I have wondered for years why simple wall textures (like horizontal siding) constantly seem to need re-alignment. This might be the answer: when a window is inserted into a wall it messes with the texture alignment.<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: Open file. Note that the siding texture aligns perfectly at the corner where the two walls intersect.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: Insert the window into the wall (the one to which it is aligned, in Top/Plan). Note that the wall texture has moved. <br/>
<br/>
This is unbelievably bad. Please fix it ASAP.<br/>

I suspect that we&#39;re walking off the end of the Handle&#39;s data when parsing its stack symbols.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a bug in the parser code, needing to know a size limit, or if we&#39;re not putting a terminator on DVs data, or something else. We have mucked with material functions and their numbers of parameters, but it shouldn&#39;t be that.

 <br/>
The direct cause is probably that we changed MaterialProperties to take a material name and a property name.  The file is likely from slightly earlier, when it took a single property parameter and inferred the material from the object/criteria. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if all the Bind* stuff should be refactored to have an end limit that goes along with the starting pointer.  strncpy-ish.  It always starts from a handle or celldata, and we should know the cliff at the end.<br/>

Customers believe that the dot should be allowed to be used with the same function has the comma, because the format of some other software is with a dot and not a comma.

<br/>
I get two reports with the same criterions (area and layer) on the same worksheet. When I want to so a division between the both total areas from report lists, it works in a neutral cell. If the formula is in a cell in the report list with the larger total area, the result is the same as in the neutral cell. If I add the formula to the smaller value, the result is 0. Strange is when the result from the neutral cell is taken over in a cell form a report list. Here too, gets me two different results. When the result is taken over in the report list with the smaller total area, the result changes to a #DIV 0! value. In the bigger total area the result is 0.<br/>
I suspect it shouldn&#39;t be like that and it should work in every cell. Or are there special rules for formulas for report lists?<br/>
I attache my test file a a movie with my steps.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Denis<br/>

<br/>
So My first column is numbered vertically 1,2,3,4 or 1001, 1002, 1003, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1st cell of the column the paste is perfect, but every cell below that has a space and line return added before the data, causing all the numbers to fail to show, even though they are there.  If I paste the exact same data into the second column, it pastes as expected.  This is a very longstanding BUG and it drives me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe it may be font related, It seems that Geneva Font (which is not a real font) works OK, but Arial and Helvetica, which are all we. use do not.

 About Problem<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 Despite setting the units to &quot;kilometers&quot;,if I export the 3D PDF and use the Acrobat&#39;s 3D Dimension Tool, the unit will always be in meters.<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
 1) Set the Units setting to &quot;kilometers&quot;.<br/>
 2) Draw an Extrude.<br/>
 3) Export 3D PDF (3D).<br/>
 4) Open the PDF file with Acrobat.<br/>
<br/>
*To make 3D, click &quot;?&quot; on the upper left.<br/>
 *To use the 3D Dimension Tool, click the &quot;Rotate&quot; icon in the upper left.<br/>
<br/>
5) Despite setting the units to &quot;kilometers&quot;,all are expressed in &quot;meters&quot; in Acrobat.<br/>
<br/>
・VW: 10 milons → Acrobat: 0.01 meters<br/>
 ・VW: 1000 micron → Acrobat: 1 meter<br/>
 ・VW: 10 mm → Acrobat: 10 meters<br/>
 ・VW: 1000 mm → Acrobat: 1000 meters<br/>
 ・VW: 10 meters → Acrobat: 1000000 meters<br/>
 ・VW: 100 meters → Acrobat: 100000000 meters<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;movie12274.mov&quot;, &quot;Untitled1_v2015.vwx&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 *According to the user, he said that it is operating normally with v2016.<br/>
 (Millimeters are millimeters, meters are meters, kilometers are kilometers)<br/>
<br/>
*He said that it&#39;s impossible to work and use above v2017.<br/>
<br/>
*He said that it would be difficult to continue VSS because he has to use Vectorworks that was three generations older than the user policy.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in each version and activate the Reshape tool with the SM selected.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020, note that the filleted corners of the SM only have one vertex, making it easy to drag the corners to a new location.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021 note that there are extra vertices on the corners, making them difficult to reshape.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens with SM objects that are created in VW 2021. You can duplicate this shape by setting the radius for the Fillet tool to roughly 6&quot;, then using the Arc Vertex Mode of the SM tool.

Same process in 2020, made any class other than none active and inserted the same data tag on a generic unstyled wall.   The Tag is on the active class.

See also the https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/78422-landscape-area-style-question/<br/>
<br/>
When creating a new style from unstyled instance using the &#39;New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in&#39; choice from the Style popup widget, the class is set &#39;by style&#39; and the Class widget in the OIP is disabled.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
- open the test file - it contains an unstyled landscape area and an unstyled data tag object.<br/>
- select any of them<br/>
- use &#39;New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in&#39; to create a new style from the unstyled object<br/>
- note that the Class widget is disabled<br/>
(see also the attached video).<br/>
<br/>
I did some debugging and it turned out that what causes this behavior is the following line in the function void InitializePluginStyle( SymDefHandle symDef ):<br/>
<br/>
// Default is by style<br/>
(*(ParametricHandle)thePluginObj)-&gt;SetClassByStyle( true );

<br/>
To reproduce, open the files in VW 2018 and VW 2019.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the walls work fine in VW 2018, but in 2019/2020 one of the Walls becomes corrupted (see attached screenshots).<br/>
<br/>
I also see the problem on Windows 10 but it&#39;s the opposite wall compared to Mac (if the right wall gets corrupted on Mac, the left wall will get corrupted on Windows).

-Export the file to any previous version<br/>
-Open the file in the previous version<br/>
-Reshape the SM objects<br/>
<br/>
Note that they disappear.<br/>
<br/>
If I try other operations on the SMs it works fine, so this looks like a Reshape problem.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens when exporting to other prior versions (tested back to VW 2018).<br/>
<br/>
If I create the same objects in VW 2020 and export to prior versions, I don&#39;t see the problem.

To reproduce, open the file in each version and resize the vertical SM so that it connects with the diagonal SM.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, note that the diagonal SM gets highlighted as long as the cursor touches its geometry.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, note that the highlighting flickers on and off randomly.<br/>
<br/>
If the objects are connected during a drawing operation (as opposed to a resize operation) this problem won&#39;t occur.

<br/>
It isn&#39;t possible to override a round wall  in the hight with one component. Has the round wall two components, it&#39;s works to override the hight over the menu &quot;components&quot;. The same have I tested with linear walls and there is it work a override with one component.<br/>
<br/>
I attached a test file with various walls, to show the differences.<br/>

<br/>
-Start a new document, you can use a blank or architect template.<br/>
-Draw four walls.<br/>
-Create a roof on those 4 walls.<br/>
-In one of the roof side click on one of the handles.<br/>
-The Edit Roof Settings dialog should appear.<br/>
-Change it to Gable with the default value.<br/>
-Check in the option &quot;Show Wall&quot;<br/>
-Notice the gable wall will not aligh with the wall.<br/>
-Try changing the Thickness of the Gable Wall, notice thickness will adjust inward not <br/>
 outward to align with wall outside.<br/>
 This is happening from 2018 to 2020. The last where the gable wall would alight with the wall by default was 2017 version.<br/>

If we draw two Polygons that touch in a 90 degree position and use Fillet, it will work. Although, the fillet is done and we can see the Arc in the drawing, the original edges of the Polygons remain in place. Is this WAD or a Bug?<br/>
<br/>
If we draw two Polylines in the same way, we get a pop up that says: Parallel lines cannot be filleted or chamfered.<br/>
<br/>
If its not possible with a Polylines, then why is it possible with Polygons?

                Various roof issues
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I was hoping to be able to narrow down steps and determine a progression that seem to lead to some of these issues, but there seems to be multiple factors. Many of the issues have been on going for years which makes me wonder if it&#39;s operator error or my process. Regardless, editing roof faces has been a constant game of &#39;whack a mole&#39; to get them to edit and show properly:<br/>
<br/>
Related factors may be:<br/>
-roof styles &amp; their components<br/>
-roof tail types<br/>
-rendering mode- GL<br/>
-the Reshape tool, clipping &amp; adding with geometry<br/>
-mirroring or flipping roof faces<br/>
<br/>
Some problems observed:<br/>
-GL Rendered views often show roof faces with hollow cavities. Entering edit mode and exiting often &#39;pops&#39; it back. Then later on &#39;problematic&#39; roof faces revert to a &#39;hollow mode&#39;.<br/>
-Additional lines and/or polygons are discovered with not an apparent source other than a reshape, clip or add surface step requiring finding and removal of &#39;strays&#39;<br/>
-when in edit mode, lines are not visible, making it (see Where&#39;s Waldo bug submittal) difficult to fix geometry within the roof face container.<br/>
-deleting extra vertices using the reshape tool does not seem to work well and entering the  roof face container is required to clean up polygons. Some of these extra vertices appear after editing as mentioned above.<br/>
-the join roof tool seems to add some &#39;shakiness&#39; to the roof faces. I will need to focus on this again, but I believe a few &#39;hangs&#39; or crashes occurred after joining roof faces and then trying to edit them.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a recent schematic design file where a LOT of roof editing occurred in a short period of time and all of the above issues were ongoing. I need to go back into the roof geometry and clean up intersections between roof faces and the geometry of each due to inherent inaccuracies during the rapid conceptualization process.<br/>
<br/>
As I can narrow down steps, I&#39;ll, add to this bug.

<br/>
The tiles from the components aren&#39;t parallel with the roofangle, when I add a skylight in a roof face.<br/>
I attached you my test file with a section viewport, to show the differences.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
By opening and comparing both files, we can easily see the imperfections in the Lines Display of the 2020 file. We already had more than a Customer complaning about this problem and in this specific case the Client refuses to use the 2020 version until this is solved.<br/>

I have marked this as a Regression, because of the 2019 - 2020 differences.<br/>

The walls, which are clipped by the roof correctly in the original referenced file (Blok A), are not clipped at all in the main document (totaal). I have no idea how this has happened. I tried to reproduce this with two blank documents, but it seems to be only in this file.<br/>
<br/>
Answer tech support:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I have taken this file apart and put it back together and it always stops clipping the roof. I even referenced that roof level into a completely new file and the walls do not follow the roof.<br/>
<br/>
Could you send this to engineering as a JIRA?<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the Wall tool in Polygon Mode with Right Control Line Mode active<br/>
-Click on the left end of the bottom horizontal wall, then acquire a snap extension from the other wall as shown<br/>
<br/>
In 2019, note that the tool allows you to draw a second segment so you can connect with the other horizontal wall (though sometimes it&#39;ll auto-draw that second segment which wasn&#39;t ideal).<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, note that the tool only lets you draw one segment.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2020 SP0. This also happens in 2021.

Change any of this, the results change.  If the roof is created with a style, or assigned a style after, the faces immediately get the style. Actually, do anything that touches the roof (nudge) and the faces get the style.<br/>

Seems like there&#39;s a brief spot that&#39;s missing replicating the style to the faces.<br/>

In the Sheet Layer Section Viewport, override the attributes (eg; pen colour and thickness).<br/>

[Workaround: Return to the Design Layer and edit the Slab Components. Do not make any changes. Click OK. Notice this triggers the VP to require an update. Update the VP. Observe the VP Class Overrides will now stick.]

<br/>
A user has found a bit of a bug with the trim command. Please find the attached video showing the issue. <br/>
<br/>
When he goes to trim a wall with a line in rotate plan the windows disappear or arent allocated to the wall anymore. If you arent in the rotate plan all if ok. <br/>
<br/>
I have tested this in 2020 and also in 2021 and get the same outcome. <br/>

Steps to reproduce the IFC Export where this is happening:<br/>
 1. Unshelve CL 558342<br/>

2. Put breakpoint into ExportWall.cpp on line: 1293<br/>
<br/>
3. Open the bug file: Testfile 20201518_07.vwx<br/>
<br/>
4. Go to File -&gt; Export -&gt; Export IFC Project... -&gt; click on &quot;Layer Mapping&quot; tab -&gt; add the &quot;Konstruktionsebene - 1&quot; to the &quot;Mapped Layers&quot; -&gt; Click &quot;Export&quot; button and save the file somewhere.<br/>

</td>

<br/>
However, when a roof face is connected to walls and the components of the roof face interact with the components of the walls, this tool is useless. The components have an offset compared to the roof edge, but on a small trangle at the spot of the connection between the roof faces, all components extend to the roof edge.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce<br/>
<br/>
Draw two roof faces with different angles.<br/>
<br/>
The roof style has multiple compnents which interact with wall components.<br/>
<br/>
Connect them with 4 walls. connect the roof faces with the connect/combine tool with the mitter join method activated<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Attention!<br/>
<br/>
The connection between these two roof faces should be in the middle of the rectangle formed by the walls, or else one of the roof faces will bug.<br/>

<br/>
This has been reported by one of the UK resellers on behalf of one their customers.<br/>
<br/>
Their workflow is:<br/>
 # Create an Oval.<br/>
 # Clip the Oval with a Rectangle.<br/>
 # Extrude the clipped oval.<br/>
 # Extract the surface of the extrude.<br/>
 # Send to CNC machine for cutting. <br/>
<br/>
There is a discrepancy between the original polyline that forms the extrude, and the extracted shape as demonstrated in the attached file. The customer has cut panelling which is the wrong size and is complaining about how much this has cost them.<br/>
<br/>
We need to find more information about this workflow. For example, why are they not using the original polyline to cut? Why the extraction.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the meantime, it would be great to get an explanation of why there is this discrepancy.<br/>
<br/>
The file shows the process, and then shows a zoomed scale version showing the discrepancy in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can give us in explaining this.

1. Select the 4 3D Polygons like done in the video and copy them to the side to use them for the test.<br/>
<br/>
If the 3D Polygons are converted one by one to Polygon, nothing wrong happens.<br/>
<br/>
If the 3D Polygons are converted to Polygons all at once, the Object Data will be switched. ObjectID, GE_CODE, etc. will be switched between the top left corner object and the bottom right corner object.

--------------------------<br/>
When creating a complex line type, an unintended misalignment occurs despite adjusting the distance.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the same figure is drawn with the polygon tool, it will not misalign.<br/>
(Drawing a vertical straight line with the polygon tool will not misalign.)<br/>

If we create a new roof, its then possible to place both windows in the right locaiton.<br/>

Is it possible to find what caused this situation? Thank you in advance.

<br/>
 Typically when we create a Custom Sash, it&#39;s possible to change one of the Sashes to be a larger size than the overall window, but it will revert to the correct size if we go back to the field.  If we hit OK before doing that, the size will remain incorrect.<br/>

I&#39;ve included a video (and a document) displaying this behavior, if that helps explain it.  Please keep me posted if I can be of any further assistance, and have an awesome day!  :)

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the settings dialog and change the Configuration to &quot;Cased Opening&quot;<br/>
-Now change it back to &quot;Simple&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the settings are all retained.<br/>
<br/>
-Now change the Configuration to &quot;Opening&quot; and then change it back to &quot;Simple&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that now all the leaf-related settings (including Hardware) get reset to default.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense that the irrelevant settings would get grayed-out when the &quot;Opening&quot; config is chosen but I don&#39;t think they should get reset. This becomes a problem if, for example, a user accidentally chooses the &quot;Opening&quot; config.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

6) Choose the “Classes” pane. Most of classes are “&lt;Door Class&gt;”.<br/>
This means the classes aren’t loaded properly.<br/>
7) Click OK to close, and place the door object to a design layer.<br/>
8) Open the “Settings” on OIP.<br/>
9) The classes display proper on the “Classes” pane.<br/>
10) Dismiss the dialog and go to the Door Tool Preferences, again.<br/>
11) Click the “Use Style” pulldown, double-click the same one with currently selecting and the classes display properly.<br/>

Model is referenced from 1416_MH_PROJECT FILE to 1416_MH_PF_ELEVATIONS (sheet No MH-OMI-RW-EL-DR-A-L1602-P01 you can see the issue on screenshot). In ELEVATIONS file some of the Symbols are not referenced correctly - see _1416_Novice Bay_level 01_Type 1 - Handed_ and _1416_Senior Bay Level 01_ and smaller Window inside those Symbols - Window Style _1416_W-19.A_S/O 1060 x 685_ is not displaying a Tag. I can fix it by simply replacing that Window Style with any other and replacing it back, Save and update reference. <br/>
<br/>
Why would only few Window Styles behave like this? Is this a known bug? Can they do something to avoid this issue in future?<br/>

-Activate the Move By Points tool with Object Retention Mode enabled<br/>
-Make a duplicate copy of the SMs<br/>

Note that this causes the join to fail.<br/>

If the members are duplicated with the Duplicate command then moved with the Move command, the problem won&#39;t happen.<br/>

Open the settings again and change the 3D attributes back to By Object and exit the dialog. The brick texture remains.<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is similar to the behavior of removing a material from a standard object, the texture of the material will remain on the object, however, for the Structural Member, the Material is not removed from the object so users may expect the SM to go back to the pink color defined by the 2D attributes pane.

<br/>
The top Group (Layer E1-Obergeschoss 1) has a End Cap Miter of 0,000 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom Group (Layer E0-Erdgeschoss) has a End Cap Miter of 0,001 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
They both look exactly the same, despite the degree difference. Thats because the Customer complains about an innacuracy in the Structural Members and has compensated this situation with 0,001 degrees in the End Cap Miter.<br/>
<br/>
By Exporting and Importing back as IFC, it is possible to see that both Structural Member groups aren&#39;t the same if 0,000 degrees in the End Cap Miter.

                Structural Member Columns Get Rotated Incorrectly
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a few column-type SM objects; one that&#39;s un-rotated and one that&#39;s rotated 45º. I&#39;ve also added a few rectangles to show the current bounding box of the SM.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the SM on the left and run the &quot;Rotate Left 90º&quot; command a few times<br/>
<br/>
Note that the SM gets rotated around the same center point with each rotation.<br/>
<br/>
-Now rotate the plan as shown<br/>
-Select the SM on the right and again rotate it 90º<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it gets rotated around a different center point, making it difficult to control.<br/>
<br/>
If you rotate to the same angle using the Rotation field in the OIP, it&#39;ll get rotated as expected.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens when not in rotated plan, though it seems more obvious when rotated plan is active.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

In VW 2020 poly members could only be reshaped along the X/Y axes, so this is new to 2021.

In VW 2020 there were a bunch of additional problems with rotated networks, so this isn&#39;t a regression.

Note that everything looks fine at this point.<br/>

In VW 2020 the joins would just fail once the elevation of the member was changed.

 Target environment<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 Win Mac<br/>
 It occurs in v2020.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
 How to Reproduce<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 When switching the edit surface on the 2D Component edit screen for a specific symbol, there is a timing at which figure is not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;2Dcomponent_Sample_v2020.vwx&quot; and follow the steps below.<br/>
<br/>
1) Turn [Unified View] on.<br/>
<br/>
2) Enter the symbol editing screen from Resource Manager.<br/>
 * It does not occur when it enters the symbol editing screen from a placed symbol on the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
3) Switch the editing screen between [Right] and [left(and Right) Cut] alternately with Component Edit.<br/>
<br/>
4) There is a timing at which a figure is not displayed.<br/>
 * Even if the figure disappears, it can be selected by moving the mouse cursor.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 -It does not occur in v2019.<br/>
<br/>
-Even if only the target symbol is copied to a new file, it occurs.<br/>
<br/>
-It does not occur if it is verified with a newly created test symbol.<br/>
<br/>
-Changing the settings of [Navigation Graphics] and [GDI+imaging] has no effect.<br/>
<br/>
-It does not occur if [Unified View] turns off.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;2Dcomponent_Sample_v2020.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie10619.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It cannot be determined whether it is a problem of specific symbol data or a software problem.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in VW 2020<br/>
-Activate the SM tool using &quot;Create Similar Object&quot;<br/>
-Draw an SM between the locus points as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that the SM&#39;s 2D graphics are trimmed so that they join cleanly with the existing SM (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
-Now open the file in VW 2021 and try the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the 2D graphics show incorrectly (see second screenshot). <br/>
<br/>
The 3D geometry shows fine so this only affects 2D.<br/>
<br/>
If you try the same thing using the locus points on &quot;Layer B&quot; (which are placed slightly more towards the center of the existing SM) the problem won&#39;t occur.<br/>

To reproduce, in any 3D view, activate the SM tool in poly mode and draw a member that snaps to the locus points.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the SM always gets drawn on the layer plane.<br/>
<br/>
Since poly-type SMs now support 3D reshaping in 2021, where each vertex can be moved to any point on the Z-axis, users will probably expect this to work like similar objects (NURBS Curve, 3D Poly) that can be drawn directly on those 3D points.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the horizontal SM and change its elevation using the Move 3D command<br/>
-Now Undo the move<br/>
<br/>
Note that the control point of one of the joined members now shows in the wrong location. If you try to move that member you can see that its join has been lost.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from 2020.

                Structural Member - Joined Poly Members Fail After Being Moved

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Go to a Front view and drag-duplicate the poly member (using the Option key) and make a copy as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that this works fine.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try to move the new copy that was just made<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the vertices of the original poly member get moved upward.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes this can be easily fixed with the Reshape tool but other times it causes everything to get out-of-whack.<br/>
<br/>
This didn&#39;t happen in VW 2020, where poly members didn&#39;t allow Z-axis movement of individual vertices.

To reproduce, open the file in each version and enter a negative Offset value for the Start and End Conditions.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020, note that this offsets the ends inward toward the center of the member.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021, note that this offsets the ends outward.<br/>
<br/>
The 2020 behavior is more consistent with other VW features that involve +/- offsets.

-Place a default column-type SM<br/>
-Change its End Offset to 0&quot;<br/>

In 2021, note that the geometry fails to show in 2D and 3D.<br/>

This is most noticeable with Story-bound SMs where you can end up with 0&quot; height if you accidentally choose the wrong story level.

 # Open the attached VWX file<br/>
You will see a Campanile plug-in object and a Rectangle<br/>
 # Copy the Rectangle<br/>
 # Edit the 2D Components of the Campanile object<br/>
 # Paste the Rectangle<br/>
*Issue 1:* The Object Info palette says &quot;No Selection&quot; although it shows controls for a rectangle.<br/>
*Issue 2*: The Plane popup shows the object on plane &quot;Layer&quot;<br/>
 # Deselect and select the Rectangle and select it again<br/>
Now the Object Info palette shows the object correctly as a Rectangle<br/>
*Issue 3*: The Plane popup displays blank<br/>
 # Set the Plane popup to &quot;Top Component&quot;<br/>
*Issue 4*:  The Object Info palette shows correctly displays the selected object as a &quot;Rectangle&quot; but the palette is otherwise blank.<br/>
 # Select the Rectangle again<br/>
*Repeat of Issue 3*: The Plane popup displays blank<br/>
 # Set the Plane popup to &quot;Screen&quot;<br/>
All now works as expected.

<br/>
I have a customer who is creating own cable parts and saving them in the user library / workgroup library. These Parts doesn&#39;t show up in the &quot;Manage Cable part dialog&quot;.<br/>
 Is it a bug or is it a workflow question?<br/>
<br/>
Jesse Cogdell also tested it with this result: <br/>
&quot;I just ran some tests and it looks like the cable tools are set to only use the parts in the default libraries and the active file, this means that to access any cable needed from a workgroup or user library they need to first be imported into the active file and then the update command in the manage cable dialogue has to be triggered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you take a look? And if this is WAD, can you create a wish out of this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and best Regards<br/>

The same issue happens if the user chooses to not use the simple 3D parts display option. the parts of each leg will all be offset from the bridle apex point by the effective basket length.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be a purely visual problem, as when a bridle is calculated the Braceworks results display correctly<br/>
<br/>
image 1 shows the bridle with the simple 3D parts turned off and the show parts length on, as can be seen the 3D parts do not reach the apex<br/>
<br/>
image 2 show the same bridle with the use simple 3D display turned on and the show parts length also turned on<br/>
<br/>
image Leg 1 configuration shows the required leg length is 2481mm and the actual leg length is 2482mm<br/>
<br/>
image Leg 2 configuration shows the required leg length is 2803mm and the parts length is 2843mm<br/>
<br/>
I expected the show parts length to be slightly different from the  default use simple 3D parts view mode but the the difference seems much larger than it should be when the are only very small differences between the required leg length and leg parts length for each leg of the bridle (1mm and 40mm respectively)<br/>
<br/>
Although I am using 3D symbols for my bridle parts the behaviour is exactly the same using the standard 2D symbols<br/>
<br/>
to duplicate insert a truss or pipe, 2 house points with any basket defined except eyelet<br/>
<br/>
insert a bridle and then turn off the simple 3D parts option and turn on show parts length<br/>
<br/>
No matter how you edit the leg parts it will never display correctly

<br/>
as the table in this document shows, the calculation of braceworks doesn&#39;t really seem to be correct. <br/>
<br/>
It seems that Braceworks doesn&#39;t take care of the full length that affects the trussload.<br/>
<br/>
Can take a look at it?<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When the user wants to connect multiple consumers to the breakout, the distributor mode always assumes that the insertion route for the second and each subsequent cable is the same as the first, and will try to run directly from the first consumer to the second in a direct line (image 1). <br/>
<br/>
It gets  worse if the breakout is placed in the middle of a group of consumers and not at one end or the other (image 1b)<br/>
<br/>
The user can click on intermediate points, after the first consumer but then ends up with vertical doglegs in the cable path that will affect its length (see image 2)<br/>
<br/>
This will massively slow down the cable tools work flow as in most cases the user cannot take advantage of the sequential patching function to correctly insert the cables<br/>
<br/>
The way this should work is that each cable should behave the same as the first cable inserted, start point at the breakout and go to the consumer, without automatically inserting the cable running through any previous consumers (see image 3).

In the enclosed file perform a Braceworks calculation on all objects. Note that the Braceworks classes are then added to the document including the workload one.<br/>
If you then do an undo it seems nothing happens (that is the new Braceworks classes remain) until you do a third undo.<br/>
However even then once the &#39;Workload&#39; class is gone the (in this case) green workload objects remain. When selected they have no description in the OIP but are in the None class. If ungrouped as you can see in the movie there are a lot of objects.<br/>

<br/>
in this File we have three positions where two of them shows errors because of the virtual FEM.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a problem we can solve or if this is a bug because it works for the other two trusses.<br/>
<br/>
He tries to fix some cables to the truss for braceworks calculations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me out here.<br/>
<br/>
Best<br/>

I then duplicated that cable and colored it red.  I then used the split tool to create the specified cable breaks.  Each of the resulting cables should only contain one part, but each of them is made up of multiple parts.<br/>

<br/>
The trusses work fine in 2019 when the corner is placed first and then the straight truss connected second.  The left, right, and Bottom 3D connections are rotated properly and connecting to the corner.  If the straight is inserted first, the subsequent corner piece is rotated 180° from the straight piece.<br/>
<br/>
In VW2020 when the corner is inserted first and then the straight truss the left and right connections are correct but the bottom 3D is rotated 180° from the connection.  If the straight is inserted first the corner will connect and be rotated properly.  <br/>
<br/>
If the Truss Properties connection data is examined it is identical between both files.<br/>

Drawing cables over trusses really works great and the way is clearly visible. It would be nice, if all cables on their way are considered as weight on the truss. That means of course, if a cable falls from the truss to the ground, a point load of the weight of the length of the cable must be applied at this point. If I have jumps on other trusses, the weight must automatically be assigned to the truss, which is higher. I imagine it would be very difficult to program, but I would be really far ahead.<br/>
If this is generally not planned for 2021, the hacking should be deactivated at Load Information, Include in Calculation. Otherwise error messages will appear immediately.

<br/>
In 2020 I would be able to connect angle in 4 positions on a truss (up, down, left right). Now with 2021 there is only 2 ways with my angle : left or right.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 I can&#39;t do that simply if i want to keep my linear truss with 0° roll.<br/>
<br/>
I can do that only if I put 90° roll on my linear truss. Then angle can be connected up or down.<br/>
<br/>
I want to keep 0° roll on linear because my librairy have informations on 2D symbols (lenght, models, colors, ...)<br/>

The attached video shows how using Christie B-Type truss (spigot truss), working clock-wise is fine, but working counter-clockwise is incorrect. When working with Thomas 12x18 (bolted truss), every corner block I put in has a different orientation.<br/>

I always work with adjust flipped text turned off, because I want to decide the orientation.

<br/>
So I like to use the photo-image people symbols but I adjust the associated texture so it&#39;s a translucent white silhouette (you should think of making these standard, they look way better in illustrations) Anyway, when I change the class of these modified people the texture scale changes and I get giant legs. Very awkward indeed. Let me know if you can get the same results and why this happens.

In Vectorworks 2021 this only works when you select a single texture. As soon as you select more than one texture the menu item doesn&#39;t appear.<br/>
<br/>
This is quite detrimental, because extracting all images at once was a quick way to see what textures are too large and and bloating your file size. You could then downsample applicable images in Photoshop and re-import.<br/>

I assume this wasn&#39;t intentionally removed, but regardless it should be restored.<br/>

I assume this is a bug and not an inherent limit of the OBJ filetype, but let me know if that&#39;s incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching a VWX file that exhibits this problem upon export - I think it happens with all files but this one is a great example of how drastically this issue diminishes the quality of a model. Also attaching a couple screengrabs of the exported texture dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I can do differently to get a decent quality OBJ exported?

-Unzip attached file<br/>

-Using default settings, click OK (see attached image)<br/>

<br/>
A user has emailed in a video of the attributes default settings changing from by class back to normal settings when you go and edit a texture. <br/>
<br/>
This is really frustrating for the user&#39;s workflow and he has noticed this happening in the past few versions. <br/>
<br/>
I have tested this and this also happens on my machine. Also tested 2021 and the same happens.<br/>
<br/>
Please find attached the video. Let me know if you need anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks <br/>

<br/>
User is also experiencing issues in the visibility palette, which there are screen grab videos.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to see this in a team viewer session with the user, but I was am unable to replicate this issue on my PC, I only have one display.<br/>
<br/>
From the user<br/>
<br/>
In the movie the pallet moves to the right at around the 17 second mark. It moves right, off-screen at around the<br/>
<br/>
53 second mark. It also blinks partially out at the 21 second mark. Sometimes the, text inside the pallet redraws quite a lot during a render. Not sure if its related. But I notice it redrawing then leaving the screen. Sometimes the resource browser and attributes pallets will also disappear but not as often.<br/>
<br/>
The second problem is the viz pallet does not seem to always control the lights. I have attached a screen grab where the lights are off in the viz pallet and clearly not off in the render.<br/>

1. When insert &quot;-&quot; sign to IWidgetDataPopup in VW2019 and VW2020, it does not create a big dividing line as in previous versions.<br/>
2. When there are items with the same texts, GetChoiceByIndex() always get the first index of the same texts no matter which index you choose.<br/>

A lost story bound happens easily when walls are copied from one file to the other or there is a change in the file&#39;s story structure.<br/>

The file comes from VW 2019 but the issue is still valid in VW 2021.

<br/>
Nevertheless the situation is too complex, seen from the side of the user and something should be done to simplify it. We need these things to be in sync to work out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Wall Styles offer a Function field: Wall Style dialog, Data tab (screenshot 1)<br/>
 * The shipped worksheet template Wall Style Report from Defaults/Reports_Schedules offers a column for Function (screenshot 2), but this will return the wall style name in all cases, because implies that the IFC mapping is set to IfcWallStandardCase.ObjectType, which is not.<br/>
 * The out-of-the-box IFC mapping doesn&#39;t map the Function field at all (screenshot 3)<br/>
<br/>
Fixing this by setting <br/>
 * map Style.Function to IfcWallType.PredefinedType<br/>
 * fix the shipped worksheet templates<br/>
<br/>
is on my opinion necessary for allowing both<br/>
 * IFC mapping out of the box<br/>
 * Reporting out of the box<br/>
<br/>
All in all I pledge for a clearer concept for the Wall/Slab Data fields.

If I then change so the simpler geometry is at the bottom, the shadows reappear.<br/>
<br/>
For Landscape design, it is important not to have to create several different symbols for each tree, especially if working in BIM. You must be able to illustrate the same tree in several different ways, otherwise the whole &#39;draw it once&#39; and &#39;one model&#39; falls.<br/>
<br/>

There also seems to be an intermittent bug with the annotations - sometimes the polygon display works, sometimes not. Sometimes, if I close down the file, close VW and then reopen it, the settings have changed, both annotations and shadows.<br/>

 # Edit Section In-Place should show everything on the Design Layer from 2&#39; upwards<br/>
 # Edit Design Layer with &quot;Display with Clip Cube&quot; enabled should show everything on the Design Layer from 2&#39; upwards<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The file shown in the video is also attached for testing.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that while the HSVP Background Render shown in the video is OpenGL, this issue is present for other render modes as well (e.g., Hidden Line).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Putting a breakpoint in CutPlaneAndExtents::GetBelowCutPlaneElevation() would probably be a good starting point.

The attached video shows some of these issues and how they depend on the Cut Plane and Extents options selected for the HSVP. It is important to note that near the end of the video a Finite Depth of 6&#39; is attempted to be entered after a Finite Height of -4&#39; has been entered and we are told that &quot;The below cut plane depth cannot be higher than the cut plane&quot;, but this does not make sense in the case of a HSVP that should be looking upwards, not downwards.<br/>
<br/>
The attached file will open to the Sheet Layer shown in the attached video, but also contains Sheet Layers with HSVPs created using the menu command and from the top face of the Clip Cube for comparison.

To reproduce:<br/>
 # Open the attached VWX file<br/>

You will see 8 vertical section viewports (within the sheet border) created from an *unrotated* horizontal section viewport (outside the sheet border).<br/>

Notice the clip cube display in the design layer as expected.<br/>
 # Right-click on the clip cube face that&#39;s coincident with the cut plane and choose the &quot;Update Section Viewport&quot; context command.<br/>
 # Click the &quot;Return to Viewport&quot; button to return to the sheet layer.<br/>
 # Update the viewport<br/>
Notice the viewport updates with no visible change.<br/>
 # Edit the design layers of the same viewports using the &quot;Display with Clip Cube&quot; option.<br/>
Notice the clip cube display in the design layer as expected.<br/>
 # Go to Sheet Layer *3*<br/>
You will see 8 vertical section viewports (within the sheet border) created from a *rotated* horizontal section viewport (outside the sheet border).<br/>
 # Repeat steps 3 - 6<br/>
*Notice*, after step 6, the viewport visibly changes.<br/>
 # Edit the design layers of the same viewports using the &quot;Display with Clip Cube&quot; option.<br/>
*Notice* the clip cube display in the design layer is not as expected.

Editing a rotated HSVP using this workflow really makes the issue noticeable since the working plane&#39;s rotation also changes in addition to the shifting seen in the other cases.

It is important to note that the hatch fill that shifts is the 2D Fill version of the hatch and not the &#39;surface hatch&#39; version, which is in the correct position in final frame and during navigation. It may also be worth noting that the SVP&#39;s rotation does not appear to affect the direction of the shift relative to the symbol.

2. Go to the Design Layer and see that the Window has the shadow properly showing and everything looks correct.<br/>
<br/>
3. Now switch to the only Section Viewport that is in the file. Here we can see that the Glass is being shown on top of the Shadow, therefore cutting the Shadow display.<br/>
<br/>
When testing this with SP1, it was not possible to reproduce the problem, hence I am marking this as a Regression.<br/>
<br/>
Note: The lack of shadow transparency in the Section Viewport possible to be seen with Best Performance was reported as a separate issue.<br/>

                Fill Attributes work inconsistently for Auto Hybrids
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When you set the 2D Appearance settings of an Auto Hybrid to &quot;Use 2D Attributes of Contained Objects,&quot; you&#39;d expect the resulting Auto Hybrid to do just that. However, this appears to work inconsistently.<br/>
<br/>
See the attached file. Starting at the top, the example Auto Hybrid contains 7 Extrudes inside, each set to one of the Fill options in the Attributes Palette. No Fill, Solid, Pattern, and Hatch all work as expected. But Tile, Gradient, and Image do not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
From there I experimented more. The next Auto Hybrid is set to &quot;Use Class 2D Attributes&quot; instead of &quot;Use 2D Attributes of Contained Objects.&quot; First I tried a class set to a Gradient fill. This one was weird. It applied the gradient, but only to one of the extrudes, with the rest only getting the solid color at the respective end of the gradient spectrum. Even more odd is that the gradient seems to always map to the top-most extrude in the stacking order.<br/>
<br/>
This Auto Hybrid was set so that the extrudes are cut through.<br/>
<br/>
For the next Auto Hybrid, I switched the settings so that the extrudes were below the cut plane, which made it map the gradient to just a small sliver of the top-most extrude. Very odd.<br/>
<br/>
Then I tried using classes set to Tile and Image fills. Funny enough, these Auto Hybrids worked exactly as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Then I tried cutting through the extrudes with a Section Viewport to see if that provided any useful insights. The Section Viewport is set to &quot;Use Attributes of Original Objects.&quot; Here, all the fill types worked, except for the Gradient one only shows one color instead of the entire gradient.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Clearly there&#39;s lots of inconsistency and unexpected results in all of this. From my perspective, if some of the fill types simply didn&#39;t work, and did so in a consistent way, I&#39;d understand it as some sort of built-in limitation. But the ways in which they don&#39;t work are so inconsistent that I have to assume it&#39;s a web of bugs.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Go to a Top view<br/>
-Note the position of (0,0) in the ruler bar<br/>
-Now double-click the Callout to edit it<br/>

Note that the ruler bar shifts so that it shows (0,0) at the internal origin.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open a blank file<br/>
-Right-click in the References tab of the Nav palette and choose &quot;New&quot;<br/>
-Select the attached DWG<br/>
-In the Import dialog, choose &quot;Use detected DXF/DWG file units&quot; and set the Unitless option to anything other than Millimeters<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Referenced DWG object is just a few inches/cm wide initially.<br/>
<br/>
-Now update the reference <br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Referenced DWG gets many times larger.<br/>
<br/>
If the Unitless option is set to Millimeters the problem won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
If you import/reference the DWG using the File/Import command instead of the Nav Palette, the unitless menu remains grayed and you&#39;re forced to enter specified units. In that case the size change won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2019 when the Unitless option was introduced.

2) In the select video input dialog, select an NDI stream and make sure it is set to low bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
3) Create a crop, the issue is most noticeable if you create a fairly small crop in the bottom right corner, like 10-20% of the source stream. At this point, the crop appears to be correct.<br/>
<br/>
4) Click on the NDI stream the crop was made from and change it to high bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
5) Click on the crop. At this point the crop has changed position.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I was testing things related to the issue found recently with a webcam in use by another program, making it&#39;s content inaccessible. Currently when this happens the input still shows up in the video input dialog even though when you click on it there isn&#39;t any content to display. This itself isn&#39;t a problem unless we want to hide it for UX reasons. Assigning a video input from the list that is in use in another program just gets you a black surface, and you can reset the input without issue.<br/>
<br/>
The problem comes when you make a crop of one of these invalid inputs. The crop can be created and applied to a mesh just fine, which results in a black surface like you&#39;d expect, but it crashes if you then try to reset the input.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably a few things that should be fixed here.<br/>
<br/>
First, we shouldn&#39;t crash if we somehow have bad content assigned when resetting whether a crop or otherwise, however we manage to get into such a situation (not sure if this is the only way).<br/>
<br/>
Second, we probably shouldn&#39;t allow an empty crop to be created.<br/>
<br/>
Third and lowest priority/importance, we might want to hide inputs from the list if they don&#39;t carry any content. This is something I see some programs (like zoom) doing to make the interface a bit cleaner which is always nice.

It&#39;s not possible to import the attached file. I closed Vectorworks after waiting several minutes and the progress bar looks like freezed.<br/>

In Vectorworks 2019 the import works fine.<br/>

<br/>
W 300, H 300, D 300<br/>
<br/>
In these cases the Make / Model should be researched online and the true dimensions from the manufacturers spec sheet should be entered.<br/>
<br/>
Also device specifications for rack-mounting items need review. Full rack-mount width is 482.6mm but in some records it is clear that these have been rounded to 482 or 483. Another clue as to whether a device is rack-mounted is the height which should be an integer multiple of 44.45mm. Again we see quite a few instances of rounding up or down.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s needed in these cases is a review of the actual manufacturers spec to find out if the device is rack-mounted or not. If it is, then the dimensions in our database should be modified to correct rack-width spec, and the height be set to 44.45 x the number of rack U. This way the device builder will correctly created a rack-mounted device.<br/>
<br/>
It is appreciated that the curation done last year was under considerable time pressure. Much was achieved but we now need to schedule a further clean-up.

I&#39;ve got a Customer file with a Data Visualization. In Vectorworks marks the Data Visualization all Objekts with the connected Record, also Objects their in a group or in a symbol. The groups and the symbols aren&#39;t connect with the same Record. When I export the file as dwg, it&#39;s only override the objects there aren&#39;t in a group or in a symbol.<br/>
When it shows the Data Visualization correctly in Vectorworks, why omitted the override the export the groups and symbols?<br/>

<br/>
​One of our clients faces issues with the export of his sheet layer to the model space in a DWG:<br/>
- VW crashes when &quot;export tile fills&quot; is enabled.<br/>
- When &quot;export tile fills&quot; is disabled, the walls in the top/plan viewports or not or just partly exported.<br/>
<br/>
After a few tests by myself, I discovered the following issues in exporting his document:<br/>
- VW crashes indeed on the export of tile fills. I experienced trouble with tiles and DWG before. Are there any known bugs on this?<br/>
- One of his top/plan viewport contains a roof object in a grayed layer. If I disable this grayed layer, some more objects appear as if the roof (which does have a solid fill) was covering them. is it known that DWG cannot handle grayed objects very well? do you think it works as designed?<br/>
- The strangest thing: If I want the walls to appear in the exported file, I need to first enter the design layer of each top/plan viewport by dubble clicking on the and exit again. The export following this operation is correct (exept from the missing tile fills). This is the second time I see this problem since the release of SP3. Did you encounter this issue before?<br/>
<br/>
I added the document, the exported DWG&#39;s and a video of the problem in the wetransfer-link:<br/>

Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
The first and last issues do sound like they are bugs. There might be something specific in their file that is causing this, because they aren&#39;t issues that I have seen before. The second issue seems like it is a limitation of DWG files in AutoCAD and is probably Works As Designed. Can you submit the file on JIRA so that engineering can take a look?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

The Wall is on the detail level &quot;low&quot; and is black in VW and in level &quot;middle and high&quot; it has a hatch. When I check the export with an viewer, then I see the hatches not the black attributes form the Detail level &quot;low&quot;. <br/>

&quot;The customer has a measurement of a laser measuring device. He exported this as a dxf in Rhino. If he imports that into VW everything looks fine, the individual images are arranged orthogonally in 3D. If he makes the dxf export out of VW with the same output data as in Rhino, all images are superimposed. When re-importing into VW, I then have 6344 superimposed pictures with which you can start very little. It looks strongly as if something goes wrong with the export from VW.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Attached is the VW file with the name &quot;Fehler Export.vwx&quot;. I did exported this file to dxf / dwg and then imported back to VW, what is returned is a flattened image that I can&#39;t recognize when trying to compare with the original &quot;Fehler Export.vwx&quot; file.<br/>
<br/>
Attached I leave a screenshot of how its seen in the original vwx and how it is displayed after Re-Importing the dxf / dwg. I used the Standard Settings, but I did changed from millimeters to meters (although millimeters was the detected measure), because I wasn&#39;t hable to rotate or zoom the file when in millimiters, too heavy.

<br/>
When HC space is is part of an angled set of spaces the dimensions are wrong. I have a feeling that this is due to the programming depending on the horizontal dimension of the &quot;aisle width&quot; parameter without consideration for the width perpendicular to the lane markers.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, this is very poorly implemented and causes much frustration...

In the enclosed file there is a path hardscape object with two gentle curves. Note that with the Joint pattern &#39;Paver Curved Path&#39;, there are long lines in black at the start and end of each curve. This ruins the look of the pavers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it makes for a bad user experience that like other hardscapeas the origin handle is visible when the hardscape is selected yet when dragged around, unlike the other hardscape types, nothing happens to the origin of the pattern. At the very least it might be made invisible.<br/>
<br/>

Please see this thread on the forum:<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/69671-assign-class-to-a-plant/<br/>
<br/>
This is one of our users who I have been trying to help and suggested he post to the forum. [~frank] was very helpful in suggesting the user save the Plant as a Red Symbol and to choose that it is placed in it&#39;s preferred class when creating the red symbol. However this doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
 It only works if the object is a black symbol (ie the &#39;Convert to PIO&#39; is unchecked. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Also, when using some vwx-files as X-ref in other vwx-files, they have sometimes moved, using internal origin instead of user origin.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to change user-origin to fit internal origin as this is project-zero for everyone in those projects (BIM). It must also be possible to change coordinates in user-origin to global coordinates used in project for exact geo-positioning.<br/>
<br/>
In vwx it is not possible to set internal origin, so we can not move it to user origin. Suppose it is a bug. When update a x-ref it jumps to correct position, but then, maybe a week or some days later, it has moved and must be updated again...<br/>
<br/>
Just to explain our problem, attached is a screendump of a coordination point for one of our BIM-projects, &quot;project zero&quot;, unit here is mm. This project has in all 12 buildings, 6-17 floors.... Referenced files can come in both project0 and NTM-coordinates, exports are requested both in project0 from consultants and NTM-coordinates from construction companies.

<br/>
# In a new blank document, draw a hardscape with default settings. This will create the default hardscape classes. <br/>
# Edit the newly created Site-Hardscape Comp-Spec and allocate a distinctive text style to that class that is different from the document&#39;s default text settings. Also set the text style to use at creation.<br/>
# Select the hardscape tool, click the Preferences button in the toolbar, and set it to create tags. <br/>
# Draw another hardscape and note the tag is not using the designated class text style. Also note that if the hardscape style is saved by clicking the Save Hardscape button in the OIP, none of the tag settings are saved.<br/>

I can&#39;t find a way to make the Attribute mapping tool work on the hardscape&#39;s border in this case.<br/>
<br/>
(In general, the attribute mapping tool&#39;s behavior on the hardscape seems unstable - during my testing there was a case when the attribute mapping tool didn&#39;t show the rectangle control points but after restarting VW I was not able to reproduce it anymore).<br/>
<br/>
Do the following steps:<br/>
- delete the user folder cache (not sure whether it is necessary...).<br/>
- launch VW and open the test file<br/>
- change to Top plan and render in openGL<br/>
- select the Hardscape object<br/>
- activate the Attribute Mapping tool<br/>
- the Part popup in the tool bar doesn&#39;t list the border (the only listed choices are &quot;Main Slab texture&quot; and &quot;Overall&quot;).<br/>

There are two NURBS surfaces (Named &quot;test&quot; and &quot;test2&quot;) in the document. Currently, the simple surface (test2) is set as the criteria in the Obj by Crit node and the network works well.<br/>
<br/>
Setting the Node to reference the second surface (test) returns nothing.<br/>

As a user I don&#39;t know why this may be happening so I am not sure if this is a limitation with the type of surface or a bug with the &quot;Point on Surface&quot; node.<br/>

Maybe the description should be changed (if the node works ok).

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the BIMObject tool and open the browser<br/>
-Type in a search query (you can either wait until the page finishes loading or do it immediately)<br/>
<br/>
Note that this causes the &quot;Allow access&quot; page to appear, and when you return to the main page the search is lost and must be re-typed.<br/>
<br/>
-Now download and insert the BIMObject<br/>
-Launch the browser and search again<br/>
<br/>
Note that the &quot;Allow access&quot; page shows again, even though the &quot;Remember my choice&quot; checkbox was enabled the previous time.

 The Engineering Properties of the object that executed Clip Surface has unintended values.<br/>
  <br/>
 Example of reproduction:<br/>
 1. Draw two concentric circles. The Section Properties of each circle have the same value on the X and Y axes.<br/>
 2. Select two concentric circles and execute &quot;Clip Surface&quot;.<br/>
 3. Select the generated donut-shaped Polyline and execute &quot;Engineering Properties&quot;.<br/>
 4. Checking the section properties in the engineering properties dialog box, the values are different for the x and y axes. (Engineering Properties_1.png)<br/>
  <br/>
 Why are different values on the X and Y axes?<br/>
<br/>
In the following steps, Section Properties will approach the intended value.<br/>
  <br/>
 5. Select the donut-shaped Polyline and execute &quot;Convert to Polygons&quot;.<br/>
 6. If you select two separated Polygons and execute &quot;Add Surface&quot;, it becomes a donut-shaped Polyline again.<br/>
 7. Select the donut-shaped Polyline and execute &quot;Engineering Properties&quot;.<br/>
 8. Section Properties of Engineering Properties X axis and Y axis are changed to almost the same value. (Engineering Properties_2.png)<br/>

Testfile and export are in the attachments.<br/>

                SBE: Problems with clip cube / convert to mesh

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      For some reason, the clip cube paints the 3D polygon of the last step of the stair in the test file in red (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
There doesn&#39;t seem to be anything wrong with the 3D polygon. There are no polygons at the same location as you can check in testfile &quot;stair converted into polygons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is also strange that the clip cube doesn&#39;t paint the polygon in red while it is still a 3D polygon in a group, but paints it red once the group has been converted into a mesh.<br/>
<br/>
I attached three testfiles:<br/>
<br/>
- stair with 3d polygons.vwx: stair using a hidden test setting that skips the conversion of 3D polygon groups into meshes. Here the clip cube looks OK<br/>
<br/>
- stair with mesh.vwx: same stair, but using normal settings, i.e. groups of 3D polygons are converted into meshes. Here, the clip cube paints the polygon red despite the mesh is based on the same 3D polygons as in the prevous testfile.<br/>
<br/>
- stair converted into polygons.vwx: Same as stair with 3d polygons.vwx, but ungrouped so you can see that there are no coplanar or identical polygons at the position of the &quot;red&quot; polygon.<br/>
<br/>
This is very weird. Imho either GroupToMesh creates an incorrect mesh from correct 3D polygons, or the clip cube algorithm is not working correctly and draws the polygon in red although it is OK.<br/>
<br/>
This bug is (at least partly) the cause for VB-168740.

It also includes a Section Viewport that displays the components.<br/>

To reproduce, open the file in each version and update the SVP.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the border&#39;s blue section fill fails to show in 2021.<br/>

If you edit the Hardscape&#39;s border attributes and change the Section Pen to by-class, the border fill will then show in the SVP again.<br/>

4. Move it back to the origin<br/>
5. Export as IFC<br/>
6. Open the IFC file<br/>
Result is the Test.ifc file. If an object is created too far from origin, even after moving it back to the origin before exporting, the export retains the &quot;too far from origin&quot; graphical problem. We already had a couple of Customers complaining about this problem.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that if the object is moved to the origin and then we can again see it being correctly displayed, then it should be also correctly displayed after the export, which isn&#39;t the case.<br/>
<br/>
With Test 2.vwx this does not happen, because the object was created in the origin.

I inserted walls into a symbol and distributed them on different design levels. Then export as an ifc project (version 4) and check it in BIMCollab. The different symbols placed were moved to the same level and to the VW origin. In ifc (Version 2.3) the positions are correct.<br/>

<br/>
In VW2018 attach your own record format to a wall, map it in the Ifc Data Manager, change in object info Data Pane a value = it is directly mapped to the Pset (very easy!).<br/>
<br/>
Open this file in 2019,2020, 2021. The attached record format is preserved but the value in the custom Pset is gone. Add the record format again in the &quot;new&quot; Data Manager, define the mapping. The values of the VW Data Sets are nor corresponding with the Ifc Data Sets. I found no way to use the record format as a source and map it to another custom Pset. In the record format it is very comfortable to work with popup field. No I have to fill the Ifc custom Pset manually. In 2018 it so much easier to work with own Psets and mapping them into the Ifs custom Pset. see Movie and files.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I missed something, but if I&#39;m right, this means a great regression. <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>

- center mark tool sees both circles but only one circle is possible to get the center mark, see attached movie<br/>

- when using the radial dimension tool 9 out of 10 times it is not possible to dimension the circle because it is not &#39;seen&#39; by the tool. See movie where it was not possible to dimension the circles, yesterday i was able to do that, unclear why<br/>
<br/>
- Hovering above the circle does not make it recognize the circle. Sometimes you have to click somewhere else on the object (like cm&#39;s away of it) to get it to &#39;see&#39; the circle.<br/>
<br/>
- when using the radial dimension tool several times in a row/clicks it gets the beta 9 alert. <br/>
<br/>
attached 3 videos:<br/>
<br/>
* shows that is not possible to dimension two circles in the file, only one gets the center mark and radial dimension.<br/>
* one shows that you can dimension a circle by clicking cm`s away from the circle that is not even visible in on your screen<br/>

Is this a bug or by design?<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Go to Organization &gt; Classes Tab. Then select “None” and click “Edit”.<br/>
2) Check “Use at Creation” on Text Style and choose “Dimensions 10 pt” on the pulldown.<br/>
3) Click OK to close. Then select “Dimension” and click “Edit”.<br/>
4) Check “Use at Creation” on Text Style and choose “Dimensions 10 pt” on the pulldown.<br/>
5) Click OK.<br/>
6) Go to Page Setup &gt; Printer Setup. Then choose Vectorworks on the pulldown.<br/>
7) Change scaling from 100% to any value. (Ex. 50%)<br/>
8) Select the Text tool and enter any texts. The size will be 20 pt.<br/>
9) Select the Constrained Linear Dimension tool and draw with the Constrained Chain Mode.<br/>
10) The size of the dimension value will be 10 pt. But it will be 20 pt if you draw with the Constrained Linear Mode.<br/>

2. Copied the first customer Dimension Standard to create a second one, which is marked in the test file as Blue.<br/>

<br/>
We have a Viewport of a 3D Object, with which we use a Projection Orthogonal and Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Like it is shown in the video, we insert Dimensions in the Annotations of the Viewport, when in Projection Orthogonal or Perspective. The Dimensions shown are of the Projection and not of the object real size. <br/>
<br/>
We believe that the Dimensions should not be influenced by the type of Projection used, but that Dimensions should always show the real size of the object, independent of how it is displayed.

Added a Class called &quot;Opacity&quot; that does not exhibit the same behavior as the Dimension class. <br/>

While not typical work flow, we do occasionally include dimensions on a tenant plan during the schematic phase. We will change the dimension class to a lighter color so that the dimensions do not stand out and become a prominent feature of the drawings.

Hiragino Mincho Pro W3<br/>
Hiragino Mincho Pro W6<br/>
*We have actually confirmed the above fonts, but there may be other fonts that are experiencing this phenomenon.<br/>
 <br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
We have confirmed that only &quot;Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro W3&quot; fonts are not converted to outlines, but can be edited as text on Adobe Illustrator.<br/>
However, depending on the specific character string entered, it was recorded as a different font in the EPSF file, and the path of the text was split.<br/>
<br/>
Although this font is a Japanese font, it is installed by default on macOS displaying Japanese, so I think it is possible to confirm the phenomenon on macOS displaying English.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the test file as well as a blank file<br/>
-Run the Update All Viewports command in the test file<br/>
-Immediately switch to the blank file<br/>
-After the renders complete, switch back to the test file<br/>
<br/>
Note that the RW viewports appear empty.<br/>
<br/>
You may also see a problem where the graphics for all the viewports become corrupted. I&#39;m looking at that bug separately.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2020.

Occurs in Mojave, Catalina, and Big Sur. It does not occur on Sierra and High Sierra.<br/>
[Reproduction example]<br/>
1) Start Vectorworks Package Manager.<br/>
2) Select &quot;Direct Install&quot;&gt; &quot;Install a Local Package ...&quot; from the Vectorworks Package Manager menu.<br/>
3) Select three files in the file selection dialog and click &quot;Open&quot;.<br/>
4) &quot;Instaling Package 1/3&quot; is displayed in the &quot;Install a Local Package&quot; dialog.<br/>
5) After that, the progress bar display and the file count are not updated, and after waiting for a while, it suddenly switches to &quot;Installation Complete&quot;. * This problem does not occur on Sierra and High Sierra.<br/>
6) Next, select and install the two files, and the &quot;Install a Local Package&quot; dialog will display &quot;Instaling Package 3/3&quot;. The correct display should be 1/2. * This problem also does not occur on Sierra and High Sierra.<br/>

Target environment<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Win Mac<br/>
It occurs in v2020.<br/>
The past versions are the same as well.<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
How to Reproduce<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
If there is a space figure, [Section Viewport] switches to the unupdated state when printed.<br/>
<br/>
1)Create any Extrude.<br/>
2)Create any Space.<br/>
3)Create a Section Viewport.<br/>
4)Click File menu &gt; Print<br/>
5)Check [Reset all plug-in objects that require a reset prior to printing] and print it.<br/>
6)The [Section Viewport] switches to the unupdated state when printed.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
-When [Reset all plug-in objects that require a reset prior to printing] is unchecked, it does not occur.<br/>
-It seems to occur every time, so I think it needs improvement.<br/>
-It does not happen with [Export Image File] and [Export PDF] with similar settings.<br/>

But when you edit a class in the navigation using the pencil edit it lets you carrying on typing (does not update class however). when you do the same in the organization aplatte with the pencil again it lets you type more than 63 characters but doesn&#39;t take effect.<br/>
<br/>
When you edit using the edit button in the organization it doesnt let you type more than 63 characters.<br/>
<br/>
So there is a lot of inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
Another worry with this is *if a user adds more characters to the beginning of the class name it takes characters off the end of the name which could cause issues further down the line<br/>

A very limited number of frame rates are supported, namely 24, 25, 30, 50, and 60 (24, 30, and 60 can be NTSC). It was not designed to handle high resolutions, the maximum supported is 4095x4095. The compression is poor and a very high data rate is needed to maintain decent visual quality leading to large file sizes. The maximum data rate is capped at a value that is not high enough to maintain decent visual quality for the resolutions and frame rates we support.

The enclosed file will open on a rendered viewport. If you change a setting in the Background Render Settings in the OIP and then re-render, you&#39;ll notice that only one layer is rendered. In order to get it to render all layers you have to set it back to wireframe then back to Custom Renderworks and it will render correctly.<br/>
This is true for sheets 13-17.<br/>

Just had a user call up asking about how to create a Seating Section. They had gone to the Vectorworks University and looked at the movie where the instructions are to use the Event Design menu&gt;Seating Section command. This command no longer exists as it is now a tool in the Event Design tool set, with lots of different options. <br/>
<br/>
it must be very difficult to maintain all these movies as the software evolves but this is a fundamental part of how to use the Seating Section yet the user still couldn&#39;t understand how to create one by in the first place by watching the movie, hence this report. I had to tell him.<br/>

The sheet layer viewport has a design layer viewport that is referenced from another file. Depending on the Navigation Graphics it will or will not be seen in the sheet layer viewport.<br/>

However no matter what the settings are the referenced objects do not print or PDF even when rastorised nor even exporting to Image file does it comes through. As well the Lighting devices also show the usually not seen Renderworks lights. Movie encloded.<br/>

If you try any of the preset Solstices and Equinoxes they default to the first in the list - Dec 22.  This is not what would be expected obviously.<br/>

It is a very common/universal workflow to select more than one heliodon but with different times of day and change the month for sun studies (which are very detailed and compulsory here in Australia). <br/>

In the enclosed file there&#39;s a data tag it should open on. When editing, the screen has to be refreshed each time to see something moved. There are no selection handles on the rounded rectangles but of course if I go back onto the drawing or in another file the selection handles are there. It makes editing the Data Tags very difficult.<br/>
I have changed the Navigation Graphics but it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything. Movie enclosed (sorry about background noise).<br/>
<br/>
However after I quit and relaunched it works as expected so this is really only flagging an intermittent issue.<br/>

A worksheet might contain many database rows. Unfortunately if users want to lose all the lines, they are unable to even if all the cells are selected.<br/>

The workaround is to select each database row at a time and do it that way. No matter what the lines return in the formatting dialogue as grey which have to be set to &#39;none&#39; again.<br/>

The enclose file has a sheet called &#39;01 -0001 Node Detail&#39;. There are several viewports all showing one design layer called &#39;Node Design 3&#39;. <br/>
The objects are simple extrudes and there doesn&#39;t seem anything awry with the file in terms of internal origin for example. The file started in v2018.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is when exporting to PDF often but not always the model in the viewports do not esport. Only the annotations come through.<br/>
<br/>
However in my testing there have been inconsistent results. Mostly the viewports look fine in Vectorworks but do not export. Yet looking at the enclosed movie you can see that one update having opened with v2021 does not draw at all and remains invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I was able to export to PDF with no problem. If I changed the settings such as from custom Renderworks settings low to FQRW then the export to PDF wouldn&#39;t render the model.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it worked in v2021 sometimes not. The enclosed movies happen directly after a reboot of the machine. Currently in v2021 the export to PDF doesn&#39;t work for Renderworks renders. OpenGL is fine which is what we have told the user to use.<br/>

These objects were made in an older version of Vectorworks and modified in 2020. Prior to the steps taken below I could render and export to PDF and the model would show. The customer rendered in Vectorworks sheet layers fine it was only when he viewed the PDF that he noticed the model wasn&#39;t there, only the annotations.<br/>
<br/>
So using layer object import I have rebuilt the file totally in a blank 2020 file.<br/>
The problem now is that for me, only the annotations are visible once the model is rendered in any Renderworks types in the viewport!<br/>
<br/>
OpenGL is fine as you can see on the duplicated viewports next to the original on the sheet layers.<br/>
<br/>
So my issue on the Mac is now worse than it was before I rebuilt but I enclose the file. BTW it works fine in 2021.<br/>

When imported using Method A (screenshot of import dialogue enclosed - 3D model and meshes) the resulting Vectorworks file is 5.8MB and the objects appear to have converted although walls seem to go through the roof which is common.<br/>
<br/>
When imported again in Method B (this time as Vectorworks Solid Objects and 2D and 3D views) it takes a long time to convert. When eventually it does you&#39;ll see a lot of failed Revit Entities. The file size is also 81.2MB much larger than the other method.<br/>

The enclosed file and movie will explain better but in a nutshell:<br/>
<br/>
* A symbol has a 2D component for it&#39;s right and left side for sections.<br/>
* The symbol is on the page and mirrored and duplicated.<br/>
* When a section viewport is created using the default &#39;View as Cut when Cut in viewport&#39; the mirrored symbol shows the 2D component as flipped (ie original orientation) when in Hidden Line (HLR).<br/>
* If the Vertical cut Plane is set to &#39;Uncut Below/beyond cut in viewport&#39; the orientation is correct.<br/>
 <br/>
This most likely is due to something about the 2D component as that wouldn&#39;t be showing with the second option. So this is most likely nothing to do with HLR rather the 2D symbol component (which seems ok to me).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The enclosed file is a working demonstration file I am building as a Spotlight template for Australian users in v2021. Trying to sort out some classes (Cable ones) you can see in the movie that when trying to use the scroll bar in the Organisation Dialogue that it becomes very difficult to navigate the list by scrolling. <br/>
<br/>
The list isn&#39;t that long (I think about 85 classes) but it makes using the organisation dialogue very tricky. Often there are long delays of 2-3 seconds or longer and you can see even trying to close the dialogue you get a misleading impression.<br/>
<br/>
This happens repeatedly even after a restart of the machine. It might work ok briefly at the start then soon after another go slows down and becomes sticky again.<br/>

This file is large because a prospective client wanted to use 3D geometry as opposed to Image props for the plants. This is so he doesn&#39;t have to add them in Enscape.<br/>
<br/>
However as you can see in the movie the Animation path frequently either doesn&#39;t show anything or ends up as if it is playing and the only option in the OIP is &#39;pause&#39;. The only way to progress is to quit and relaunch.<br/>
Sometimes as can be seen in the movie reshaping the path will trick it into thinking it is playing and again Pause it the only option, so another relaunch.<br/>
This file also when activating the camera often, not always, the view would remain either in Top Plan or it would be blank. A select all would show the outline of the objects but they would not be visible.<br/>
I have edited out the waiting bits to speed it up a bit. As you can see I have restarted the computer, relaunched and within 6 minutes I have to relaunch.<br/>

                Solid Subtraction with round Extrusions result in inaccurate 2D line rendering

But when doing solid subtractions that include at least one rounded extrusion, the resulting 2D line rendering is pretty wonky.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce (see the video and screenshots):<br/>
1) open the attached file in 25.0.5 or 26.0.2<br/>
2) select two intersecting extrusions (one of which should be rounded)<br/>
3) right-click &gt; select &quot;Subtract Solids...&quot; and confirm &quot;OK&quot;<br/>
--&gt; You will see, that the edges show up where they shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
Even before the solid subtraction, the rounded extrusions already don&#39;t render the 2D edges correctly, but it&#39;s only after the solid subtraction that it becomes very obvious.

notice the point cloud looks wrong when not flying<br/>
<br/>
the problem is that Unified View gets stuck ON when deleting the layers.  Maybe a mismatch Save/Restore UnifiedView somewhere in the delete code. <br/>
<br/>
when unified view is off, the point cloud is drawn by Core on static frame which looks wrong.  That is fine because Unified View is not a workflow we are fixing bugs for.<br/>

Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a 3D model and a complex Point Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Go to any 3D view<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Point Cloud shows correctly at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now delete all the design layers except for the &quot;Point Cloud&quot; layer<br/>
 -Make the &quot;Point Cloud&quot; layer active and zoom<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Point Cloud now appears flat in static views.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

                STEP File Import - Differing Results and Hard to Work With

</td>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Videocom has a customer that received two STEP files from a third party. The files were created in CATIA, and they were apparently generated and sent out of CATIA the same exact way. They are slightly different shapes/models though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One file is providing a generic solid while the other file is providing ~6,000 NURBS surfaces once it gets into Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that this is because the NURBS surfaces model has at least one hole/break somewhere in the geometry; however, I can’t come up with any way of confirming this in Vectorworks other than the attached error message we get when trying to ‘stitch and trim surfaces’ on all of them. I have tried the file in smaller batches with some success, but this would take hours or days to manually narrow down the individual connections.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there any way for someone to confirm this model is correct/solid in CATIA or another application so we can rule out if this is an import bug into Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(If this is Working as Designed, I will be submitting a VE for a better way for detecting holes/issues like this in Vectorworks.)

<br/>
3. When executing the “Create Section Viewport” command menu to object, part of the object below the cylindrical object is not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
4. However, the object is displayed only in the “Dashed Hidden Line” of the rendering settings.<br/>
<br/>
5. By setting &quot;Hidden Object Display&quot; in the rendering settings other than the “Dashed Hidden Line” rendering, the object below that was not displayed is displayed.<br/>

-Open test file <br/>
<br/>
-In the OIP, open the &#39;Cut Plane and Extents&#39; dialog then change the Height from &quot;Story - 1&quot; to &quot;Story - 2&quot; then close the dialog<br/>
<br/>
-Update the section<br/>
<br/>
-Note it is desired to have a progress bar on the bottom right of document window for feedback. This issue gets worse if you enable &quot;Display 2D Fills&quot; option from the OIP and update the section viewport. The user has no feedback as to when the section will finish updating.

I&#39;ve attached a movie and test file that show this. The file contains several sets of Walls, and a variety of different object types that are placed at roughly a 10&#39; elevation and assigned to the &quot;Test&quot; class. The file also contains two Horizontal SVPs with a 4&#39;0&quot; cut plane that are set to show the &quot;Test&quot; class in the above-plane display. The viewport on the left uses custom attributes and the viewport on the right uses the objects&#39; original attributes.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, update both viewports.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the viewport on the left (with custom attributes) shows all of the objects, while the viewport on the right (with original attributes) fails to show the Symbol, Auto Hybrid, and Structural Members.<br/>

<br/>
This Viewports and Section Viewports are rendered in OpenGL and Hidden Line.<br/>
<br/>
With OpenGL we can see that color is shown in both Viewports and Section Viewports.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when looking at the same Viewports and Section Viewports but with Render Hidden Line Mode, it is everything black and white, no color whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed that with 2019, the Section Viewports of OpenGL were without color, but now with 2020 already shows color.<br/>
<br/>
This leaves me the question... if the situation with Hidden Line is a limitation of Section Viewports and color is simply not supported or is this actually a Bug?<br/>
<br/>
If this is WAD and a limitation, can we please switch this from VB to VE?<br/>
<br/>

3. Double Click the Section Viewport<br/>
3.1. Select Section-In-Place and press Ok<br/>
3.2. Now we can see how the object really looks like (Two.png).<br/>
<br/>
Compare the two attached screenshots and its visible that the Section Viewport is not showing the objects NURBS completely.

<br/>
We have a company that works for Starbucks who is having some issues with viewports not rendering in Hidden line. <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t seem to find what the issue is. It seems to be only when in the file as we import the layers of the file into a new one and all seems to be ok. <br/>
<br/>
We have tried going through each layer one by one to see if it&#39;s a certain object causing the issue. No luck <br/>
<br/>
Tried exporting back to 2019 and still has problems with the hidden line render.<br/>
<br/>
Sheet in questions is A2002-Exterior Elevations<br/>
<br/>
The two viewports on this sheet won&#39;t render in hidden line.<br/>
<br/>
Could you take a look and see if you have any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen<br/>

<br/>
In the attached file you can see that there is missing a line, which should be visible. Because of the conversion from 3D to 2D the line was generated as a Polyline.<br/>
<br/>
If you copy the symbol to a empty file and create a elevation the line is there...<br/>
<br/>
Because we rework so many (older) Symbol libraries it would be very helpful if we could rely on the elevations we generate in the library documents to review our works.<br/>

<br/>
When opening the attached .vwx file we can see a Section Viewport that has Windows on both sides of the building. This Windows are misplaced from the expected position, being displayed in a lower position than it should.<br/>
<br/>
This happens with Background Render: Hidden Line and the Polygon variants. Does not happen with OpenGL or Renderworks.<br/>
<br/>
Changing Navigation Graphics does not affect anything.<br/>
<br/>
If we switch to the Design Layer and in 3D view we can see that all windows are positioned correctly as they should, including with Hidden Line. This misplacement only happens in the Section Viewport.<br/>

But, it exists on the OIP of sheet layer section viewports. Why?<br/>
(We confirmed it works if enabling and disabling on a sheet layer section viewport.)<br/>

2) Texts and dimensions which are placed above the cut plane don’t show even enabling the option. Is this a bug or by design?<br/>

Also the same problem occurs if you create a section viewport from &#39;Design Layer-1&#39;<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains several walls that have their overall pen thickness set to 0.50.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Render in Wireframe<br/>
<br/>
Note that all of the walls show the 0.50 thickness, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now render in Hidden Line, then do a few flyovers so the Interactive Hidden Line shows<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Interactive Hidden Line also shows the 0.50 pen thickness, but the regular Hidden Line doesn&#39;t (see attached screenshots).<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the only way to get the thicker lines to show is by editing the wall components and changing the pen thickness there. This can be really tedious though.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the pen thickness would remain consistent across these three render modes (Wireframe, Interactive Hidden Line, and Hidden Line).<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in previous versions.

I suspect it might be to do with the Section Line being created by duplicating an existing Section Viewport, generating a Section Line Instance, and then going and rotating (and moving) that Section Line Instance. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having other problems with Section Viewports created in this way, and it might have something to do with VB-167562<br/>

The file contains a few Truss objects that are placed at roughly a 10&#39; elevation and assigned to a custom class. The file also contains a Horizontal SVP with a 4&#39;0&quot; cut plane elevation that&#39;s set to show the custom class in the above-plane display. There&#39;s also an Extrude placed between the cut plane and the Truss objects, making them &quot;hidden objects&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in VW 2019 and 2020 and update the SVP in each version.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Truss objects show in 2019 but not in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen with all object types, so there seems to be something about Trusses that&#39;s causing the failure.<br/>

The same thing happens going back to SP0.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in each version and select the Group in a Front view.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2019, note that the highlighting matches the rotation of the resize handles (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020, note that the highlighting is rotated at an odd angle (see second screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the Group contains objects on a 3D plane. If they&#39;re on the Screen or Layer planes the highlighting shows fine.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens with &quot;Best Performance&quot; Nav Graphics.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2020 SP0. This also happens in VW 2021.

It would be fab to be able to know what will work on and what will not - at the moment it is a bit of a hit or miss situation.<br/>

In some situations, the settings from the original attributes (e.g. enlarged size or rotation) seem to bleed through to the override, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
The disabled tools are a plugin-specific case that I chose as an example (I think they are disabled using WorkspacePaletteUpdate(...,true,...) - as that plugin profile group works with custom palettes).<br/>
<br/>
There may be also other plugin-specific issues of sharing global visibilities/constraints/states in different view panes.<br/>
Not sure if it is possible to track those states and set / revert them based on the active pane.<br/>
<br/>
If this cannot be fixed globally, feel free to close the issue or reassign it for plugin-specific solution.

 1. When you open the sample file “12288.vwx”, the viewport with “Crop Visible” Off is displayed on the sheet layer.<br/>
 2. As a result of printing from the Print menu of Vectorworks, the frame of Crop is printed.<br/>
  <br/>
 [Print from Adobe Acrobat Reader]<br/>
 1. Open the sample file &quot;12288.vwx&quot; and execute Export PDF with the default settings.<br/>
 2. Open the created PDF file with Abobe Acrobat Reader and print it, and the Crop frame will be printed.<br/>

At first turning it off worked - now it seems i have to turn it on and then turn it off for my viewport to remain static. <br/>

Perhaps you can pinpoint why it&#39;s happening. Try and duplicate an existing viewport - make a change and update the viewport.

<br/>
Attached to this report is a video demonstrating how to reproduce, a simple Vectorworks 2020 file that was used in the video, and the WinDoor PIO. Note that the issue does not occur if the WinDoor PIO is *not* installed.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this is a fairly critical issue for our users, who are suddenly finding their models have some or all doors and windows at the internal origin.<br/>

Answer Tech Support:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have not seen that before.<br/>
<br/>
I see that if I move the walls around they will alway send the lines to center. I found copying the walls into a new file also produces this issue. I found though that drawing two new walls of the same types and connecting them does not produce the issue.<br/>

Please submit this with your video to JIRA.<br/>

In the example shown, the wall height is changed and you will see that the embedded Wall Recess feature does not redraw correctly. The user has to manually select the feature and force a regeneration, by double clicking to edit it. Note this is a Top/Plan redraw issue, the 3d view regens as expected.

<br/>
Users seem to expect that when placing a window in such an arrangement, the window wouldn&#39;t be able to go past the curved wall.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to get the window to the corner by snapping and zooming well enough, but it&#39;s easy to make the attached behavior occur.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to happen for default windows in the Vectorworks Library, as well as any custom made window symbols.<br/>

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance, and have an awesome day!  :)

                Wall Inserts are Handled Inconsistently by Mirror, Rotate, and Move by Points Tools
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The handling of Wall Inserts is inconsistent across the Mirror, Rotate, and Move by Points tools.<br/>
 * When Wall Inserts in at least two different walls (i.e., Walls, Round Walls, or a combination of the two) are selected, the results from using the Mirror, Rotate, and Move by Points tools is not consistent.<br/>
 ** Mirror Tool - Standard Mode: The containing walls of the selected Wall Inserts and all of those walls&#39; inserts, whether selected or not, are moved to the mirrored position.<br/>
 ** Mirror Tool - Duplicate Mode: Duplicates of the selected Wall Inserts are created in the mirrored position.<br/>
 ** Rotate Tool - Standard Mode: The containing walls of the selected Wall Inserts and all of those walls&#39; inserts, whether selected or not, are moved to the rotated position.<br/>
 ** Rotate Tool - Duplicate Mode: Duplicates of the selected Wall Inserts are created in the rotated position.<br/>
 ** Move by Points Tool:<br/>
 *** Object Retention Mode - On: All duplicates created will only be of the selected Wall Inserts.<br/>
 *** Object Retention Mode - Off: The first duplicates created will be the containing walls of the selected Wall Inserts and all of those walls&#39; inserts, whether selected or not. All subsequent duplicates created will only be of the selected Wall Inserts.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The live previews of the Mirror and Rotate tools are also not consistent for Wall Inserts.<br/>
 * The live previews of Wall Inserts differ when using the Mirror tool depending on whether the current projection is 2D Plan or not. When the current projection is 2D Plan, the live previews display correctly except when Wall Inserts in multiple walls (i.e., Walls, Round Walls, or a combination of the two) are selected and the Standard mode of the Mirror tool is used (see following sub bullet point). Please see the following major bullet point for how the live previews of Wall Inserts are displayed incorrectly when the current projection is not 2D Plan and the Mirror tool is used.<br/>
<br/>
 ** When the current projection is 2D Plan, Wall Inserts in multiple walls (i.e., Walls, Round Walls, or a combination of the two) are selected, and the Standard mode of the Mirror tool is used: the live preview only shows the Wall Inserts, but the actual functionality is the containing walls of the selected Wall Inserts and all of those walls&#39; inserts, whether selected or not, will also be moved to the mirrored position.<br/>
 * When the current projection is not 2D Plan, the live previews of the Mirror and Rotate tools are different depending on whether the selected Wall Insert(s) are in a Wall or Round Wall. This appears to be because of the differences between the Drw3DWallNode and Drw3DRoundWallNode functions in Drw.cpp. In particular, the &quot;dc.fpRedrawContext-&gt;IsInDrawingMode(eSelectionIndication)&quot; checks that are only in Drw3DWallNode are likely contributing to some of the differences in behavior since the code for the 3D live previews of the Mirror tool and Rotate tool both include &quot;gDC.fpRedrawContext-&gt;SetDrawingMode( eSelectionIndication, true);&quot;.<br/>
 ** The live previews for Wall Inserts in a Wall are:<br/>
 *** non-existent when only Wall Inserts are selected and the Mirror tool&#39;s Duplicate mode or the Rotate tool&#39;s Duplicate mode is used.<br/>
 *** visible gaps in the containing Wall when only Wall Inserts are selected and the Mirror tool&#39;s Standard mode or the Rotate tool&#39;s Standard mode is used. Note: In this case, the containing Wall and all its inserts are displayed in the live preview and all of the inserts are shown as visible gaps.<br/>
 *** visible gaps in the containing Wall when only containing Walls are selected and the Mirror tool or Rotate tool is used.<br/>
 ** When the Mirror tool and the Rotate tool are used: The live previews for Wall Inserts in a Round Wall are always present and include all of the Wall Insert details. However, the containing Round Walls and all of their Wall Inserts, whether selected or not, also are displayed regardless of whether only Wall Inserts or only their containing Round Walls are selected.<br/>
<br/>

Please see the attached video for examples of the inconsistencies described above. To reproduce these inconsistencies, please use the attached &#39;Wall Inserts.vwx&#39; file.

The attached .vwx file is a conversion from a previous VW version. When we drag the file to a txt editor, we can see that the original is from 20.0.1 converted to 25.0.2<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached .vwx file with 25.0.4<br/>
<br/>
2. Go to the Layer 1 - O (like its shown in the video)<br/>
<br/>
3. Select a wall and see that in the OI Height is 2,8200m which is the wished height but not the height displayed in the 3D object (by measuring the wall we can see that).<br/>
<br/>
4. cmd+x the selected wall and paste back in place. Now the wall is displayed with the correct height. This situation happens to every wall in this Layer.

As you can see, the rotation of the Parquet-Hatch get lost and the hatch is set back to default settings.

<br/>
Open the attached VWX file and notice to two odd holes in the walls (highlighted in red).  The size of the holes are precisely 1&#39;-4&quot; wide by 8&#39;-0&quot; tall.  There is a red symbol named &quot;Chapuis Kitchen Cab 1&quot; that contains a Custom Cabinet of the exact same dimensions.  The document default for the Custom Cabinet tool is also set to the same dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
There is another user also reporting these issues and said the size of his holes are 2&#39;-0&quot; x 5&#39;-11&quot;.  This is the same size as the Custom Cabinet application default.<br/>
<br/>
Users have reported this happening in both Vectorworks 2019 and 2020<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I currently cannot reproduce the problem but I&#39;m hoping this might provide enough information to determine a possible cause.<br/>

Also, if stepping through the objects individually and the components button is selected on the slab, the dialog does not appear and the OIP refreshes to a different view. When choosing the components button with a wall as the primary focus, the dialog appears correctly and the OIP behaves as expected.

Beneath the object draw a round wall. Make sure it has a substantial sweep, such as 200 degrees.<br/>
Select the wall and apply the Fit Walls to Objects command to the top of the wall.<br/>
Note that the round wall may alter its height, but not in conformance with the object to be fitted. In many cases the wall will either partially or entirely protrude above the object, especially if the object is sloped.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that the propensity of the wall to fit to a sloped object seems to depend, in part, on the combination of radius and sweep. In certain cases, reducing the sweep will eventually lead to the wall fitting to the object.<br/>
<br/>
This problem doesn&#39;t seem to exist with non-sloped objects (i.e. perfectly horizontal). But even a slight slope (i.e. 1 degree) is enough to trigger this problem, in this case with multiple little protrusions at the top.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a file containing multiple round walls with different sweeps and radii, demonstrating the problem.

<br/>
The schematic representation of the wall caps is not correct, if two walls of different widths are connected. The caps in the test file uses the line attributes of the components but the wall cap be the connecting uses the line attributes from the wall. The Problem is that the connection cap is using the wall attributes and not attributes from the components. When I use different thick lines or different colors it isn&#39;t practically to handle.<br/>
<br/>
I attach my test file.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for testing.<br/>

 About Problem<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 The settings of the Double Line Tool are not carried over to the new file. Only &quot;Overall Thickness&quot; succeeds normally.<br/>
<br/>
※The settings of other tools(ex.Line Tool) are inherited normally, so all settings should be inherited by the Double Line Tooll as well.<br/>
<br/>
When I open a new file, the &quot;Overall Thickness&quot; of &quot;Double Line Components&quot; and the &quot;Thickness&quot; of &quot;Double Line Components Settings&quot; are different. (Opening the dialog again improved the difference in &quot;Thickness&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
 1. After setting Double Line Tool tool with A file, open B file<br/>
<br/>
2. Thickness values of &quot;Double Line Components&quot; and &quot;Double Line Components Settings&quot; of Double Line Tool are different.<br/>
<br/>
It does not reflect the color. It is black.<br/>
 (It might be fixed after a while, but it will be black when zooming in/out ; Please refer to movie12322_zoominout.mov)<br/>
<br/>
3. Open the dialog again and the Thickness will match.<br/>
<br/>
4, but the Line color and Thickness are still different.<br/>
<br/>
5, I thought it would have returned when I made a new component,<br/>
<br/>
6. When I open another new file, the color returns to black.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;movie12322.mov&quot;,&quot;movie12322_after.mov&quot;,&quot;movie12322_after2.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 *The saved file has been repaired normally, or it remains black.<br/>
 The movement is unstable.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When resetting Vectorworks Preferences, all settings of Double Line Tool are reset except &quot;Separation value&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Since the &quot;Wall Component&quot; of the Wall Tool and the &quot;Width value&quot; of the Door Tool are not changed, it is strange that the settings of the Double Line Tool are reset by resetting Vectorworks Preferences.<br/>

*Remarks*<br/>
*The attached video is the Double Line that I drew for the first time after initializing.<br/>
*Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it doesn&#39;t<br/>
*It&#39;s not clear, but it seems that this is likely to happen when I set the Solid and Thickness of the Line Pen without setting the Fill.<br/>

There you can find:<br/>

<br/>
-1x Window CW width 3m, height 1m = Area 3qm<br/>

If you want to make a quantity takeoff of walls you are interested in the net areas.<br/>

In our example the expected net area value of the wall is 27,00qm<br/>

But depending on the Worksheet function the values differ from 27,00qm<br/>

The classing for the column is inconsistent with other plug-in objects and especially with the Wall. The component classes should be in charge of the 2D appearance of the components, and the object (container) class should control the exterior line weight in the way that the wall does. Right now the &quot;shaft&quot; class does this, but only if there is an architectural component. This class is described as a &quot;finish&quot; class, so I would assume that it would only be for textures, like the classes of the Door and Window tool. Now with Materials, this class should be grayed out if Materials are selected. (Note, I think the component finishes classes have always functioned incorrectly.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have attached a file with the column in its current state and how they should look based on the given settings. These changes are important to draw columns in the same manner that we draw Walls, with a thick lineweight outlining the whole object and thinner lines to delineate components. For those who draw the structural component with a thicker line weight, I believe this fix will also work for them.

Click on few tools like Stake, Mullion, Ramp, Escalator tools.<br/>
When the Object properties dialog is opened note that there is no style pop up or Get Finishes/Classes option do not exist.<br/>

Now click on Pilaster tool. When properties dialog opens you will see Get Finishes/Classes option<br/>
Close the dialog either with OK or cancel<br/>
Now click on all other tools I mentioned above<br/>
When properties dialog open there is structural components options Get Finishes/Classes option and style option will pop up.<br/>

The Planar Boolean node was redesigned a few years ago to cross reference inputs so when new geometry is created by a boolean, that new geometry can be applied to the remaining list of objects. It doesn&#39;t appear to work. In this file, the goal is to find the intersection between circles and a poly. It only seems to act on the first and last circle in the list.<br/>
<br/>
I find I get asked for this functionality a lot, not only in simple geometry creation, but also in graphic calculation.

Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1. Open new file<br/>

4. open the Resource Manager and navigate to Vectorworks Libraries &gt; Defaults &gt; Marionette &gt; Marionette Default Library.vwx &gt; BIM &gt; Walls<br/>

This same bug has reappeared about 5 times in the last week of using 2021 Beta 5.<br/>
<br/>
All blue handles suddenly disappear, and only come back by turning Multiple View Panes off and then back on. It&#39;s happened in a couple different files, though I&#39;m not sure what instigates it.

<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 Same as v2019.<br/>
 A line is displayed when Zooming In and Out.<br/>
 It is not displayed even if the Worksheet Border is set.<br/>
 It is not displayed even if Changing the on / off status of the Unified View.<br/>
 It is not displayed even if Changing the Navigation Graphics.<br/>
<br/>
On Win, if the Line Thickness is set to 0.13 or more, all corner lines will be displayed.<br/>
 On Mac, if the Line Thickness is set to 0.35 or more, all corner lines will be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Lines are displayed correctly in Printing.<br/>
 Lines are not displayed correctly in Exporting PDF / Image Files.<br/>

The video demonstrates starting the Lighting Accessory in &#39;Add&#39; and again &#39;Delete&#39; mode for this tool.  It seems like the &#39;Delete&#39; mode might be issue here, but it breaks regardless.  In the video you will also notice that after the tool breaks I am able to open another file and use the tool until these steps are taken.  Closing Vectorworks will fix the tool until these steps are taken again. <br/>

This is reproducible on Windows and Mac.

Open the sample file and note the direction of the front of the fixture and the location of the red box in 2D Plan View.<br/>
<br/>
Switch to 3D Top view and note that the location of the red box changes and the fixture points the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
The user can compensate by manually by using the Custom Pan Rotation but they should not have to do this for standard rotations.<br/>

                Meshes Hard to Select in OpenGL (Occluded Selection Not Working)
    </p>
</td>

 * open [^trivial.vwx]<br/>
 * try to drag the mesh<br/>
Notice that selecting/dragging a mesh fails sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
===== ORIGINAL BUG =================<br/>
<br/>
When working on a 3D model in OpenGL, quite frequently meshes are much harder to select than they should be. They&#39;re only selectable by very specific points, and clicking elsewhere on the mesh will see &quot;through&quot; the mesh and select the object behind it. I encounter this constantly when modeling, and today decided to screen record a couple examples in a current file, attached. (I also see students get frustrated with this frequently).<br/>
<br/>
OpenGL selection should always see the solid faces of objects for selection purposes (assuming &quot;Use Occluded Selection and Snapping&quot; is on in VW Prefs).<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, if I turn off &quot;Use Occluded Selection and Snapping,&quot; then selection seems to work slightly better, even though that&#39;s the opposite of that checkbox&#39;s intended function.<br/>
<br/>
This all needs to be made super reliable, otherwise it makes the software feel buggy and frustrating.

In the previous version, the icons were shown against a light background. This made the icons fairly legible, in spite of their tiny size.<br/>
<br/>
In the new version, only the selected tab is shown against a light background. The rest are shown against a dark background. This makes the icon details extremely challenging to discern, especially on a high-resolution monitor–not only because the images are very small, but also because the content of those icons is of a similar tone to the background.<br/>

The UI revision in this case has mde the Navigation palette significantly harder and more effortful to use.<br/>

<br/>
In the attached .vwx file there is a Polyline with a Lineart. We have clients complaning about the fact that the Lineart doesn&#39;t follow the polyline in the curve when Best Performance is active, showing an inaccurate curving that doesn&#39;t represent what is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to improve this situation in a way that the Lineart follows the curve given by the Polyline? Thank you in advance.<br/>
<br/>
For now the Clients are being advised to use Good Performance and Compatibility to workaround this problem.

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
 1. Create a trussystem (e.g. 4x2m of FD34)<br/>
 2. Active one item of the system<br/>
 3. In info-Palette click on &quot;Select System Objects&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now the Move and Move 3D command shortcuts doesn&#39;t work anymore.<br/>
 It works fine, when selecting the trusses manually.<br/>

                UI: Palette disappearing when dragging palette from 4K to 2K display (Windows only)
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
In this case the user has two setups: one with a MacBook Pro and one with a Windows Desktop.<br/>
<br/>
The issue (see video) is not reproducible with the MacBook setup.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the specs of the Windows setup:<br/>
 * Windows 10 Pro<br/>
 * NVIDIA Quadro K4000 (3*DP, 1*DVI)<br/>
 * (1) EIZO FlexScan EV2785 (4K)<br/>
connected via HDMI cable with an adapter to display port<br/>
 * (2) LG 27MP67VQ-P (1080p)<br/>
connected via DVI cable and connectors<br/>
<br/>
The Vectorworks application window is on the 4K display. When you drag a palette from there to the 2K display, the palette is not visible. If you drag the palette to the 2K display, but don&#39;t release the mouse button and drag it back to the 4K display, the palette is visible again, but has a huge offset to the mouse cursor.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution to get the palette back, is to disconnect the 2K display and disable/reenable the palette.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we will likely see an increase in cases like these.

This problem has reported from our Tech Support.<br/>
It seems 15 users complained the same problem.<br/>
They said, unable to import any PDF files.<br/>
When you attempt to import a PDF file, a message that says“Unable to import some or all of the document’s pages”shows.<br/>
But, we couldn&#39;t reproduce.<br/>
<br/>
Some users have common environments, like below.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
-PC Manufacturers: Microsoft or Fujitsu<br/>
-Applications: iTunes, Google Chrome and ESET<br/>
-Operating System Version: 1909<br/>
-Operating System build: 18363.900 <br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Tech Support asked them to re-install VW, re-install the Operating System and stop ESET, but it wasn&#39;t fixed.<br/>
Also, Tech Support asked them to export and import PDF on a new document, but the problem reproduced.<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if you have any information about this problem.<br/>

<br/>
For example in ConnectCAD Socket tool, there is a Signal pulldown that has separators in it. If you select a signal after the first separator, in the SOD- tool modes you’ll see that the selection there is one under the correct one. If you select a signal that has more separators before it in the pulldown you will see that the offset between the shown and correct signal in SOD grows.

                List Browser does not return the correct EListBrowserEventType, if a click is close to the adjacent column
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
Steps to recreate the bug:<br/>
<br/>
1) Open a new file<br/>
<br/>
2) Drag the .ifc file to Vectorworks, in order to import the IFC file<br/>
<br/>
3) Waith for the Select IFC Stories and Elements dialog to pop up<br/>
<br/>
4) Press the Elements radio button<br/>
<br/>
5) Hover over a row in the Name column, but close to the adjacent column (image attached)<br/>
<br/>
6) Click on the row<br/>
<br/>
7) The Row turns white.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now what happens is the event that the dialog receives is _kListBrowserEventType_DataChangeClick_, instead of _kListBrowserEventType_SelectionChangeClick_. So the dialog marks the row in white as it thinks the tick column is pressed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There is also something strange that happens. When I try to debug the GetListBrowserEvent function, it returns the correct value. But if I don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t. This is really something that makes zero sense to me. I have attached a screenshot of two Breakpoints in the class that handles clicking on this List Browser. Depending on which one is Enabled the result for the EListBrowserEventType seems to be different. I want to reiterate this makes zero sense to me, but it is happening.

In the Viewport Annotation Redraw Test 1.vwx file. Go to Sheet Layer 1, Select the viewport and Edit Annotations. If you then hold down the space bar to get the Pan (Hand) tool and drag, I see a faint red line down the right edge and a faint green line at the top. Both go away as soon as I release the mouse button or let up the space bar.<br/>
<br/>
For a more drastic example, Open Viewport Annotation Redraw Test 2.vwx. Go to Sheet Layer M2-1. Select and edit the annotations on the left viewport. Hold down the shift bar to pan. As soon as you move the mouse position there is substantial horizontal banding. If you do the same to the right viewport there is no banding.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Manually move the symbol to the correct elevation<br/>
-Save and Commit<br/>
-Now close the WF and reopen the PF<br/>
<br/>
Note that the symbol has reverted to its original elevation.<br/>
<br/>
If the symbol&#39;s Z Ref is changed to &quot;Layer Elevation&quot; the problem won&#39;t occur.<br/>
<br/>
In regular VWX files, if you move the symbol then save/close/reopen, it&#39;ll remain at the correct elevation. So even though this is a sort of a user error it still seems like the change should get committed.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in previous versions.

To reproduce the problem completely, you need to update all the viewports you wish to export after opening the file.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe also useful to know: When you put the navigation mode to &quot;good performance and compatibility and you update the viewport again, you have the same problem as in the PDF export: the Renderworks rendering is not visible.<br/>
<br/>
Even more worrying is the following: when any of the objects (even newly created ones) are copied to a new empty document, the new document is infected with the same issue. So importing the design layer to in a new document doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
I added two files: a slim one (slim.vwx), where I kept just one element in one design layer and one viewport on one sheet layer. The other document (full.vwx) is the client&#39;s original document. I tested the viewports from the first page of the active sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Open one of the added documents<br/>
2. update all viewports on the active sheet layer<br/>
3. execute a PDF export<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll see that the renderworks renders are not included in the exported PDF<br/>

I apologize, I see the issue now. I exported this back to 2019 to see if it works there and it does. I would recommend trying that out on your end and sending it as a bug.<br/>

Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you submit this as a bug. I cannot find why it won&#39;t render in this file in Fast Renderworks but I saw rebuilding it like you had will allow it to render. I exported this file to 2019 and it renders as it should in Fast Renderworks.<br/>

<br/>
We have had a couple of users emailing in with the same issue, we can also replicate this in-house. The custom leaf symbols seem to be taking the texture from the attributes and not from a texture of class.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached one of the user&#39;s test files and a recording I have sent the user on how to fix the custom leaf by assigning a class through the 3D component of the custom leaf and making sure the attributes are set to class style. <br/>
<br/>
This wasn&#39;t the case within Vectorworks 2019 but happens with custom leaf within 2020 and also 2021.<br/>
<br/>
Email from user: <br/>
<br/>
_I have a problem with door glazing appearing as opaque blue instead of clear glass since moving to v2020_<br/>
<br/>
_Any custom door set has this - as well as previous doors from legacy versions - which appear with clear glass in 2019 - change to opaque blue when opening in v2020._<br/>
<br/>
_Test file and screengrabs attached showing that the glazing is set to Glass-Clear and that the texture is set to Glass Clear RT - all defaults anyway._<br/>
<br/>
_It only happens on Custom door leafs - but if I open the Custom Leaves.vwx file from Libraries/Defaults they appear with correctly clear glass._<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need any further information. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen <br/>

The App Help page states that &quot;Points isolation operations do not work on any points located outside an active clip cube&quot;, but what is isolated will apply to whatever is being hidden by the Clip Cube as well. Both the user and I were under the impression that the contents hidden with the Clip Cube wouldn&#39;t be cut out when Isolating Points.<br/>

                SBE: Vectorworks uses wrong rendering texture for subobjects of PIOs
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      - Open attached testfile &quot;no_material_railing-fence-texture-none-sb-2c.vwx&quot;<br/>
- Watch attached movie &quot;ungroup_top_rail_changes_texture.mov&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the top rail is rendered in green (texture &quot;Covergreen Vinca minor RT&quot;).<br/>
This is wrong. The top rail has no texture assigned to it (you may check via DebugWindow or other debugging tools). It should simply display its solid fill.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Vectorworks uses &quot;Covergreen Vinca minor RT&quot; because it is the class texture of the PIO container&#39;s class &quot;Handrail-Steel&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But the top rail is not set to &quot;Texture by class&quot;. It is not even in the same class as the PIO container. It has a building material assigned to it (Wood Walnut MT), but no texture.<br/>
<br/>
So obviously it should never be rendered using &quot;Covergreen Vinca minor RT&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Even weirder: if I ungroup the PIO, the green rendering disappears and the correct (solid) fill appears.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So it looks as if the rendering algorithm overrides the texture (&quot;None&quot;) that was actually set to the top rail by the class texture of the PIO&#39;s container class. This is wrong, the value (&quot;None&quot;) set by the PIO must not be overridden.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a bug of the railing/fence PIO so please assign it to the engineer in charge of rendering.<br/>
<br/>
PS Before analyzing, don&#39;t do anything that might trigger a regeneration of the railing/fence PIO.

                Site Model Surface Highlighting Fails, Makes it Difficult to Add Enscape Assets
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The attached movie and test file show this in VW 2018 compared to VW 2019, since the problem appeared between the two. The file contains a Site Model with several modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in each version<br/>
-Activate any tool that supports Automatic plane highlighting<br/>
-Place the cursor over the top of the Site Model<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2018, note that the surface of the Site Model gets highlighted as expected.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2019, note that the bottom face of the Site Model gets highlighted instead.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in VW 2020 and 2021.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020 SP4 we added support for the Enscape Asset Library, where Enscape objects are placed inside VW. The basic workflow for adding Enscape vegetation involves snapping to the surface of the Site Model in 3D views, so this bug disrupts that workflow.

                Opening one file in VW 2021 is so slow as to be unusable

<br/>
I originally started work in VW 2019, and experienced slow file performance. I then exported the file back to earlier versions of VW and noticed much quicker program response. I also opened the file in VW 2020 and VW 2021 where performance got worse.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020, the progress display vanishes in ~5 seconds, but screen redraw continues until 4:22 after clicking OPEN. File is editable, but very slow on redraw. Each full screen redraw takes another 4 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021, the progress display vanishes in ~4 seconds, but the VW window does not completely refresh and pauses until for about 2:45 sec to 3:45 sec (measured on several attempts.) The items in the window are not completely drawn and continue to fill in slowly, while the computer fan becomes audible and accelerates. In the next minute or so, the entire computer becomes sluggish and the fan contintues to race. It took me nearly a minute to invoke the &quot;Force Quit Application&quot; window to open and to click on the VW 2021 app, then click the two OK buttons to kill it. After the VW 2021 app was killed, I took a screenshot of the CPU useage in Activity Monitor. All 4 cores (8 threads) were very red. Once while waiting for VW 2021 to open the file, I took a screen shot of Activity Monitor showing 390% CPU Usage. Images attached.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am attaching the VW 2021 file and exports in VW 2020, 2018, 2016, and 2014 formats that I used to test VW opening times in older versions. File opening times are shown below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Opening the file in the following versions resulted it these times:<br/>
VW 2014 - 8s<br/>
VW 2015 - 7s<br/>
VW 2016 - 11s<br/>
VW 2017 - 5s<br/>
VW 2018 - 2m 38s<br/>
VW 2019 - 3m 15s<br/>
VW 2021 - 2m 45s, redraw is not finished and computer fan becomes audible. File is not editable at this time, only partly visible.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On one test run where I waited for VW 2021 respond after opening, the beachball spun for over 10 minutes. Closing the file then took more than 4 minutes and I killed the program. Fan was at full blast.<br/>
<br/>
On another run, I received an Alert that showed VW2021 paused, due to no more application memory. Image attached. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am also including one crash log when I terminated VW 2021 with  the fan running full out.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in SP2<br/>
-In any 3D view, drag the Camera&#39;s middle blue handle and snap to any point on the Extrude<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Camera gets focused correctly.<br/>
<br/>
-Now open the file in SP3 and try the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Camera gets focused on some random area.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this regression was caused by the 519255 change, which fixed VB-164699 and VB-165934.

                                            <td class="description">      We&#39;ve had a few complaints that Augment3d isn&#39;t getting the positions of objects when exported - the objects &#39;appear&#39; in the right place, but their XYZ coordinates are always (0,0,0)<br/>
<br/>
Our users are expecting to be able to see the original positions within Augment3d.<br/>
This is so they can use the Eos/Augment3d features like &quot;Scenic Element Movable&quot; to move the pieces of scenery around using the &#39;real&#39; position values in Eos, and see the actual set piece positions when adding other items (fixtures, mobile set pieces etc)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it turns out that while Vectorworks&#39; Collada exporter is creating a reasonable hierarchy, every node has an identity transform and instead the actual positions of objects are being baked into triangulated geometry.<br/>
<br/>
This makes the export effectively unusable for many of our users - the only way we&#39;ve found so far to get the actual scenic object positions into A3D is to manually re-enter all the important positions so Augment3d can reparent the objects.<br/>
That takes a very long time for a large set!<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
If you create a 2x2x2 cube centred at the position (0, 0, 10) as displayed in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
On export, the user expects a node at (0,0,10) containing a cube mesh with opposite corners (-1, -1, -1) , (1,1,1) - the same as appears in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Vectorworks exports a node at (0,0,0) containing a cube mesh with opposite corners at (-1,-1,9) and (1,1,11).<br/>
<br/>
We see the same thing with FBX export. I don&#39;t think the user has tried any other formats.<br/>
<br/>
So:<br/>
Is there an option to include the object transforms in the export that our users and ourselves may have missed?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can this please be fixed for either the Collada (DAE) or FBX exports?<br/>
(We can point users to the &#39;right&#39; format once we know which one works)<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other export formats where Vectorworks does​ preserve the original object transforms in the export?<br/>

<br/>
This file was imported into VW2020 from VW2017<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2017 it had no rendering problems.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020 in Shaded or OpenGL it has no problems, but when rendered in Final Quality RW it creates rendering problems as if part of the geometry has shifted<br/>
Custom RW has the same problem, but using the Renderbitmap tool works as expected<br/>

The texture Siding-vertical Taupe has what appears to be a gradient appearance in the resource browser. This is not correct. It is a tile image.<br/>

The other thing that sometimes works is to adjust (override) the brightness of the light object in the Visualisation palette, or the Ambient Info Brightness in the Lighting Options dialogue of the OIP?<br/>
<br/>
Here are my light/lighting settings below…<br/>

                FBX Export: This object causes empty or corrupt FBX, and Cineware Error
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I have a model with a few thousand objects in it which I&#39;ve been trying for a few days now to export as an FBX to send to a film VFX company. However the export kept on failing: either no FBX file would be created at the end of the export process, or the file would be empty or unopenable.<br/>
<br/>
After spending a few more hours today trying to isolate WHICH of the many objects was causing the problem I believe I narrowed it down to a hamper symbol which I&#39;ve attached. The mesh was originally imported from the SketchUp 3D Warehouse. It seems to specifically be the casters which are causing the problem, because if I delete the casters entirely then the FBX finally exports properly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also attaching an &#39;empty&#39; FBX that I just export of the problematic meshes. Notice it&#39;s only 6KB. When I delete the casters the exported FBX ends up being 785 KB.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other telling sign of the FBX failing was that when I close Vectorworks I get a Cineware Error message (attached, along with the .txt file it references).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;ve worked around the bug for the moment, if there are any insights gained about the underlying cause I&#39;d love to know so I can avoid it in the future. Unfortunately I wasted about 5 hours this week dealing with these FBX issues.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

When updating the viewport in VW 2021, it gives a memory error.<br/>

Important note: The sheet layer viewport is of a section line design layer viewport. This could be the root cause of the issue. The EU made a viewport of the section line design layer viewport to compensate for another issue with renderworks not displaying the the view correctly.<br/>
<br/>
The viewport updates correctly in VW 2019.

Usually Vectorworks will hang within 10 tries.  If it does not hang, try reverting the file and repeat them again.

In the Viewport we can see 3 Symbols with a Grass Material and render is Renderworks.<br/>
From this 3 Symbols, only one shows the Grass Material.<br/>
<br/>
Like it is shown in the video, after we convert all 3 Symbols to a Group, then the Grass Material is displayed in all of the 3.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, I drag the same Symbol 3 more times to the drawing area and we can see again that only one displayed the Grass Material. ...and again by converting this 3 symbols to groups, then all 3 display the Grass Material.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t we have more than one Symbol with the Grass Material? Is this wanted?

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version, enter the 3D Component and render in RW.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, note that this causes the Clip Cube to shift so that all of the symbol contents are outside the extents and no longer show. It also shows an odd, flattened copy of the render.<br/>

This is probably related to the bug reported in VB-164365.<br/>

I found as a work around is to right click on the viewport and click edit and returning to the design layer.  I set View &gt; Layer Options to show snap modify others and from that perspective view, create a new viewport.  That new viewport will render, and an interesting byproduct of that new viewport, the original viewport will now render.<br/>

I found that exporting this file down to 2019, the viewport renders as it should without issue or need to recreate a perspective view.

            Hi, <br/>
<br/>
It seems that custom-light doesn&#39;t work anymore – when I try to add a light distribution file (.ies), there comes an error: file is invalid. Also, the custom-lights that I already have in a VectorWorks-file don&#39;t work anymore. I can&#39;t select them anymore. Problem is not file-related – if I open a new file and try to add a custom-light, the same thing happens. <br/>
<br/>
This custom-light in a very, very important function for me. <br/>
<br/>
Best, <br/>

<br/>
With 2018 it was possible to cast a shadow on a 2D object, like shown on the screenshot. Now that action is not possible anymore, the object must be 3D for that to happen. I have tested with 2019 and has the exact same result like 2020.<br/>
<br/>
We got this from a Stockist and wants to know why isn&#39;t possible anymore. I do believe this was a change in 2019? Can I get a confirmation on that and exactly when and why, please?<br/>

It has windows that were originally created in VW2020 and converted to 2021. I have since created new window styles in 2021 and applied them to the old windows. However, sometimes when I open the file in 2021, I noticed that the glazing of the window is opaque in 3D, or the sashes have no texture, or the munitions have disappeared, etc. I think this is only happening with the &quot;Custom Existing Masonry&quot; window style but I can&#39;t be sure. I can correct this by converting the window to an unstyled window and then reapplying the same window style, but every time I save, close, and reopen the file, there are windows that have been corrupted and I have to do this workaround for them to appear correctly in 3D.

                Export/Send to Cinema 4D Causes Graphics to Fail in VW When RW Camera Exists

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-In Top/Plan view, export the file to C4D using default settings<br/>
-Now zoom/pan in the drawing<br/>
<br/>
Note that the objects show their graphics incorrectly. If you switch to Top/Plan view again everything will show correctly except for the RW Camera, which will be invisible. If you switch to 3D and then back to Top/Plan one more time, the Camera will then become visible.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen if an RW Camera exists in the file and the export is done while in Top/Plan view.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2019.

 * _Moving an object when editing a RW camera does cause the viewport to go out of date and shows the changes_<br/>

_Overall some changes when editing a document when editing in a design layer via edit camera and edit design layer seem to be different._

<br/>
As you can see in the video, the drawing has a few Symbols in Wall next to the Windows. This Symbols are in the correct place when with any Render Mode (for example OpenGL), except when Renderworks is used.<br/>
<br/>
If Renderworks is activated, the Symbols in Wall appear visibly more to the left side of the excepted / original position.<br/>
<br/>
Switching Navigation Graphics or Perspective type changes nothing.

OpenGL renders partially and Renderworks doesn&#39;t show the view, instead we see everything brown / black.<br/>
<br/>
In the Video, minute 6:50 we can see that after deleting the objects behind the camera and rendering again with Renderworks now works properly.

I have suggested that the user could simplify his 3D modelling process as creating a simple extrusion will render with the custom RW texture.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if this is not a bug, but rather user error.  I was not sure if the custom texture and the 3D shape were conflicting with each other some how.<br/>

I suspect its the Apply artistic edges setting.

1) Create a Renderworks Style with enabling &quot;Apply Artistic Edges&quot; option on &quot;Edges&quot; tab.<br/>
2) Place a VBvisual Plant object. (Easy to see, if you place to far from the user origin.)<br/>
3) Run the Renderworks Style.<br/>
4) The trunk will remain on the placed location, but the branches and leaves will show on the user origin.<br/>

<br/>
With OpenGL is possible to see the image, but when we switch to Renderworks the image is not shown anymore. The Window glass material is transparent and even by switching any material definitions, there are no changes. The image is not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Image cannot be seen because they aren&#39;t to be seen in RenderWorks. Can you confirm that this is not a failure and Images aren&#39;t expected to be seen in RenderWorks? I remember with 2017 and 2018 (and I believe 2019 too) I could do a Workaround, in which I would create an Extrude object and create a group together with the image. Then the image would be seen in 3D RenderWorks, because of being grouped with an Extrude. Right now with 2020 and 2021 I&#39;m not being able to execute this Workaround anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Any solution to get this image to be seen with Renderworks?<br/>
Thank you in advance.

Target environment<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Win Mac<br/>
It occurs in v2020.<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
How to Reproduce<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When rendering, the Texture Color Image of Shaders may not be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
(Unified View is turned off in advance.)<br/>
1) Open the sample file (sample10653original.vwx)<br/>
2) Check Unified View<br/>
3) Execute RW rendering<br/>
4) Set Indirect Lighting of Lighting Options to &quot;Exterior, 3 Bounces&quot;<br/>
5) The Texture Color Image of Shaders is not displayed.<br/>
Only the Texture Bump Image is displayed in a valid state.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample10653original.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie10653.mov&quot;,<br/>
 &quot;Off_Unified view.png&quot;,&quot;On_Unified view.png&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
------<br/>
It does not occur in the below steps <br/>
<br/>
Open the sample file &gt; Execute RW rendering &gt; Set Indirect Lighting of Litiong Options to &quot;Exterior, 3 Bounces&quot; &gt; Check Unified View<br/>
------<br/>
I tried to create it from scratch with a new file, but it was difficult to reproduce this problem.(Both English and Japanese versions)<br/>
It could be reproduced only once in the Japanese version of Win, but could not be reproduced thereafter.<br/>
The rule to reproduce is uncertain.<br/>
---<br/>
I tried with resources (*Stone Fieldstone Wall 01 White RT) that seem to be equivalent, but could not reproduce.<br/>

 Target environment<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 Mac/Win<br/>

v2021 as well<br/>

 About Problem<br/>
 --------------------------<br/>
 The rendering result of Area Light and the representation of area light figures are different from the previous version.<br/>
<br/>
-Please refer to &quot;sample200709.vwx&quot;, &quot;movie12265.vwx&quot; <br/>
 *The color of the Area Light is light blue so that it would be easy to understand.<br/>
<br/>
v2019 or below:<br/>
 -Area Ligh turns white,<br/>
 the surface is not rough.<br/>
<br/>
v2020, v2021:<br/>
 -Area Light itself turns black,<br/>
 the surface of the Extrude illuminated by the light reflects the specified color, but it has a rough expression like noise.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 *The same result was obtained by switching the OIP Quality to &quot;Very High&quot;.<br/>
 *If I remove the option of &quot;Render Geometry&quot; of OIP, the shape of Area Light disappears, but the rendering result will be the same as 2019 or below.<br/>

It will (or should) open. Then go to Unrotated Plan (0 degrees). It will unrotated but subsequently stalls with spinning beach ball. At that point Force Quit will not work, nor can I select any other program on computer. Only way out is a hard restart of entire system.<br/>
<br/>
I was able once to get the plan rotated back to zero, and I sent the file to an associate. He did some edits and sent it back to me. He says it was not rotated on his end, however, when I opened the file it opened rotated and again froze up my entire system. <br/>
<br/>
This occurred both on 2021 B6 and on 2021 RC 1.

I did end up fixing this by replacing the Export3DPDF.vwr file in the Plug-Ins folder. My inkling is that something in the VWR file needs to be non-localized so beta testers don&#39;t localize it.<br/>

<br/>
This is probably minor issue though since the localization hasn&#39;t changed in 3D PDF for years.

 # Select the Push Pull tool and hover around the area where the wall component geometry was.<br/>

Notice faces of the Wall and Slab component geometry incorrectly highlights and can be operated on by the tool.  Also, this gets in the way of the tool operating on visible objects (the extrude in this case) behind the wall.

2. 477_Details Akustikdecken Klassenzimmer.vwx<br/>
This file when Publishing to PDF, gives PDFs with sizes between about 3MB and 28MB<br/>
<br/>
Both .vwx files have more or less the same objects in the drawing and RM. Even though they aren&#39;t exactly the same and normal that there is some difference. Between 5MB maximum size compared to 28MB, was enough for the Customer to complain and ask why.<br/>
<br/>
This are Viewports, which do not include all the objects in the drawing. When the PDF is exported, it calculates all objects including the ones that are not seen by the Viewport. When removing all objects outside of the Viewport area, the PDF file size decreased significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Is this situation wished? Is there a possibility to have calculated int he file size only the objects shown in the PDF? If this is WAD... would be possible to have this changed to an Enhancement, please?<br/>
<br/>

I happen to be working with rasterized PDFs; not sure if that&#39;s part of the issue or not.<br/>
<br/>
The Navigation Graphics setting doesn&#39;t seem to have any affect on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Two screen recordings are attached. The first one is more recent and shows the issue on a freshly imported PDF. (Not sure why the re-rendering of the PDF at each zoom level is particularly slow for this screen recording).<br/>
<br/>
The second screen recording is a bit older; I originally thought the problem had to do with cropped PDFs specifically. I was finding that adding a crop caused the disappearing issue to occur, but then entering and exiting the crop edit window would solve it.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve since found that the issue also pops up with uncropped PDFs, so I&#39;m not too sure what the cause might be.<br/>

Export DWG/DXF has a checkbox to export classes (as layers) and this also works for referenced viewports.<br/>

Export PDF has also a checkbox, but it&#39;s not working for referenced viewports.<br/>

Unfortunately export of classes into a PDF-document is a requirement in a current project of one of our customers and this project has several building in severals documents and uses ref. viewports.<br/>

But when I place that symbol on my drawing, it is placed in the None Class. If my Class Options is set to Show/Snap others (and the None class is the active class)....I can marque around that symbol and select it, but I +can&#39;t+ click on it to select. Is that WAD? I&#39;ve never noticed this but it makes no sense. The symbol itself is sitting on the None class, my active class, so shouldn&#39;t I be able to click on the symbol to select it?<br/>

I can send a video if necc to demonstrate.<br/>

To reproduce, open the file in each version and move the Mesh.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2018, note that the pre-selection highlighting still works correctly.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2019, note that the highlighting fails.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases the highlighting will work if you place the cursor in a specific area near the bottom of the Mesh.<br/>

This also happens in VW 2020 and 2021.

<br/>
Then switch to rotated plan, and switch to Top... Now when you move the Image Prop and snap to another object, it changes the Z height of the Image Prop to match the Z of the snapped point. It does this even when the Active Plane is set to Screen Plane.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason the Z value should be changing since that&#39;s perpendicular to the view.<br/>

I have provided a screen recording of creating a regular rectangle and rounded rectangle to show that the duplicate rounded rectangle is not selectable the same way the regular rectangle is.  <br/>

I have found that if you copy and paste or duplicate the rounded rectangle, it can be selected by clicking anywhere in the object.<br/>

So far I have tested this all the way back to 2018 and it behaves with this issue and it appears in both windows and Mac.  Is this working as designed?

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Render in OpenGL<br/>
-Activate the Clip Cube and resize it as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that some of the Spaces show their fills in the cut plane, but most don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Using the Clip Cube is a good way to error-check the 3D Space fittings to make sure there are no unwanted gaps, so this bug kind of kills that option.<br/>
<br/>
If you create a Section Viewport that cuts through the Spaces, all of them will show their fills in the section plane graphics.

 <br/>
<br/>
■ How to Reproduce<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a “circle” (Dia : 1000mm / Perim : 3142mm) and execute the “Extrude” command. (Height: 2000mm)<br/>
<br/>
2. Select the “Extrude” object with &quot;Extract Surface Mode&quot; of the &quot;Extract&quot; tool.<br/>
<br/>
3. Select the created “NURBS Surface” and execute the “Unfold Surfaces” command.<br/>
<br/>
4. The polyline&#39;s “Perim” is 3129mm while the “Perim” of the circle is 3142mm.<br/>
<br/>
5. The “Perim” of the “Polyline” that was executed with the “Unfold Surfaces” command on the “Extrude” object (Solid Section) on which the ”Split” tool was executed also does not become 3142 mm.<br/>
<br/>
6.The “Perim” is 3129mm and 3131mm, even if compareing the “Polyline” that executed the &quot;Unfold Surfaces&quot; command in the attached file.<br/>

<br/>
In this document, you will find a viewport. Inside of the viewport annotations, there are two rectangles with tile fills. The tile resource geometry is in the class called “Geometry in Tile”. This class is currently turned off in the viewport class settings.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the navigation graphics for Best Performance, the geometry in the tile shows; however, it doesn’t export or print.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the navigation graphics for Good Performance and Compatibility or Best Compatibility, the geometry doesn’t show on screen and it doesn’t print/export.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be an issue with the Best Performance navigation setting.

                KLS: Ghostobjects in Vectorworks 2020
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there, since 2020 we randomly do have sort of &quot;ghostobjects&quot;.<br/>
This could be our german windows or doors, or a lighting device.<br/>
Considering windows and doors this might happen when using section viewports, edit section in place, edit 2D-components.<br/>
<br/>
The video &quot;Ghostobjects.mp4&quot; is from a customer (with a sense of humor). In this video you see a red ghostobject.<br/>
<br/>
Or see the screenshot &quot;GhostobjectGermanWindow.png&quot;. The ghostobject here was located at Vectorworks origin and seen in every layer, even sheet layers.<br/>
I also attached my testfile &quot;GhostobjectGermanWindow.vwx&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The big problem with ghostobjects is, that they disappear after closing and reopening the file.<br/>
So, in my testfile the ghostobject is gone. However, maybe you still could analyse something in this file.<br/>
<br/>
Video &quot;Geisterobjekte.mp4&quot; is from the same customer (with the sense humor) as above.<br/>
Also from this customer the scrennshots in folder &quot;Ghostobjects on three Macs&quot;. Here you see screenshots of ghostobjects on three different Macs.<br/>
Up to now the ghostobjets seem to be related to Mac only. But that is only a guess of mine.<br/>
<br/>
All ghostobjects do have in common, that they disappear when you close (better say save and close) and reopen the file.<br/>
Also that the ghostobjects do appear only randomly and not very often.

                Space Boundary Wall Picking Fails When Wall Coincides with Edge of Space

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a wall network with a Space object whose top edge coincides with the bottom edge of a virtual wall. <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
-Select the Space and choose &quot;Pick Boundary&quot; from the OIP Auto-Boundary menu<br/>
-Try to highlight the virtual wall<br/>
<br/>
Note that it can only be highlighted if you zoom-in closely on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
If the virtual wall coincides with the edge of another 2D shape or plugin the picking works fine, so this only seems to happen when the wall coincides with Space edges. <br/>
<br/>
Since the &quot;1-Walls&quot; layer is stacked on top of the &quot;1-Spaces&quot; layer it seems like the virtual wall should have picking priority over the edge of the Space, so you should be able to highlight it at any zoom level.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in past versions.<br/>

<br/>
-Make the &quot;NonPlot&quot; class invisible, which will cause the locus associated with the Stair&#39;s upper floor to become invisible<br/>
-Now draw a selection marquee over the area where the locus was<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Stair still gets selected, even though there&#39;s no geometry there. In general it seems like bad practice to allow invisible things to be selected.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in previous versions.

<br/>
1. Open the attached .vwx file<br/>
<br/>
2. Select the Extrude that is in the drawing and move an endpoint or middle point to change the extrude shape.<br/>
<br/>
The Extrude will move place instead of changing shape. By double clicking the Extude, its only then possible to change its shape. Newly created extrudes do not present this problem.

                C4D exports for Twinmotion should bake alpha masks into color map

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Twinmotion does not handle color and alpha masks being separate.  The mask must be baked into the alpha of the color map.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I looked into this and there is a routine that runs when you edit textures, that Tamsin requested, that if the maps are the same size it does try to bake the mask into the color map.  But what I am seeing is that the PNG file that comes out is 32 bits and I think has the aplha but is not a &quot;PNG with Alpha&quot; for some reason.  I think the fix is to get the result of that routine to go out as PNG with alpha, when doing C4D export.  I ended up in the raw image image export code at one point.  Maybe the flag can be set in there.  The routine that manipulates the color image when you use the Edit Texture dialog is <br/>
<br/>
MultiplyColorImageByMask.<br/>

<br/>
I have received a file from a customer that is experiencing crashing when you turn off a particular class and re render.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen when zoomed in on the particular area. However, if you switch to top/plan and do the exact same same thing the crashing does not happen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
See attached video.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see anything that could be causing this. The customer informed me that there was a DWG import.

<br/>
[https://analytics.vectorworks.net/crashes?crashId=6071869]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a few movies and a test file that show this. The file contains a building model saved in Multi-View.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-In the top-left pane, use CTL+Middle Mouse Button to activate the Flyover tool in boomerang mode, and do a few flyover operations<br/>
 -Now quickly press Shift+CMD+G to render in OpenGL<br/>
<br/>
Note that VW will sometimes either freeze or crash. Overall I&#39;ve gotten 4 freezes and 4 crashes. Most were in build 557162 but I also got a crash in build 558073.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movies show three of the crashes. Crash logs are also attached.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the crash logs some of these might be different crashes. If they need to be moved to separate reports just let me know.<br/>
<br/>
This might have to do with the timing of how quickly the shortcuts are pressed, though it&#39;s hard to be sure. I have a habit of pressing these quickly and often throughout a project and haven&#39;t had this problem before, so it looks like a 2021 regression.<br/>
<br/>
This might be related to the bug reported in VB-171383, though I can no longer duplicate that in recent builds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not seeing these crashes in Analytics for some reason...

Same files on the same machine with VW2018 run smoothly<br/>

The crashes occur when moving to OpenGL in a specific camera on the scene<br/>

Here is what Joseph wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unfortunately, I am not getting much useful information from the crash logs. It looks like the majority of the crashes are related to Snapping, but I am not sure what the exact cause is. At this point, I think it would be best for you to submit the crash logs and the Vectorworks file on JIRA so that our engineering team can take a look. They might be able to pull more useful information from the crash details.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
attached is a customer file with an animation path. Selecting that path and creating a movie takes pretty long.<br/>
<br/>
A workaround for the customer is to use a 3D-polygon instead of a NURBS-curve.<br/>
<br/>
I send you the file because of the dramatic loss of performance when using a NURBS-curve as animation path.

This happens in 2020 as well, but the ghosting is only visible when panning or zooming.  Looks like its like to the best performance navigation graphics setting, when I set it to good performance, this issue goes away.

                Multi-View - Objects Get Drawn in the Wrong Location After Switching to Rotated Plan Pane

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make the left view pane active<br/>
-Now activate the Rectangle tool and draw an object in the right view pane<br/>
-Without zooming or panning, switch to the Circle or Wall tools and draw some objects in the left pane<br/>
<br/>
Note that they get placed in the wrong location.<br/>
<br/>
If you zoom/pan in the left pane before switching the tool, the problem won&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen with all tools. For example if you try it with the Oval or Rounded Rectangle tools (instead of the Circle/Wall tools), you won&#39;t see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in previous versions.

But now new plugin speaker / speaker can&#39;t acces to workgroup folders to get symbols.<br/>

<br/>
Here is the output of one such comparison:<br/>
<br/>
GetWorkingPlaneN:     WP cen= \{-0.5, 0, 0.5}   WP Nvec= \{-1, 0, 0}   WP Uvec= \{0, -1, 0}<br/>
<br/>
GetWorkingPlaneMat: WP cen= \{-0.5, 0, 0.5}   WP Nvec= \{0, -1, 0}   WP Uvec= \{-1, 0, 0}<br/>
<br/>
Note: The Normal (N) vector in one output is the U vector in the other. The output of GetWorkingPlaneN() returns the correct values as determined by drawing the vectors manually.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please see the attached file. There is a script and stored working planes with a text object on each stored plane. Activate a plane and manually select the object on that plane, then run the script &quot;Show WP Mat&quot; to show the returned values in the Message Window. Note in all cases the N &amp; U vectors are swapped.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the problem has existed since the function&#39;s inception in VW 2011. I have tested this back to VW 2013 with the same results.<br/>

<br/>
On the second (or more) call, GetWorkingPlane() returns (0, 0, 0) for the plane&#39;s center and (0, 0, 0) for each of the rotation values. This describes the Layer Plane.<br/>
<br/>
On the second (or more) call, GetWorkingPlaneN() returns (0, 0, 0) for the plane&#39;s center and (0, 0, 1) for the Normal vector, and (1, 0, 0) for the U vector. This describes the Layer Plane.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
See attached file. In the file there are two scripts, a named Working Plane, and an extruded rectangle with Planar Text on one of its faces. Follow these instruction to reproduce the error.<br/>
<br/>
1) Open file &quot;WP Test v2020.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2) Open the Working Planes palette.<br/>
<br/>
3) Double click on &quot;Working Plane 1&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4) Run script &quot;Show WP&quot;.  Note: in Message Window the second  line shows data for the Layer Plane.<br/>
<br/>
5) Run script &quot;Show WPN&quot;.  Note: in Message Window the second line shows data for the Layer Plane.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Expected Behavior: GetWorkingPlane() and GetWorkingPlaneN() should return values describing the current Working Plane no matter how many times they are called in a script. When GetWorkingPlane() was tested in VW 2009 and VW 2010 it returned correct values for user defined planes on multiple calls, so this is a regression.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe the pdf print is correct, as the viewport before printing has the setting  &#39;project screen objects&#39; checked on in object info palette.  The rendered image of the viewport (not showing the line across door), is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I rated this bug low, because the settings are correct... but it can be a mistake to the designer, if someone is not aware objects will appear after printing.

I&#39;ve seen this problem happen with much simpler cases than what&#39;s described here, but this was the only way I could get it to happen every time.<br/>

This is a regression from VW 2020.

Switch to Top view and set the render mode to Sketch. Everything displays as it should using the default Sketch style and object custom modes.<br/>

Go to Sketch Options. Click the Preview button. The display is correct with the overall objects using the default sketch mode and the objects with custom sketch styles displaying correctly. <br/>

Desired result. The display should always show as if the Preview button is pressed or the view in Top mode when Sketch rendering is selected.

Why is there a difference in animation processing between macOS before High Sierra and macOS after Mojave?<br/>

Clicking the &quot;Play&quot; button in the Animation Path OIP has the following differences:<br/>
[MacOS before High Sierra]<br/>
&quot;Calculating Animation&quot; is displayed in the progress bar at the bottom right of the application window, and it takes a long time to process.<br/>

The progress bar at the bottom right of the application window is not displayed, and the process ends immediately.<br/>

In the Profile group, the original arc node has a planar refID of 1; the one that was copied, then pasted in place has a planar refID of 0xfff..ff. This happens whether paste or paste-in-place is used. When paste-in-place is used, there are 2 coincident identical objects that look different to Purge.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to create object with this problem:<br/>
 # Create an extrude along path (I used a line and a circle, selected both, used line as path object and created extrude along path).<br/>
 # Copy/paste or copy/paste-in-place. Look at the planar ref IDs in the extrude&#39;s profile group&#39;s object (an arc node, in my case). Compare its planar ref id to the one in the original extrude.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Do any operation that requires you to click outside the drawing window (for example choose File/Save or activate the &quot;View A&quot; saved view from the mode bar menu)<br/>
-Now move the cursor back over the drawing window and try a shortcut (for example press the Middle Mouse Button to Pan, or press CTL+Middle Mouse Button to flyover)<br/>
<br/>
Note that this fails. In order to get it to work you have to first left-click back inside the drawing window.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem in 10.14.6 or in 10.15.6 so it looks like a 11.0.x problem (tested on 11.0.1). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also possible that this just happens over VPN and has nothing to do with 11.0.x, though it&#39;s hard for me to confirm with my current setup. I know past new OSX versions have had focus problems so it feels like it could be OS-related...

In the Section Viewport 410 Ansicht Süd, there is a wall that despite the class color / material changes, it remains black. What could be the reason for this?<br/>
<br/>
In the drawing the wall is displayed with its correct color / material, only in the Section Viewport remains black.<br/>

 * Be in OpenGL.<br/>
 * View &gt; Create Viewport.<br/>
 * Click on OpenGL settings within the Viewport creation window. Any changes made in this pop-up seem to erroneously apply to the Design Layer still visible in the background.<br/>
 * For example, changing the Detail level from Low to Very High causes a hang of a few seconds while the higher detail level is apparently cached (unnecessarily).<br/>
 * Changing the other settings such as Edges, Textures, and Color causes the geometry in the background to change as well.<br/>
 * This is all unexpected and unnecessary, since when you hit OK to create the viewport, it&#39;s an out-of-date viewport that must be rendered anyways.<br/>
 * Additionally, when you return back to the Design Layer, the settings you determined for the viewport are now applied to the Design Layer, BUT the Design Layer OpenGL settings don&#39;t reflect that. There&#39;s a mismatch. You have to turn settings off then back on in order for it to be correct again.<br/>
 * This I all shown in the attached screen recording.<br/>
 * A user should be able to change any of the settings in the OpenGL settings window when making a viewport without having to wait multiple seconds each time a setting is changed. There should be no calculations performed at that time. This issue is particularly annoying in files that are even more complex than this, since each OpenGL checkbox might cause a hang of up to 20 seconds in certain files.

Additionally, when the palette tears off and I re-dock it, the other docked palettes are not there anymore. They can be restored by using the pulldown and choosing &quot;dock all palettes&quot;... <br/>

(A path for an animation cannot be closed! Didn&#39;t know that and would want to be able to use a closed path! but this is another issue)<br/>
<br/>

I drew a closed poly line and assumed that I could unclose it from the object info palette - have often done this with polygons but must never have done it with poly lines or not recently because very unexpected behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 and 2020 the poly line&#39;s line disappears and it says it is open<br/>

I went back to previous versions to check what happened there and 2020 did the same but 2019 just refused to uncheck the closed button.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What is happening here?<br/>
<br/>
Even if you change all the control points to &#39;Corner&#39; it still does not behave like a polygon would<br/>
<br/>
Also if you do start with an open poly line it is happy to close it and open it again.<br/>

<br/>
One of our users has a document with an existing font style which, when used in the Design Layers, becomes Unstyled and doubles in size. When this Font Style is used in new documents, the issue does not occur.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached some screenshots showing this behavior, as well as the user&#39;s original file (User&#39;s Original File.vwx) and a new file to test the font styles with (Font Test.vwx).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also including my text file for Tekton Pro, in case we need to install it.<br/>
<br/>
The user&#39;s name is Dennis Fox, and can be reached at dfox@foxdesigngroup.com (in case we need to reach out to him for any further information). I personally have never spoke to any other users who can replicate such an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to look at this. Have a great day! :)

                DOM: Site Protection Server HostID changes
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      There is an improved support traffic based on the Site Protection Server. There are different reasons for that. A higher Number of Site Protection Servers is uses for Licensing and the other reason ist, that the Protection system changed from Dongle/Mac Adresse to Activation Code.<br/>
<br/>
Reported Problems:<br/>
<br/>
The Host ID Changed and there is no Access to the activated Host. There Are different reasons. Some of them are comprehensible others lesser:<br/>
 # User Migrate Site Protection to a new server. It is dealable that the user have to release his license and re-activate on the new server. This ist noch a real issue. We think this acceptable that this needs a new Activation code.<br/>
 # User have another Harddisk connected and mitgrates his system to this new harddist. Not tested, but users reported that they do not have released the license and could not activate with the same activation code. Would be good, Harddisk ID is not used for generating new Machine.<br/>
 # Server is broken and ist installed new with new Hardware. This is dealable (very rarely). We think this acceptable that this needs a new Activation code.<br/>
 # We got reports, that updating from Mojave on Catalina Server needs to release and reactivate license (respectively they did not release). We think this acceptable that this needs a new Activation code.<br/>
 # We got reports, that updating form catalina 10.15.5 on 10.15.6 requires a new activation code (or a License release bevore Update)<br/>
 # Site Protection is installed on a virtual Server. This Servers sometimes are are running in Datacenters. This Systems somehow renew or auto-migrate the server on other Hardware. So they need a new Activation code every two weeks or ever month maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While some points are manageable and and are allowed to stand. Point 5 and 6 are real issues for the customers. Others also come to real issues if Licenses not running (If it is customer&#39;s blame or not do not help if Vectorworks is not running)<br/>
<br/>
If they have an accident with the Site Protection, their Vectorworks Licenses not running and the Office is blocked. We cant help them immediately and we need some hours to get a new Activation code.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly Big customers are using Site Protection server. And the activation System growing to a real problem. Some customers want their Dongle back or asking for a Dongle.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At least we don&#39;t really know how to fix but the actual state is insufficient for our customers and for us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Possible solutions ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1. Taking less restrictive Parameters to generate HostID<br/>
<br/>
2. Linking Activation to a Server so Activations could be reseted Online on a Server (from us directly maybe like E-Serie Activations)<br/>
<br/>
3. Maybe allow an emergency timeout for licenses<br/>
<br/>
4. Possibility to get License directly from the cloud or the internet. Tracking and controlling could keep License secure.<br/>
<br/>
5. Maybe a possibility to create directly an activation code without latency.<br/>
<br/>
6. Or more informations about from what HostID is addicted. So we could make more precise manuals.<br/>

They can only be selected by clicking along the outer perimeter of the object. This makes interacting with them in 3D incredibly difficult. Whenever you grab one to move it, the object BEHIND the Image Prop is selected instead, which is confusing and inconsistent with how other 3D objects work.

In fact, the used local mapping gets ignored. When these ploylines are converted to polygon, then it works. Basically it should work with polylines as well.<br/>

1. Open Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
2. Minimize Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
3. Double Click the Test file to open it<br/>
<br/>
4. Cancel the Conversion to 2021<br/>
<br/>
5. Try to click on the tools or on the drawing, rotate, pan, etc... <br/>
Nothing happens. Acts like an image of Vectorworks, despite being open.<br/>
<br/>
6. Click on the Vectorworks icon on the menu.<br/>
Vectorworks will maximize as if it has been always minimized and now it will work as expected.<br/>

                Question: Unable to open large size files by environments.
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is a question from our major customer.<br/>
They say that when opening files on their server, some people can&#39;t open, depending on the file sizes.<br/>
It seems an error message will shown that says &quot;Internal Error - general failure encountered during disk I/O operation. (Failure on attempt to open file)&quot;<br/>
Around 10MB files, everyone can open. But in case of about 50MB files, 2 out of 4 people can&#39;t open.<br/>
They can open properly if downloading the files to the local.<br/>
<br/>
They are doing tele-working as the countermeasure against the novel coronavirus.<br/>
So, the PC environments are different each.<br/>
And they are using Series G via VPN.<br/>
<br/>
Based on above things, we would like to ask you the followings...<br/>
1) What do you think the cause of the particular 2 people are unable to open large size files?<br/>
2) Is there any time limit or something to open files as a Vectorworks design?<br/>
  (For example, it will show an error message, if you can&#39;t open a file in 60 seconds. etc...) <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We have received a support query regarding the Wall framer where it incorrectly creates the framing when another wall (internal wall) is joined. <br/>
<br/>
We have tested this back to 2019 and is the same in 2019,2020 and 2021. We can replicate this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Please see screenshots from the user and also the test file. <br/>
<br/>
Mark will be adding another test file. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need anything else for your investigations. <br/>

I do not know how to bug list this, because it is not consistent enough, but happens enough to drive me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
So in the three screenshots, are a mix of Roofs and roof faces. 01 was the state of the file when I opened it, you can see the Roof Framing component is showing as wire frame for the lower roof face. I was able to reset the roof face by double clicking as if I was going to edit the shape geometry and exiting the dialog (shown in image 02)without doing anything. This time it corrected the first time, occasionally I do this and the framing fills in, but the tile component becomes unfilled, rinse and repeat until all components are filled. 03 shows a roof, that I selected and toggled the soffit setting (could be soffit, fascia, or attic, it is only about forcing a reset of the PIO)<br/>
<br/>
This was all created from scratch in 2021 over the past 6 weeks, into a default Architect(Imperial) template file. The roof items use the default &#39;Sloped Wood Struct Insul Spanish Tile&#39; roof style. The roofs can be stable, then randomly opening the file something is unfilled.<br/>
<br/>
 I used an Artistic RW Style: &#39;Pencil (Sketch Concept) when only one roof was showing as unfilled and all roof components rendered as unfilled as shown in 04. Making sure all roof components in all roof items are shown as filled as shown in 05.<br/>
 <br/>
Again this is consistently inconsistent, and I cannot isolate it enough to make a real bug report. Because I could upload a file with a &#39;problem&#39; roof and when it is opened it could appear as normal. I cannot record a video because it doesn&#39;t always occur.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>

I was doing my organization nav dialog acceptance test, working with references, when I finished that test and went to close the file I was working in.  Vectorworks just disappeared, and at first I thought I had accidentally closed Vectorworks.  I did look and did find a dump file.  I tried to symbolize it, but it looks like the acceptance test build has not been added to the crash processing system, and Omar(the one who updates it) is no longer with the company, so I am attaching it unsymbolized.  I have not been able to reproduce this crash yet.<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  I was able to symbolize this, and I think also reproduce it.  It is caused by leaving Enscape open and then closing all open files in Vectorworks.

Note that if you right click on the style symbol in the Resource Manager and go to &quot;Plug-in Style Options&quot; from the contextual menu, the class of insertion should be Door-Vinyl. However, when a new door is inserted with this style it is assigned to the Wall-Exterior class.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that when this style was first created it was based on a door already inserted in a wall; the latter was set to the Wall-Exterior class. Other than the aforementioned context menu, I do not see a way to assign the default class of the inserted doors.

Ultimately, I would also like to offer a bundle installer that shows each individual product as installed. <br/>

I have found that I can write to the xml file if it already exists on disk, however, if I write to the xml and it does not yet exist, the file gets overwritten.<br/>
<br/>
My solution in the betas was to create the xml during the add_to_workspace script, but the code does not create the file any more.<br/>
{code:java}<br/>
xmlFile = vs.GetFolderPath(12) + &#39;InstalledProductsManifest.xml&#39;    <br/>
xmlRoot = &#39;/Products&#39;    <br/>
userFolder = -1 # We&#39;re getting the path ourselves    <br/>
global xmlID    <br/>
xmlID = vs.InitXML()    <br/>
success = vs.ReadXMLFile(xmlID, userFolder, xmlFile)    <br/>
if success != 0:<br/>
     success = vs.CreateNewXMLDocument(xmlID, xmlRoot[1:])<br/>
     vs.WriteXMLFile(xmlID, userFolder, xmlFile)    <br/>
xmlID = vs.ReleaseXML(xmlID)<br/>
{code}<br/>
Running this code outside the install process works as expected, but it does nothing in the install script.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
 # Open the attached file [^EthanRoschSlowFile18017 Carto NYC Design 2018.vwx]<br/>
 # When prompted to linked missing reference files, select to relink them<br/>
 # When the file browser is opened, press cancel and then select no to all<br/>
 # Once the file is open, change the default 3D render view to use OpenGL and press num-5 or go to top view<br/>
 # Select the walk through tool then open the document preferences<br/>
 # In the first tab, uncheck use cropped perspective view<br/>
 # walk through the file a little bit and close the file<br/>
 # Open the attached file [^LuisGradient Opacity Control v2019.vwx]<br/>
 # Notice the viewports are missing geometry<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: In other files, the design layer are missing various objects types, like plants, polygons, etc.  Other objects like polylines remain.  The only way to fix the issue appears to be to close Vectorworks and open it again, and not repeat the same steps.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the Plugin Object Style Options<br/>
-Change the Class from &quot;None&quot; to &quot;&lt;Active Class&gt;&quot;<br/>
-Click OK to accept the change, then edit the style again<br/>
-Change the Class back to &quot;None&quot;<br/>
-Click OK to accept the change, then edit the style again<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Class has reverted to &quot;&lt;Active Class&gt;&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens with all plugin object styles, but it only seems to happen when going from &quot;&lt;Active Class&gt;&quot; to &quot;None&quot;. If you switch from &quot;&lt;Active Class&gt;&quot; to another class and then to &quot;None&quot; it works fine.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2021 SP0.

                AHA: Railings can use a lot of RAM (cannot switch to viewport in this case)

</td>

<br/>
In this case the custom cannot switch to sheet layer &quot;Portrait&quot; anymore because of this. To many objects are rendered. And even worse rendered with &quot;shaded polygon&quot;. However, I log this as a bug anyhow. Maybe you see a way to &quot;cache&quot; the railings.. but don&#39;t know what kind of technology is available for this.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Open &quot;Testfile 20200326_01&quot;<br/>
 # Try to switch to sheet layer &quot;PORTRAIT&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you can see this takes very very very long. We know that the amount of railings is a problem and also the chair is not optimized. But the main issue in the file are the railings.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you see a way to optimize railings in the future.

                In Section Viewport, Section Style class is not following visibility settings of the VP

<br/>
You&#39;ll see that I create a Section Viewport and assign one of my own custom classes called *Section Style for the Cut Plane. The Section VP is created and the Cut Plane is shown in Green. As I change the color of that class in Organization, you&#39;ll see the lines changing color as you would expect. However, if I click into the Class settings and turn the *Section Style class OFF, it continues to show in the VP. This time changing the pen color of the class does not change the color of the geometry until I update the VP. An update does accept the proper color, but technically the Class should not be showing at all because it is turned off. Upon converting the VP to a group, the *Section Style class switches to being invisible, and I have to turn the class back on in Navigation to show it (as you would expect)<br/>
<br/>
So it seems that the unusual 2021 behavior is that the Cut Plane class is ignoring it&#39;s Class Visibility setting. Seems like a bug?

<br/>
There were two inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The inquiring user executes &quot;Borrow&quot; button, and the license is automatically returned when the borrowed license expires.  However, when “Return&quot; button is executed at any time, the return information is not reflected on the license administration software of the server machine. If executing ”Borrow&quot; button again, one user will be in a state where two licenses are borrowed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We do not know the cause.<br/>
<br/>
Could you tell me the cause?<br/>

<br/>
One of our VSS customers is reporting regular crashing on their three brand new high spec iMacs (see attached screen shot) with Vw 2020 SP4. A few weeks back I had them turn on verbose usage reports so there should be some crash logs you can view. I have also attached one crash log. Here are their serial numbers:<br/>
<br/>
EFXZCZ-8ZYKC5-ZCZ7Z7-G01QEN<br/>
  <br/>
 EFXZCZ-RZ8KAT-ZWZ3ZR-G01QEM<br/>
 EFXZCZ-JZJK8F-Z8ZMZY-G0ZK07<br/>
<br/>
I have previously looked at their files which don&#39;t seem to have anything that stands out as the cause, but I have attached one to this report. It is quite small and 2D only. Yesterday I suggested to them to change Navigation Graphics to Good Performance, then report back if the crashing continues. I will add a comment to this report if this has made any difference to the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need anything further to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
the import of Cinema 4D textures does not really work. The imported textures are not the same as in C4D. Could you please have a look?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I have no C4D, so I have send you the customer files. But they are close to 4GB. So I send you a download link: [http://downloads.computerworks.de/Import_Cinema_4D_Texturen_Support.zip]<br/>

this is made worse by the fact that all other cameras are disabled at the same time and will no longer respond to DMX.<br/>
<br/>
I think the camera needs a control channel to activate it similar to the relative camera and it would also be helpful to have some sort of camera symbol/object that can be seen in the Vision model to show where the camera is<br/>

Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I am getting similar results as you, but I am not sure why. Initially, the Viewport is blank, which does cause difficulty with selecting and moving. However, I changed my Navigation Graphics and then the Viewport did show geometry. I was able to select the Viewport using a marquee selection, but I was still unable to move it. Once I turn on all Classes and Layers for the Viewport, it seems to work fine. I am not sure what would cause this. It doesn&#39;t appear to be an issue with a Crop, Layer Scales, Visibilities, etc. I would recommend submitting this as a bug on JIRA. I haven&#39;t seen this before.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

3. It will show an empty sheet. Computer Memory will rise to 2,81 GB (see S01.png)<br/>
3.1. Go back to the Design Layer. Computer RAM goes up to 3,04 GB and stays so.<br/>
<br/>
4. Make sure that there are no objects selected and click on &quot;Fit to Objects&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5. We will find that there are 9 AW Camera Objects far from the drawing. See S02.png.<br/>
5.1. Delete the cameras and move drawing to the Origin. Computer RAM now is at around 3,09 GB. See S03.png.<br/>
<br/>
6. If I click Purge, file will freeze and can&#39;t be worked anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the file has many 3D Polygons, but I cant says if that is the cause or what is making the file to be slow and using so much RAM, that doesnt go down until we close the file.

I haven&#39;t isolated the real cause, but so far the constant seems to be opening multiple files at once. Potential issues are that the files I was working on today are have Design Layer Viewports, in them. I will add comments as I find more constants.

<br/>
I should note that I am using Mac Catalina with a 5K retina display iMac.  When I take an older resource that is correct and re-render the thumbnails using Top/Plan and Wireframe mode the loci get large again.  If a coworker on a Windows machine takes one of my files with the large loci and re-renders the thumbnails the loci return to the correct size, even on a 4K monitor.<br/>

Based on both the user&#39;s disposition and comments as well as the contrast between the number of &#39;Begin Session&#39; instances and &#39;End Session&#39; instances in the License Session History, they are experiencing an unusually high number of crashes. 37 in 30 days on SP3. 11 in 12 days since updating to SP4. <br/>
<br/>
On 06/26/2020 he experienced an issue where anytime he opened a file - even a &#39;new, blank document&#39; - crashed his Vectorworks 2020 (then SP3.1). After Resetting Vectorworks Preferences this issue was resolved, but there were many crashes that followed soon after in unspecified circumstances. <br/>

This only happens in some files, though I wasn&#39;t able to figure out what&#39;s causing it.<br/>

I tested this using the newest Escape version (2.80-preview.9+26107).

I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that if the viewport was not updated properly, its view matrix may be desynchronized from its transformation matrix. This may be causing problems with manual transformations of some plugin objects inside the HSVP that rely on correct view matrix.

A customer has made us aware of an issue with some of the lamps in vision. Email from the user below.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Hi Vectorworks,<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to have the Arri LED 360&#39;s (and all the rectangular faced lamps) series represented by a rectangular beam in Vision, currently they open with two circular beams?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Then the user selects both objects and chooses to adjust the size of the objects by typing a new size into the OIP. In this example the user changes the Y dimension and the upper left control point is chosen as the hold point. When change is made the rectangles grow by the dimension requested but in two different directions and only the original object grows relative to the control point selected. The mirrored object grows in the opposite direction.

                Preformatted Room Finish Schedule displays incorrect information
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The preformatted room finish schedule worksheet, when used with the Space tool, populates the material tag number cells with both the material descriptions AND the material tag numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier versions only diplayed the tag numbers. The material descriptions, on the other hand, were (and continue to be) shown in the preformatted room finish legend.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the correct behavior is the one found in earlier versions: the *schedule* should include room number, name, and material tags. And the room finish *legend* should include the material descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, in the preformatted room finish schedule, the cells are too small to include clearly both the material tags and the descriptions (which confirms, in my mind, that this is a bug and not WAD).<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine, whose knowledge of such things exceeds my pitifully small universe of understanding, suggested this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You want to use the SUBSTRNG function in the row formulas. This looks for a delimiter character (in this case the space after the ] ) then returns the text up to that point:<br/>
<br/>
Instead of this:<br/>
=Space&#39;.&#39;Finish Floor&#39;<br/>
use this:<br/>
=SUBSTRING(&#39;Space&#39;.&#39;Finish Floor&#39;, &#39; &#39;, 1)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The attached file has two schedules–one the preformatted version exhibiting the problem; the other with the row formulas altered per the advice described above. The latter indeed shows just the tag itself, as appropriate.

Can you please provide me with the correct link? I&#39;m not sure where it displays in the Vectorworks app (for sure not in the dialog Vectorworks Remote Setup). Maybe this link is not necessary?

Dear Vectorworks Tech Office,<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I’m Zeno Da Ros, from videocom, Italian Vectorworks partner.<br/>
 <br/>
For a learning session to an important client I need to solve relevant problems on the Panoramas and Videos processed on Vectorworks Cloud Services.<br/>
 <br/>
As you can see from the video and from the file of which I am attaching a link, the simple scene is correctly processed on viewports with the dedicated rendering style.<br/>
 <br/>
If we calculate the animation with the Vectorworks Cloud Services, this is not realized.<br/>
 <br/>
There are similar issues with Panoramas and other minor issues that I will share on the Jira platform.<br/>
 <br/>
This problem is of utmost importance because I am in the middle of a training course at an important Italian company known all over the world that needs to learn this method.<br/>
 <br/>
I await your considerations. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Best regards<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Using the reshape tool to drag the ends of the fence to a new location will sometimes realign the texture.  Placing the ends of the fence back to their original location will result in the texture shift, but the results are not consistent.

Note that this causes all the NURBS Surfaces in the array to disappear.<br/>
<br/>
If you convert the symbols to standalone objects inside the Array Items the problem goes away, but there&#39;s a massive performance hit that makes the Surface Array almost impossible to work with for slightly more-complex objects. <br/>

The same thing happened in previous versions.

                Subdivision converted to Generic Solid - File size increases

<br/>
This may not be a bug as such. But I don&#39;t understand why it would work this way at present. <br/>
<br/>
I have a mesh object from SketchUp warehouse, when converting to Subdivision, then generic solid - the file size balloons. <br/>
<br/>
Mesh file size           - 1.9mb<br/>
Subdivision file size - 9.3mb<br/>
Generic Solids.         - 131.mb<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to convert the same mesh directly to generic solid - it does not work but also doesn&#39;t appear with an error messages. <br/>
<br/>
File Attached with symbol. <br/>
<br/>
I currently need to manually simplify other meshes in the file, so i am trying to figure out the best workflow for this &#39;other than the simplify mesh command&#39; As this is a workflow that might benefit Interior designers bringing in lost of mesh files. <br/>
<br/>
If there was a script which could help me simply multiply meshes at once by a percentage. That would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Or is there another process you could recommend? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you

                Question : Selecting multiple structural member objects and entering static text for the material parameter does not replace the same parameter value.

The other structural member objects remain unchanged from the original material parameter values.<br/>
 <br/>
Is this a limitation related to material parameter specifications or is it a bug?<br/>
 <br/>
--------------------------<br/>
*Target function*<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Structural Member tool<br/>
 <br/>
--------------------------<br/>
*Reproduction procedure example*<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
1) Select the Structural Member tool and place three structural member objects in the drawing as an example.<br/>
2) Select all structural member objects.<br/>
3) Select the &quot;Select Shape...&quot; button in the OIP.<br/>
4) Enter any static text for the &quot;Material&quot; parameter and select the OK button.<br/>
5) If you check the material parameter in the structure property in the OIP, only the newly selected structural member object reflects the newly entered material parameter value.<br/>
Note that the structural member objects selected first and second remain unchanged from the original material parameter values.<br/>
 <br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
In the case of parameters that enter numerical values such as &quot;Major Depth&quot; and &quot;Major Breadth&quot;, the same value is reflected in all structural material objects.<br/>
 <br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;12244.mp4&quot; and more files.<br/>

<br/>
In the attached file, omg the Tufted Wall Layer, there is a surface array. There is a NURBS Surface based on an Arc and then Tapered Extruded. On that surface, I have applied a symbol that uses a NURBS Form and a hemisphere object.<br/>
<br/>
So, the command seems to work as regular geometry. Although it does not seem to be rendering forward right now. It has appeared correct.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, I would like to rotate the array object like in the screen grab attached. I might also like to removes some of the Array objects, but the rotation and Clipping to the size is critical. When I rotate in the OIP, I loose the seamless transition. If I rotate the array Object in the edit window all bets are off.

<br/>
This is seemingly a longstanding issue and has been the subject of many posts on the Forum for years: <br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/search/&amp;q=hatch%20texture%20align&amp;search_and_or=and&amp;sortby=relevancy] <br/>
<br/>
See the attached screenshots (in order by date-and-time) and the client&#39;s sample file to appreciate the issue. <br/>
<br/>
*Additional Finding:* As shown in the last few screenshots, only when the hatch &#39;alignment frame&#39; is &#39;snapped&#39; to the edge of the full-colour area of the image preview do the hatch and image align with each other in Hidden Line and OpenGL/Final Quality Renderworks.

<br/>
If I run the VS you can see that all objects will be found except the grade object and the Site Modifiers pio. As these two objects also &quot;run&quot; through the &quot;point&quot; area these two must also be found. What can we do that all objects within this area will be found? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Code:<br/>
<br/>
PROCEDURE Example;<br/>
VAR<br/>
gx1, gy1 : REAL;<br/>
<br/>
FUNCTION DoIt(h1 :HANDLE) :BOOLEAN;<br/>
BEGIN<br/>
AlertCritical(&#39;ObjType No = &#39;, Num2Str(0, GetType(h1)));<br/>
DoIt:=true;<br/>
END;<br/>
<br/>
BEGIN<br/>
DSelectAll;<br/>
ForEachObjectAtPoint(DoIt, 0, 0, 0.0, 0.0, 10); <br/>
<br/>
END;<br/>
RUN(Example);<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also in Mainline with the new function:<br/>
<br/>
gSDK-&gt;ForEachObjectAtPoint it will not work. So this seems to be a problem of the core of this call.<br/>
<br/>
SDK Code:<br/>
<br/>
gSDK-&gt;ForEachObjectAtPoint(allObjects + descendIntoAll + descendIntoAuxLists, WorldPt(0.0, 0.0), 100,  [&amp;](MCObjectHandle h){<br/>
<br/>
    TXString tx;<br/>
<br/>
     tx.itoa(gSDK-&gt;GetObjectTypeN(h));<br/>
<br/>
      gSDK-&gt;AlertInform(&quot;ObjTypeNum =  &quot;, tx);<br/>
<br/>
   *return* *true*;  // continue<br/>
<br/>
});<br/>

This time no folder seemed to appear and was unable to move past that screen. I forced quit and the installer asked if I wanted to abandon the install. The fan is running, but that&#39;s the only indication I have that an install might be happening.

In a perfect 45º ortho view, the lines should be clean, yet there are slight deviations from &quot;perfection.&quot; This comes across as an overall loss of fidelity.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to wireframe rendering, the grid and axes, and tools as well. This could be from the thick lines geometry shader.

-Run the Project Sharing command to convert the file to a Project File<br/>
-In the Resource Manager, browse to the attached folder<br/>

<br/>
Note that this causes the file name to enter text editing mode (it should just get highlighted).<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the process of converting a file to a PF is triggering this somehow. If the file is already a VWXP when you open it, the problem won&#39;t occur.<br/>

This is a regression from VW 2019. The same thing happens going back to 2020 SP0.<br/>

                Site Model: Existing and Proposed Modifiers don&#39;t give desired result.

<br/>
I hope you are all coping with working from home and that you and your family are well.<br/>
<br/>
I have been looking at the use of existing and proposed modifiers on a site model, with a customer.<br/>
<br/>
Existing site modifiers in isolation do a great job. They add features to a site without affecting the cut and fill. However, if the customer wishes to add a proposed modifier, that touches or overlaps a site modifier for the existing site, it does not give the desired results.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached an example which clearly demonstrates this. The modifiers are separated on different design layers, and the model is set to be updated by visible layers only. So, you can turn on the different modifier layers and see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the workaround is to place the existing modifiers into the site model source data. However, they must be ungrouped, and then other source data needs to be edited. I&#39;ve attached an example of this method too.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if this is something that can be fixed, or if it&#39;s something that we will have to live with, hence I&#39;ve filed as a bug. Please give me a shout if you would like to discuss... at my desk!<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe.

Customer complains that the updating takes more than 3 hours each, which in total would be more than 3 days for all the Viewports and Section Viewports.<br/>

After everything is updated and rendered, objects are not shown correctly anymore. Including Camera Perspectives, where the lighting isn&#39;t rendered completely. The render for the lightning starts, but then it simply stops and doesn&#39;t finish.<br/>

User is creating Interior elevations to trace over in 2D (uncertain as to why) but when they edit in place, the lines of the surfaces disappear from view as one zooms in and out and pans while trying to edit the model.<br/>
<br/>
I have done this same set up in a new file with just 4 walls and I see the same behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Is this due to the user creating interior elevations on a design layer rather than a sheet layer?

  -In our customer inquiry record, there are several cases where VW2018 crashed and could not be started, and we recognize that there is a problem.<br/>
  -According to information from our customers, there is a case where VW2017 started without crashing.<br/>
  <br/>
 However, we do not know formal information about whether there is a problem with each version of Vectorworks.<br/>

 So we have a question.<br/>
 Is there any information on whether there is a problem with the Ice Lake CPU for each version of Vectorworks?<br/>
 We want to share that information with our customers.<br/>

Answer from Tech Support:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for file. I am not having any luck importing it, but I don&#39;t get any errors. Vectorworks just hangs for a long time when I try, probably due to the file size. I am not able to open that image in any application that I have tried. It is likely an issue with the image. I don&#39;t see anything other than the size of the file that stands out. You may want to submit this as a bug on JIRA. Our engineering team may be able to determine what the problem with the image is.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Note that NBL door styles are not showing up in the viewport in top plan. 3D view is fine<br/>
Switch to sheet layer in the same file you will see the styles show fine.<br/>
Looks like the problem is the custom door related classes are turned off in DLVP by default. I am not sure this is intended behavior though I believe it is a bug?<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      To reproduce the problem, do the following steps:<br/>
<br/>
1. Activate the Loft Surface Tool<br/>
<br/>
2. Select the first 4 NURBS like shown in the video, from left to right and press enter or on the green checkmark to complete the operation.<br/>
<br/>
3. The Loft Creation menu will open.<br/>
3.1. First curve Reverse direction to the right. click next<br/>
3.2. Second curve is already to the right. click next<br/>
3.3. Third curve is already to the right. click next<br/>
3.4.  Fourth curve Rever direction to the right. <br/>
3.5. See that Select Alignment by Point or by Percentage cant be changed. <br/>
3.6. Activate &quot;Create Solid&quot;<br/>
3.7 Click OK to close Dialog and complete the operation.<br/>
3.8 You should get a result like seen in the S01.png. Which isn&#39;t a Solid.<br/>
<br/>
4. Now, please go to File and Revert to Saved.<br/>
4.1. Do the same steps, but this time with as many NURBS as possible. Seems to exist a limit of 13 NURBS. There are 15 NURBS total in the drawing.<br/>
4.2. Make sure that all NURBS have the same direction and Create Solid selected.<br/>
4.3. Again &quot;Select Alignment by Point&quot; (or by Percentage) isn&#39;t possible to be used.<br/>
4.4. You should get a result like seen in the S003.png.<br/>
<br/>
Important: The NURBS were created from a Subdivision, with the Create Contours Tool. Compare S003.png and S004.png to see the difference.<br/>
<br/>
S003.png shows the NURBS result.<br/>
S004.png shows the Subdivision object from where the NURBS originated.<br/>
S005.png you can see all objects and compare the differences aswel.

-Move its vertices as shown<br/>
-Now select an adjacent object and try to move its vertices so that they snap to the previously-moved vertices<br/>

- Open the attached test file in Vectorworks<br/>

- Set the render settings to the ones shown on the attached screenshot<br/>
- Choose a destination for the output image and click Save<br/>
- Open the destination folder and notice that the placeholder OpenGL image appears shortly afterward, but Vectorworks remains stuck on the Save panorama JPEG file dialog (Mac). On Windows, I don&#39;t see the Save panorama JPEG file dialog at all, but Vectorworks remains stuck not making any rendering progress. If I just start rendering the view in Vectorworks in the same render mode, I am seeing progress as expected. I realize that the Panorama rendering is much more intensive than the rendering of the view, but I wanted to submit this for further checks just in case. I am able to submit cloud rendering jobs with the same render settings and the job progresses as expected, so I suspect that there may be resources limitation on both of my computers, but there is a chance that there may be an issue with the actual process of starting the rendering locally.<br/>

                Column in Wall not working from 2018 to 2021(b3)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      So far I have not found a way to get the Column into the Wall working in Vectorworks 2018, 2019 or 2021 respectively, but I now know how to get failure and success on purpose in Vectorworks 2020 (SP4).<br/>
<br/>
The short of it:<br/>
The bug: you cannot insert the column into a wall.<br/>
Vectorworks (2020) is affected by this bug, if you attempt to pull a Column into a Wall +within the default start document+ _before_ doing the same in a file you saved in a prior session.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To fully understand the scope of the bug, *four runs of opening and closing Vectorworks* are needed:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1st run<br/>
 * start 2020<br/>
 * draw a wall, insert a column into the document, pull the column onto the wall<br/>
--&gt; the column will not go into the wall and the wall doesn&#39;t show the red indicator that it&#39;s possible. :( FAILURE no. 1<br/>
* save file as &quot;not working&quot;, quit 2020<br/>
<br/>
2nd run<br/>
 * start 2020<br/>
 * close start document<br/>
 * open file &quot;not working&quot;<br/>
 * pull column onto wall<br/>
--&gt; it works. :) SUCCESS no. 1<br/>
 * save file as &quot;working&quot;, quit 2020<br/>
<br/>
3rd run<br/>
 * start 2020<br/>
 * draw a wall, insert a column into the document, pull the column onto the wall<br/>
--&gt; as we expect: it doesn&#39;t work. But wait, we now have a working file, right?<br/>
 * open file &quot;working&quot;<br/>
 * pull column onto wall<br/>
--&gt; it doesn&#39;t work. :( FAILURE no. 2<br/>
 * quit 2020<br/>
<br/>
4th and last run<br/>
 * start 2020<br/>
 * close the starting document<br/>
 * open file &quot;not working&quot;<br/>
 * pull column onto wall<br/>
--&gt; it works!<br/>
 * open new file &quot;blank&quot;<br/>
 * draw wall, insert column, pull column onto wall<br/>
--&gt; it works :) SUCCESS no. 2<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought it had to do with the user folder, but it doesn&#39;t look that way. Whether it&#39;s a German or US version doesn matter either and neither does whether you use styles or not.<br/>
<br/>
Please watch the attached video where I go through all the runs in quick succession.<br/>
<br/>
Food for thought:<br/>
In conclusion - insofar the column seems to be working better in 2020 SP4 compared to 2021 b3, this might actually be considered a regression bug.

On Windows, the pane flickers as it&#39;s resized but it doesn&#39;t stretch/distort.

Now sceb.fMenuItemId is 0 for all menu items I chose (and fMenuItemIdStr contains garbage which also looks rather suspect). Somehow Vectorworks loses the ID value or doesn&#39;t pass it correctly. This means that the plug-in can not identify which menu item was selected and the menu is useless.<br/>
<br/>
eventArgs.GetCellMenuItemValue() should of course return a CGSMenuItemValue that has the same ID the menu item had when it was created.

This relates to:<br/>
<br/>
		Vectorworks Enhancement RequestsVE-100654<br/>
Spotlight Truss libraries have to have rendered thumbs and previews without simplified box obscuring<br/>
<br/>
I opened the enclosed library file and seeing no symbols on the page selected all the symbols in the Resource Manager in one of the thumbnail viewing modes and changed them all to right isometric. <br/>
<br/>
+3 observations:+<br/>
1. Wireframe shows corners correctly with no &#39;simplified&#39; outer.<br/>
2. Hidden Line render show some with the &#39;Simplified&#39; outer *and* others not.<br/>
3. OpenGL shows *all *of them with rendered with the &#39;Simplified&#39; outer drawn.<br/>
<br/>
So there is an inconsistency as to how they are displayed whether wireframe, HLR or OpenGL.<br/>
<br/>
I label this &#39;high&#39; because users are now forced to go to the manufacturers website look at a catalogue and work out what symbol to use. Not nearly as easy as looking at a thumbnail and seeing the correct corner straight away.<br/>
<br/>
 Snapshots and file enclosed.<br/>

You might say no-one in their right mind would ever do this. But Murphy&#39;s Law deserves our respect. I&#39;m as uncomfortable seeing this as an option in Vectorworks as I would be seeing an adapter like that in real life.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1) Draw a Landscape Area and apply a plant to it.<br/>
<br/>
2) Make sure &quot;Show Plants 2D&quot; is unchecked.<br/>
<br/>
3) Ungroup the Landscape Area.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When you do this, it looks like it works perfectly up front to continue going as the resulting polygon has the record data still applied so it will still work with your schedules and such. Unfortunately, the ungrouping actually generates a very small Line/polygon that also has the data attached which results in problems with your worksheets.

<br/>
the default values, especially the height, seem to be millimeters. So, when creatimg e.g. a hedge in a document with document units meters, then the height suddenly is 2000 meters. When doing the same in a document with document unit millimeters, then the height is 2000 millimeters which is 2 meters which is correct.<br/>
<br/>
This is low priority. We do have customers which are complaining from time to time. I guess this can be fixed easily.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce (see video):<br/>
<br/>
1) open file &amp; take a look at the Festoon Strings<br/>
 2) double-click the object to get to the network<br/>
 3) change the name of any node &amp; exit script<br/>
<br/>
4) see, how geometry and object position are distorted<br/>
<br/>
Current workaround: change any value in the OIP -&gt; the Object Node will reset itself and show the corrent geometry and palcement.<br/>

 and<br/>
 (b) &quot;Angles are in degrees&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(A) With either 2D vector or 2D point there will always be an error message, because the third component &quot;r[2]&quot; of the vector is used in lines 48 and 50.<br/>
 Also: for planar objects the first two components are never used.<br/>
 (B) Given that the user has to supply a vector, merely writing &quot;Angles are in degrees&quot; is not sufficient to explain what is happening and causes more confusion than necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest removing the 2D parts from the description and adding information, that explains how the vector-components are used for the rotation (in angles).<br/>

                Marionette: Changing the default text font results in the font on nodes changing as well
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      By default Marionette Nodes have a couple different text objects with certain sizes and Arial as default font. After changing the default font to something other than Arial creating or moving Marionette Nodes will result in the text objects on the node using this new font instead of Arial.<br/>
<br/>
Just as changing the default text size doesn&#39;t change the Marionette Nodes&#39; texts, changing the default text font shouldn&#39;t change the Marionette Nodes&#39; texts.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
1) open new file<br/>
2) insert a Marionette Node<br/>
3) Text &gt; Font &gt; choose a font other than Arial<br/>
4) move the Marionette Node you inserted earlier<br/>
--&gt; see that the font of the text objects on the node changed<br/>
<br/>
Just as the default text size doesn&#39;t influence the appearance of Marionette Nodes, so shouldn&#39;t the default text font. (Inconsistency error)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this needs any more explaining, but here&#39;s a good reason the current behaviour is bad: if someone setup a Marionette network with many neatly arranged nodes, this would all become a mess when the font changes, since fonts don&#39;t all have the same properties (height, length, spacing).<br/>
<br/>
When you change the default text properties and then move a text object you had created before, then this text object doesn&#39;t suddenly take on the new default values, now does it?

<br/>
If a user creates their own device but selects to create the device without any in or out connections, the dialog is dismissed and a device is created without any in or out connections.<br/>
<br/>
I think there should be a confirmation dialog to make sure the user wants to create a device with no connections and provide the normal toggle option to not show the confirmation again.

This is because the original extrude within the IFC entity is still using a different class. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Essentially, should the overall IFC entity class apply to all internal objects as well or is this working as designed?

The values are calculated from the unscaled symdef, so DataVis does not respond to scaling of the symbol instance. This applies to overrides for the symbol instance itself, as well as its &quot;children&quot;.

To reproduce: (see video)<br/>
1) open new file in 2020 SP2.2 (530873) or SP3b (532993)<br/>
2) activate the Linear Dimension Tool<br/>
3) draw a dimension<br/>
4) tick the checkbox for &quot;Show Elevation&quot;<br/>
5) tick the checkbox for &quot;Custom Elevation&quot;<br/>
<br/>
6) when unchecking &quot;Custom Elevation&quot; I would expect for only the Elevation text field to become unavailable, but the first checkbox is automatically unticked as well.

Base on my testing, this will only happen when you intially start a new document and you use the tool for the first time in that document.<br/>

Steps to duplicate.<br/>
-Start a blank document<br/>
-Press the &quot;F&quot; keyboard shortcut to lunch quick search.<br/>
-Search the command &quot;Lower Right Iso&quot;.<br/>
-The command is found but notice how it&#39;s showing the wrong keyboard shortcut.<br/>
-It&#39;s showing &quot;Alt+1&quot;, the other command &quot;Lower Left Is&quot; the suggested keyboard shortcut is &quot;0&quot;,<br/>
 which is the command for Top/Plan view.<br/>
-After the first use the Quick Search, the wrong keyboard command will not show anymore.

How to Reproduce<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
When changing the User Origin, the size of the Reference Grid changes between 2D View and 3D View.<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1) Check that the Reference Grid is set to X: 10 and Y: 10 in the SmartCursor Settings.<br/>
2) Switching between 2D View and 3D View does not change the grid size.<br/>
3) Mouse-click the User Origin anywhere.<br/>
4) When switching between 2D View and 3D View, the grid size changed X: 30, Y: 30 at 3D View.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know this is bug or by design.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample10682.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie10682.mov&quot;.<br/>

*Remarks*<br/>
-Same for previous versions. The Support section checked up to v2013.<br/>

Hi Stanislav,<br/>

I don’t think the percentage symbol would be modified in other language, but localizers could decide to use the word instead of the symbol and that text label should adjust to the text length, so please file a bug.<br/>

Save the file with an extremely long title. After that, when I edit it again and try to close the file, the line breaks in the dialog come to a strange position. Also, the title name is cut in the middle, and there is no abbreviation. Is this by design?<br/>

In the enclosed file there are some Renderworks backgrounds and these are not panoramic nor HDRI&#39;s. Just a straight image.<br/>
<br/>
There is no preview able to be made in the Resource Manager which makes it difficult to choose the correct Renderworks Background as the thumbnail is so small - so a preview is needed.<br/>

This is very minor but if you arrange the palettes and save palette positions, on a restart both left and right palettes come up from the bottom a tiny bit. I don;t have Big Sur but a customer called up and complained (!) so I did a movie (edited and I missed the palettes slightly on the right had come up).<br/>

It would be handy to have the current version number visible. The only way to find the version number is to open the app and go to &#39;About&#39;<br/>

<br/>
This is a bit tricky to describe, so I&#39;ve included a video with the process and a sample document displaying this behavior and the resulting label legends.<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine this may be working by design, since it seems to be using the location of the labels as if the lighting instrument weren&#39;t rotated.  (This may also be an enhancement request to change the behavior, if it&#39;s working by design.)<br/>
<br/>
This was reported by one of our users on a call, Peter Leonard (PeterL@uvu.edu). I&#39;m including their information here so I can reach back out to them after this has been reviewed.<br/>

Thank you for your time, and have a great day! :)

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the &quot;non-elevated&quot; file<br/>
-Edit the 2D Component of the symbol<br/>
<br/>
Note that the view gets centered on the symbol contents.<br/>
<br/>
-Now open the &quot;elevated&quot; file and try the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the view gets centered far away from the contents.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the distance that the view &quot;shifts&quot; matches the layer elevation (it shifts 300&#39; on the Y-axis in this case).<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the symbol is edited in a 3D view. You can also see it by editing the 3D Component, switching to plan view, then choosing &quot;Edit 2D Components&quot; from the context menu.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in previous versions.

<br/>
We have a user who has been experiencing Viewport opacity issues. They have this set up by class styles. However, if they override this on the drawing to a number of lines, to change the opacity. This change doesn&#39;t come through to the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
I have tested this in a new file and all seems to work as it should and the opacity comes through. I just can&#39;t seem to get this to work in the user file. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas would be great. I am still trying to work this out but thought it would be great to get your thoughts too! <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>

Please see the video and file from the user. <br/>

Email from user:<br/>
Hi<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m struggling with the opacity of some lines getting transferred through to the viewport. I&#39;m not sure what the issue is.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve changed the style of the lines from the class style of 100% to 25%. This would normally show in the viewport immediately but isn&#39;t. I can only do it by changing the class style in the viewport which I don&#39;t want to do because this will make all the lines in that class 25% opacity and I only want some of them to do this.<br/>
 <br/>
The viewport class settings also seem a little broken as it won&#39;t let me untick the box to unlink the pen and fill attributes without also changing the opacity to 25%.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When opening a file created with Big Sur in Win, the value of the Page Setup may change.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Open v2021 with Big Sur, and create and save (or Export as lower versions)<br/>
<br/>
The value(Horizontal&amp;Vertical) with the Page Setup is [1: 1].<br/>
<br/>
2. When I open it with Win, the value(Horizontal&amp;Vertical) has changed to [1.042: 1.0318].<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* The procedure for reproducing is not clear.<br/>
My PCs experienced the phenomenon immediately after installing VV.<br/>
On the other PC, the phenomenon occurred after repeated reboots.<br/>
<br/>
* Furthermore, if I save it as [1: 1] on Win and open it on Mac, it will be [0.95797: 0.9692].<br/>
* We have not confirmed this phenomenon in the English version yet.<br/>
<br/>

                VectorScript: several Text Style variables not working
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      If I go by the Appendix of the Function Reference, there are 10 object variables, that can be set by using either<br/>
SetObjectVariableInt,<br/>
SetObjectVariableLongInt,<br/>
SetObjectVariableString or<br/>
SetObjectVariableBoolean<br/>
<br/>
So far I have only gotten the Style Name to be set and the font size.<br/>
<br/>
None of these though:<br/>
* Text Style Font Index<br/>
* Text Style Vert Spacing<br/>
* Text Style Style<br/>
* Horizontal Alignment<br/>
* Vertical Alignment<br/>
<br/>
The Marionette script was provided by a customer. In order to control for Marionette bugs I rewrote the script as VectorScript, where I get the same results.<br/>
<br/>
Also (goes for both the VS-Scipt and the Marionette Network):<br/>
To actually see the Style show up in the resource browser sfter running the script, you need to delete an object from the resource browser or change the folder within the resource browser.<br/>
<br/>
Another strange thing is: The Marionette network puts out an object type 109 None. The Appendix does not list the &quot;209&quot;. Why is it &quot;None&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Could the ID of the settings be different from what is written in the Appendix.

 # In Spotlight Preferences, under Parameters, create a New LD Parameter<br/>
 # Select &#39;Pop-up&#39; as type and make a list of choices<br/>
 # Click Ok<br/>
 # Check the box to the right for &#39;Accessory&#39;<br/>
 # Click Ok<br/>
 # Insert a Lighting Device<br/>
 # Click &#39;Edit Accessory&#39; and attach an Accessory<br/>
 # With the Accessory selected, notice the new Pop-up parameter is in the OIP, but the drop down doesn&#39;t contain the list entered.<br/>

Other default drop downs seem to be working in the Accessory OIP and this doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue with the Lighting devices.

1) Create a wall.<br/>

<br/>
3) Select a lighting device with the Instrument Insertion Tool.<br/>
<br/>
4) First click can go anywhere. Second click for pointing the light, click on the midpoint of your wall projection. The lighting device ends up a &quot;lighting device in wall&quot; object and the selection on it is completely wrong.<br/>

I have tested back to VW2019. The graphical result on screen is slightly different, but the exact same overall issue occurs there as well.

On Windows, as soon as you select a dropdown option from the Tool Mode SOD (e.g., an option from the *Text Style* dropdown of the *Text tool*), the Tool Mode SOD will instantly disappear, regardless of the distance between your mouse and the SOD.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac, the Tool Mode SOD will remain on screen, and will disappear instantly when you move your mouse (if you select an option far away from the SOD, e.g., &quot;_Notes 10 pt_&quot; in the dropdown). <br/>
<br/>
I feel the SOD should not be deactivated when a dropdown option is selected. Same for the Resource Selector dropdown: users might still need to go back and pick the tool modes they prefer.<br/>

Only the Folder pane shows this behavior. The rest of the window is opaque not translucent.<br/>

I could not find any other applications that use a Save As dialog box that is not pinned to the window, so I can&#39;t tell if this is Mac OS15.6 standard behavior or a VW anomaly.

<br/>
1. Start a blank file<br/>
 2. Select the _Regular Polygon tool_, by default the _Number of sides_ should be 6.<br/>
 3. On drawing area, activate Tool Modes SOD, modify _Number of sides_ data field to 3<br/>
 4. Move mouse away from SOD, create the polygon in the drawing.<br/>
 * Notice that on Windows, you end up with a hexagon.<br/>
 * On Mac, you get a triangle.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out on Windows, you need to *hit the enter key* to confirm the value on Step 3, so that a triangle will be created. Whereas on Mac, the value is confirmed without hitting the enter key.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should make it consistent. I prefer Mac&#39;s behavior.<br/>

Something that was noticed in a training session . <br/>

When you go into the reshape tool for a nurbs curve, the colour of the icons for X and Y axis are the wrong way around. Does not reflect what is on the design layer axis.  <br/>

 * VW2021 Site Protection Server for Mac specific.<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction procedure:<br/>
 1) Start VW2021 Site Protection Server for Mac.<br/>
 * RLM software version: v14.0 (build: 2)<br/>
 * vektorwrx software version: v14.0 (build: 2)<br/>
 [Reproduced server OS]<br/>
 Big Sur / Catalina / Mojave / High Sierra<br/>
<br/>
2) Start the Vectorworks client, check &quot;Automatically find servers&quot; in the Login Settings dialog box, and click &quot;Login&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3) VW2021 Site Protection Server for Mac is not automatically detected and you cannot log in.<br/>
 [Reproduced client]<br/>
 OS: Windows / Mac<br/>
 Vectorworks: VW2021 / VW2020 / VW2019 / VW2018<br/>
 * No matter how many times we tried, the client couldn&#39;t find the server automatically.<br/>
 * It was useless even if the firewalls of the server and client were disabled respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Postscript:<br/>
Currently, the version of VW2021 Site Protection Server for Windows is v12.2 (build: 2) and it is automatically found, but when it is updated to v14.0 or higher, it cannot be found automatically?<br/>
We are worried about that too.<br/>

We have a user who is experiencing issues with their font reading correctly in 2021. <br/>

The font is Lato. <br/>
<br/>
This reads fine in 2020 however the spacing disappears when the file is opened within 2021. There isn&#39;t a way to get the spacing to correctly show, from what we have investigated. <br/>

Although this could be considered a feature later I think it is unexpected behavior.<br/>

If it were a shape with a fill, such as a Rectangle, when you enter a custom Fill Opacity, the &quot;Use Class Fill Opacity&quot; button DOES uncheck itself, so it&#39;s only the Pen Opacity checkbox that isn&#39;t working correctly.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Toggle the button in the mode bar to enable Working Plane Views<br/>
-Switch to a Front view<br/>
-Now activate the Flyover tool in View Center Mode and do a few flyovers<br/>
<br/>
Note that the view rotation gets centered on the objects, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now switch to Top/Plan<br/>
-Rotate the plan as shown<br/>
-Again switch to Front view (which will now be a &quot;rotated 3D view&quot;) and then do some flyover operations<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the rotation gets centered on some point in-between the objects and the origin (where the temporary Working Plane exists), making it hard to keep the objects in-view.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the file has a modified user origin.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.<br/>
<br/>
This may be related to the bug reported in VB-138866, where switching from Top/Plan to Top view in similar situations also causes centering issues.

<br/>
The command &quot;Unfold Surface&quot; is inaccurate. In the attached file you see, that the value 2 is pretty precise. We think that this precision is enough for production.<br/>
<br/>
But the value 1 is for the production industrie (f.ex. wood work or exhibition industry) not precise enough.<br/>
<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Change the Structural Top Bound to &quot;Layer Elevation&quot;<br/>
-Now try to manually change the Structural Height from 2&quot; to 0&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that you get an alert saying the Structural Height must be greater than 0&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try to change the Structural Bottom Bound to &quot;Layer Elevation&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it just fails with no alert. Technically the reason this is failing is because the change would result in a 0&quot; structural height, so all the user needs to do is enter any top/bottom offset before changing the bounds. Without the alert though it&#39;s not really obvious what the problem is, so it feels like a bug.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

<br/>
If when going from single pane to MV the focused pane is still the same as the single view, then we don&#39;t really need to separate.  We could either not disconnect or maybe automatically reconnect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If when going from MV to single pane the focused view becomes the single pane then for that case too we could stay connected.  If instead the single pane becomes not the focused pane but instead say always the upper-right pane then we would need to disconnect.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess this is because of scene IDs and it is OK if we have to do this but would be better if it could be avoided.<br/>

<br/>
When looking in the &quot;House Light Compare LS Mini 81 - JMR Compared&quot; VWX file, the light is about 29&#39;9.5&quot; from the Photometer. The Photometer reads 3.52 FC. Based on the Mini-Pendant 2019-08-14 2 Page.pdf, that should be about correct (I believe).<br/>
<br/>
When using a Photometric Grid in the &quot;Mariners Church House Lights_LS Mini Replacement&quot; VWX file, Vectorworks will display some points being above 60 FC, but the report from Dialux (Mariners Church, Irvine CA - Photometric Report 1 for 1 Mini Pendant.pdf) seems to show that none of the Photometers go past 40.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any way to check these calculations, and would like to know which measurements are accurate. Any assistance is appreciated.<br/>

This was sent to us by user Jonathan Ramage (ramage.jon@gmail.com), and I was hoping to send feedback his way for an update.<br/>

Steps to create this sheet layer.<br/>
-I create a sheet layer (Cover_View_1) that had an original 8.5X11 page size.<br/>
-Once the sheet layer was created, I created a sheet layer viewport. Since the default viewport <br/>
  was larger than the page size.<br/>
-I change the page size (drawing area) to ASME D through the page Setup.<br/>
-In addition to this I added the a Title Block that is ASME D base and unstyled it.<br/>
-I also adjusted the crop of the viewport then change the scale to 1:100 so the house and DTM <br/>
  can be seen inside the viewport.<br/>
-Notice when I change the Projection of the Viewport to perspective through the Object Info <br/>
 Palette,   the viewport crop will change to almost it&#39;s original page size of 8.5 X 11.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have added a video capture for addittional info.

After working for almost an hour with project sharing and synching with the Vectorworks Cloud Services, the refresh issue for sheet layer viewports becomes more prevalent. <br/>
In the attached video capture I&#39;ve created several sheet layer viewports and submitted my changes and waited for the Vectorworks Cloud Services to complete the upload of my changes.<br/>
Notice the refresh problems when I switch to different sheet layer viewport, I have to zoom/in out to see the changes.

- Select the Text Tool and type some text<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps, we have a timeout in HogNet or maybe it&#39;s a simple bug and HogNet just needs to initialize/memset it&#39;s memory to zero. Hard to say until we investigate more.<br/>
<br/>
A Windows PC and some Hog console (hardware/software) capable of sending HogNet will be required for the testing/implementation of this bug/fix.

<br/>
If an object is assigned a specific sketch style (or non), all components of that object should behave that way. Moreover, sketching a hatch can lead to very slow screen redraws, and we need a way to override the sketch of a hatch. How else if not with the object being hatched?

3. Use Scale Objects Symmetric Factor like its shown in the video.<br/>

- If the value is given bigger than the already existent value, then the Symbol will switch position to Southeast and it will not change scale.<br/>

- If the value is given lower than the already existent value, then nothing will happen.<br/>

<br/>
In Vectorworks Preferences dialog, on Smart Options Display pane, when typing strings into the search field of the SOD quadrant dropdown, &quot;General Options&quot; and &quot;Tool Sets&quot; *always* show up on Windows, even if there are no results.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac, these headers *never* show up. See attached images.<br/>
<br/>
This might be a platform-based thing. I think the preferable behavior, in this case, is you only see &quot;General Options&quot; header along with &quot;Snapping&quot; as an option. Any comments?

In this example you’ll notice that in top plan the windows section lines are thin as they should be when compared to the wall lines that are thicker because they’re represented in section.<br/>
But when you make a Section through the wall and window, the window lines should be represented in view - with thin lines and only the wall lines in section- thicker lines, but both are represented in section - with thick lines.<br/>
<br/>
How can this be changed ?<br/>
<br/>
2 As you can see in top plan, the window on the right has an Interior wall detail with 3 components and this is correctly shown in top plan, but incorrectly shown in section viewport.<br/>
Is there a way to change the top and bottom wall detail ?<br/>
<br/>
If not how is this solved ? By drawing 2D objects in the viewport annotations ????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
-Open test file. file contains a styles grid axis<br/>

-Enable Grid Axis toll and use &quot;Duplicate Mode&quot; then start duplicating the grid axis<br/>
<br/>
-Notice the flash that shows in the previous grid axis when inserting a new one<br/>

-This doesn&#39;t seems to be a problem on Windows, just more visible on Mac. This could be a minor issue though. <br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Set the Nav Graphics to &quot;Good Performance...&quot;<br/>
-Make sure the &quot;Show other objects while in editing modes&quot; pref is enabled<br/>
-Enter the Extrude and switch to Top/Plan view<br/>
<br/>
Note that the grayed geometry shows the building model in relation to the Extrude&#39;s source shape, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now set the Nav Graphics to &quot;Best Performance&quot; and try the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Note that now a bunch of random grayed graphics show.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in previous versions.

In future release, the &quot;ear&quot; palette should be updated so that:<br/>

<br/>
I found that changing the active label legend does not always choose that new active label legend.  <br/>
<br/>
Steps taken<br/>
<br/>
Open Label Legend and choose any legend to be active.<br/>
<br/>
Insert light instrument and that active label legend is applied<br/>
<br/>
Open Label Legend and deactivate current legend and choose a different one.<br/>
<br/>
Insert light instrument and the previous legend is applied<br/>
<br/>
Reopening label legend manager can see that 2 legends are active.  Deactivating one will deactivate both legends.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Workaround<br/>
<br/>
Choose an active legend, and insert a light<br/>
<br/>
open label legend manager, and deactivate label legend and close label legend manager<br/>
<br/>
reopen label legend manger and select new legend to be active<br/>

new inserted light instruments will now have the active legend attached

There is also a lot of problem with grass texture that I will post in another bug, not now.<br/>

Attached is a video that shows both of these issues. You will note that a different message appears when SVP creation is attempted when a SVP is selected on a Sheet Layer vs. when editing that Sheet Layer SVP&#39;s Annotations and attempting to create a SVP. Attached is a screenshot of the message that appears when SVP creation is attempted when a SVP is selected on a Sheet Layer and that also appears when SVP creation is attempted when a Section-Elevation Line already associated with a SVP is selected in the Annotations of a Sheet Layer Viewport. In the case of a SVP creation being attempted when a Section-Elevation Line already associated with a SVP is selected in the Annotations of a Sheet Layer Viewport, the message saying &quot;Please select an unsectioned or horizontal section viewport.&quot; does not make much sense since you are already in the Annotations of a Viewport (i.e., an unsectioned viewport).<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I think the strings related to kSectionErrorWarningStrings that are used in LiveSection.cpp, SectionLine.cpp, and ViewportUI.cpp should generally be examined for consistent use and clearness as part of this bug since the ability to create SVPs from viewport annotations is becoming a more common workflow and the ability to create SVPs from HSVPs was just added for Vectorworks 2021. The strings themselves can be found in &quot;//depot/Engineering/VectorWorks/Mainline/AppSource/Vectorworks.vwr/Strings/4076 Create Section - errors and warning and Misc strings.vwstrings&quot;.

PDF becomes invisible at zoom higher 450%.<br/>
<br/>
I found a similiar Jira report, VB-162142 PDF becoming invisible at about 1500% zoom. It was fixed for 25.0.0.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the PDF becomes invisible pretty earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look.

Refer to the two images below:<br/>
<br/>
*Image 1:* The default spacing between the two radio options is not enough (you can see the datafield enabled by the lower radio option is almost too close to the upper radio option). The spacing looks more adequate on the Mac.<br/>

*Image 2:* The spacing between the two dropdowns will not stay equal on a bigger monitor when the text scale is set to 200%. It looks equal when the scale is set to 100%.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;movie10586_1.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
-In Mac, when “Interior Elevation Viewport” is enlarged, the characters become black solid coating. The others tool’s characters disappear.<br/>
 (Informed VB-167186)<br/>
<br/>
-There are times when characters shrink and times when they do not.<br/>
 When the characters are much,the characters tend to be thin.<br/>
<br/>
-＊Worksheet text hardly disappears at the same magnification. But when the characters are much, they tend to be thin.<br/>
<br/>
-I haven&#39;t seen all of the tools, but there may be more.<br/>
<br/>
-This problem is a shaky.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open a blank file<br/>
-Activate the User Origin tool and click anywhere<br/>
<br/>
Note that the dialog appears with the &quot;Disable dragging for the user origin button&quot; option enabled. Because of this, the User Origin tool will now be disabled and will show an error on the next attempt in any file.<br/>
<br/>
This option was disabled by default in past versions so it seems like enabling it could cause confusion.  In order to use the tool again the user would need to know to go to the User Origin dialog and disable the &quot;Disable dragging...&quot; option.<br/>
<br/>
The wording of this option (and its help text) are also kind of confusing. The tool doesn&#39;t actually require &quot;dragging&quot; or &quot;click-drag&quot;, you just click to activate the tool and then to place the origin, so it&#39;s not really clear that this option disables the tool entirely.

Basically, there should be a way to have the fields rotate with the device, but still maintain their orientation. It seems to work better if I just rotate the device manually instead of focusing it.

After the plan rotation, the internal origin marker changes the position in the file, whereby the coordinates remain<br/>
I attached the file and a movie, to show you what happens.<br/>
My steps: reset the rotation and locate the internal origin in the file<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Delete the Bitmap object<br/>
-Activate the Render Bitmap tool with OpenGL and a DPI of 300 or so<br/>
-Draw a marquee as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that the resulting image shows two copies of the objects, one of which is flipped (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it might be Mac-only.<br/>

The same thing happened in VW 2019, but I don&#39;t see this in VW 2018.

The layer scale in the view bar looks like a input field, but is not editable. You can mark the layer scale but not edit.<br/>

Please also note: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-128599<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this is a bug or it just has to do with the fact that the project is huge. However, I think it is worth to analyze what takes the time when updating the references in this file. The customer complains that updating the references takes more than one hour. Well, to be honest it does not take that long. We did several tests on different computers (files were locally stored) and it is between 20 and 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
We would appreciate if you could analyze the process when updating all the references and  maybe you find a hint what takes that long.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1. Download &quot;Archive_01&quot;, &quot;Archive_2&quot; and &quot;Archive_03&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[https://cloud.vectorworks.net/links/11eac117c178c2fca50a0e4ea18416f9/]<br/>
<br/>
[https://cloud.vectorworks.net/links/11eac117cb437f0ca50a0e4ea18416f9/]<br/>
<br/>
[https://cloud.vectorworks.net/links/11eac117d230ac4aa50a0e4ea18416f9/]<br/>
<br/>
The files are huge therefore you get 3 archives.<br/>
<br/>
2. Copie all files in one single folder. The references are relativ already.<br/>
<br/>
3. To be able to reproduce the problem you have to change the following files first. See attached image. Open all these files, add a rectangle to it and save the file.<br/>
<br/>
4. Open &quot;1602_1 GR-SN gesamt_ohneSchnitte.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5. Update all the references in this file<br/>
<br/>
As you can see it will take between 20 and 30 minutes depending on your computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are in risk in this office and already log VB-17200. This is the reason why I log it as high.<br/>
<br/>
The customer is willing to buy new computers, a new switch and also a new server (MacMini at the moment :)). They actually don&#39;t want to switch. Therefore we are happy if you could analyze the the steps and maybe you find a reason why it takes that long. I mean, your answer of course could be &quot;the files are huge and we cannot optimize the process&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note: We did not yet convert them to 2021.<br/>
<br/>
Any info are appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
PS: I know that the files are huge. If you have troubles just let me know.<br/>

                Updating references during file open although auto. Update is turned off
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      A few days ago we went to a &quot;confidence&quot; mission to a customer with 15 seats. They mainly complain about &quot;performance&quot;. I have to say that it is a pretty complex and huge project containing multiple buildings. We already were able to figure out different issues which are causing performance problems and told them to change the setup and their work-wlow slightly. In addition they are also upgrade their Macs and server as well.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately they already bought some ArchiCads to start with a new project. They were afraid that Vectorworks is not able to handle big files. The good thing is that they give us a chance to prove that Vectorworks is capable to handle these kind of files.<br/>
<br/>
One thing we are currently analyzing is the file opening time and the time that is needed to update references. Both take a lot of time. Here the challange:<br/>
<br/>
Although all references are set to &quot;Save referenced cache to disk&quot; and &quot;auto. Update references&quot; is turned off it takes pretty long to open the &quot;main&quot; file (7min. 30 sekonds). We deleted all the &quot;sections&quot; in the file &quot;1602_1 GR-SN gesamt_ohneSchnitte.vwx&quot; and are also sure that no section is references into this file because we know that this cause slow downs.<br/>
<br/>
We are wondering why we anyhow see the message &quot;Updating References&quot; for a long time when opening the file &quot;1602_1 GR-SN gesamt_ohneSchnitte.vwx&quot;. This is probably the main reason why the file opens pretty slow.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to analyze with your possibilities why the file opens so slow and why the references are updated although we turned &quot;auto. update of referecnes&quot; off?<br/>
<br/>
Currently we fear that the sections in the source file are updated too and therefore the target file takes that long to open. But it is a guess.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 1. Download &quot;Archive_01&quot;, &quot;Archive_2&quot; and &quot;Archive_03&quot;<br/>

<br/>
2. Kopie all files in one single folder<br/>
 3. Open &quot;1602_1 GR-SN gesamt_ohneSchnitte.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you will see you get the message &quot;Updating references&quot; which takes a long time. We are wondering why?<br/>
<br/>
Can you please analyze what exactly happens during file opening and if there is a way to optimize this? This is an office where we are in risk (14 seats) and therefore we log it as high.<br/>
<br/>
PS: You can also open &quot;1602_1 GR-SN gesamt.vwx&quot; this is the original customer file. But this one still contain some NOT referenced sections.

                Marionette: Debugging inside object node freezes VWX
    </p>

I have used debugging inside object nodes successfully but it started freezing the application at one point. I am not sure if it is something to do with sheer size/complexity or an actual issue with my wiring. <br/>
Please enter the object and switch the Marionette tool to debug mode. Click on any wire. The highlighting appears and it freezes up.<br/>
I also noticed that I am *sometimes* getting a lag when wiring inside objects. I have not noticed this with v 25. I am attaching a short GIF showing the issue. Note that the spinning ball was not captured by screen recording so the effect is not as apparent. The lag is visible though. Not sure if this is related, just mentioning it in case it is important.

<br/>
1) When switching active from a design layer to a sheet layer.<br/>

3) When creating an object in the annotation mode.<br/>
<br/>
In VW2018 or earlier, we don’t see this problem.<br/>
This seems to occur when there are plural viewports on a sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
What we have tried...<br/>
1) Switching “Navigation Graphics” setting to “Best Compatibility” in Vectorworks Preferences.<br/>
2) Disabling “Show other objects while in editing mode” in Vectorworks preferences.<br/>
But, it doesn&#39;t improve.<br/>

Could you look into about this problem?<br/>

Exchanging BCF files is thus nearly impossible, but for just very few comments. This is one floor, what would it last if it was more, (as it always is)?

                                            <td class="description">      VW is takes an enormous amount of time to do a full spell check of the attached file ultimately resulting in having to force quit the application.  During this spell check process it would take approx. 3 minutes to change one instance of a word and as much as 3-5 times that to execute a &#39;Change Al&#39;l or &#39;Ignore All&#39;.  As the process progressed it got slower and slower to where even ignoring a single instance would take minutes on occasion.  This same instance of spell check ran for two days before I eventual got a Mac out of application memory error and had to force quit VW without it ever completing the check. <br/>
<br/>
I also tested spell check on this document for each of the areas (text blocks, symbols, records, worksheets and viewports) individually.  Each one ran fine until I got to checking Records. This seems to be the problem area.  Running spell check just on records performs better by itself at first but then suffers the same fate of slowing down to the point of having to give up.  I ran this process for 3 hours and never reached the end.  It again followed a progression where changes to a single instance of a word would eventually take about 3 minutes on average and using the &#39;Change All&#39; or &#39;Ignore All&#39; would take exponential amounts of time.<br/>
<br/>
I also suspected that project sharing might play a role even though there were no other users with anything checked out.  I saved the file as a regular vwx file type and tested this again.  The results were a little better but it still took about 1.5-2 minutes when trying to make any single instance word corrections.  Using &#39;Change All&#39; took proportionally longer as well.  Ignoring words seemed to be quicker but overall it was still too long.<br/>
<br/>
I have not had the chance to convert this file and test it in 2021.

                                            <td class="description">      Well, this is actually not a bug. But we got complains that the drawing speed in Vectorworks 2020 is slower than in 2019. We report this again because customers are sensitive about this. Of course there are a lot of things in 2020 which are much faster. But as you know, the discussion is always about the problems and not what is better :). We also see that the drawing speed has changed over the last view versions. Of course the application is more complex today and you can do a lot more. But we anyhow think that a noticeable slowdown from one version to a new on is not &quot;optimal&quot;. Therefore we hope you can analyze the following slowdown from 2019 to 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Watch the attached movie first<br/>
 # Open Testfile &quot;import dwg v2019&quot; and reproduce the problem in 2019<br/>
 # Open Testfile &quot;import dwg v2020&quot; and reproduce the problem in 2020<br/>
<br/>
You will realize a noticeable slowdown when creating objects.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I did not tag this as &quot;CW_HighPriority&quot; or &quot;QRT&quot; because the problem occurs in big files (a lot of objects) only. But I think you should have an eye on this one anyhow.

One attempt I saved the imported file in 2020 and exported to 2019.  The file is much easier to navigate and manipulate without issue.  Able to marquee large areas of the design layer without any hang up.<br/>

I see that this is no issue in 2021 either.

<br/>
+I included two different Vectorworks files:+<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Lighting Plot&quot;* (created myself clean from an 2020 SP3 build, 8MB)<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;My Big Festival Gig 2020&quot;* (came from VB-167265 - Lighting device redraw, 103MB)<br/>
<br/>
From the times below, the large file clearly took longer to complete this action on both OS.  Both files took longer on MacOC than Windows. <br/>
<br/>
*The Schematic View I used is on Layer SV for both files.*<br/>
<br/>
*+Windows:+*<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lighting Plot&quot; Schematic View  - 1 minutes 30 seconds<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My Big Festival Gig 2020&quot; - 4 minutes 30 seconds<br/>
<br/>
*+Mac:+*<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lighting Plot&quot; Schematic View  - 2 minutes 40 seconds<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My Big Festival Gig 2020&quot; - 14 minutes 20 seconds<br/>
<br/>
I conducted this same round of testing in 2020 SP2, and it definitely took longer to conduct this action as well as moving and creating Schematic Views.  So, there is an improvement over all.  &quot;My Big Festival Gig 2020&quot; took 19 minutes to change color on Mac and on Windows it took 8 minutes.<br/>

Doing a select all or deselect all is fairly fast. Adding or removing a light to the selection, however, takes a fair amount of time to process. The more lights I have selected, the longer it takes.

Message from the user:<br/>

As describe in our conversation, the principal issue is very slow selection, lots of lag and a degree of freezing of the program when trying to manipulate simple lines / polygons. This make the program incredibly slow, frustrating to work with and difficult to control. As discussed the below link is for a download of a sample set of files we have this issue with, but it is not exclusive to these files and is an issue generally. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1938_C_GA        This file created in vw2016 worked without any significant issue, certainly not the lag in selection, movement &amp; without the program freezing – these issues are present in vw2020.<br/>
<br/>
                                The issues were experienced both on the new PC with windows 10, and on the old PC which runs windows 7 and has no issues with the files in vw2016<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
28 High Street   This file was created in vw2016 and has experienced the same issues as above, and the file size is significantly smaller / less layers etc.<br/>
<br/>
                                The issues were experienced both on the new PC with windows 10, and on the old PC which runs windows 7 and has no issues with the files in vw2016<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Priory           This file was created in vw2020 and only contains a few imported dwg / dwg from pdf, there are a lot of lines but we did this type/level of survey import with vw2016 with no issues.  <br/>
<br/>
                                The issues (same as above) were experienced both on the new PC with windows 10, and on the old PC which runs windows 7 and have no issues with the files in vw2016<br/>
<br/>
                                The main imported PDF file is also contained.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The issues were experience in when running files on the local machine and on the network alike, with WFH we have generally not been using the network so I doubt this would be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need any further information, I have tried vw 2021 now with the last file and its hard to tell if it is an improvement on 2020 so far but its still the same problems.

When we checked the activity monitor while VW is does not have the external GPU enabled it seems to be using the integrated one. When we turn on the external one it stops using both.

When working on either Vectorworks 2021 or Vectorworks 2020 on a Mac mini (2018) with a sonnet eGPU Breakaway Box 650 plus a Radeon Vega 64 graphics card, I had Mojave installed originally on this Mac but have had to upgrade to Catalina 10.15.7 (19H2) due to other software compatability and now Vectorworks no longer works correctly with the eGPU connected and the Prefer External GPU ticked originally this worked on the older OS with prefer external gpu ticked and increased the speed of what it Vectorworks processes but now with the prefer external ticked Vectorworks lags and goes really slowly even in a blank file and is more noticeable on projects. I have included my system report in the test file attachment, I have also wiped the machine and done a fresh clean install of the OS and Vectorworks and still the slow down is so noticeable for now I have unticked prefer external GPU for now.

<br/>
*Strictly confidential.  Do not even use this as an example of what not to do!*<br/>
<br/>
I attach the original 3d and 2d survey from a survey company that uses vectorworks 2013 as far as we can tell, although it looks like the attached started life before 2013, and even before 2011 since the file was originally named with &#39;v2011&#39; at the end.<br/>
<br/>
This file was stupidly used by my client as the basis of their design model, converted directly to 2019.<br/>
<br/>
The file demonstrates many issues, and notwithstanding the complete lack of care and lack of coordination between 2d and 3d, the junk in the file, some of which we don&#39;t even think was authored by the surveyor, makes it even more challenging to determine why the 2019 conversion is now crashing on open and/or on save.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things wrong with the file it is difficult to explain but hopefully you will recoil in horror, or quiet admiration acknowledging that to get it so wrong takes some effort!<br/>
<br/>
We aim to update the surveyor to the latest version or at least explain that if he wants the work he has to be able to work in and supply 2019, or later models to his clients, since the model is going to be used as the basis of the Architect&#39;s model and the model must not be converted from an earlier version.<br/>
<br/>
A short statement to the effect that &#39;we do not recommend converting from previous versions because of x, y, z&#39;, would be useful, e.g. because the wall technology changed between version a and b, etc.<br/>
<br/>
TBH the file behaves better in 2021 but we have not been able to use the file for any sustained period in 2021 because my client is using 2019.  We have suggested updating to 2021 but this would introduce a further conversion of the model from an unknown version, to 2011, then 2013, then 2019, and then 2021.  Something is bound to break.<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome a critique of the attached file as a warning to all vectorworks users to keep current and only use one version of the software on any one project.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been in contact from a customer that is have unworkable slowness in VW 2021 when working on, what seems to be text heavy files.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These files have been tested on our computers and are working fine without issue. The customer has three licences with three computer. Two are Mac OS High Sierra and the other Catalina. The file works without issue in VW 2021 on Catalina. However, when the file is working on VW 2021 on High Sierra the issues happen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When panning they receive a spinning wheel. When typing new text, this is extremely slow and takes a while to catch up. They have no crashing, just total slowness when what looks to be working with text.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have;<br/>
 * Reset user folder<br/>
 * Ran repair<br/>
 * Updated Vectorworks<br/>
 * Uninstalled/re installed<br/>
 * Validated fonts on the Mac<br/>
 * Checked the energy saver settings<br/>
 * Tried moving some on the text to a new file<br/>
 * Changed navigation graphics<br/>
<br/>
After all these tests the issue is still there. I did a comparison with my Mac and the customer Mac working with High Sierra. His Mac is newer and has better spec, apart from maybe the processor so this shouldn&#39;t be an issue. The anomaly in this issue is the Mac OS is different.<br/>
<br/>
I have tested Vectorworks 2020 on the computers running High Sierra and the file has no issues.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached one of the customers computer spec and a file. If you need anything else please let me know. The customer is very un happy with how the upgrade has gone.

-Open the test file and set the back ground render to &quot;Shaded Polygon No Lines&quot; then update teh section via the OIP<br/>

-Note this take s a while<br/>

-Set the background render to &quot;Final Shaded Polygon&quot; from the OIP<br/>

It would be a good idea to speed the delay when the user switched between render modes to start the &#39;next&#39; render.

<br/>
What he want to do is to integrate a Revit Exported IFC File into his Vectorworks Modell. So far the IFC can be imported and VW 2021 can handle ist pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as we have a section viewport through this IFC geometry, Memory fills and HDD fills also. Maybe the Amount of Poly-Faces is just too big or there is another issue we can not find. I still search for a Workaround. So good possible I will deliver further Informations.<br/>
<br/>
Attached to this report:<br/>
- IFC File &quot;2011_Roesslimattstr_39_HG.ifc&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It is a huge number of Objects in the IFC, so we could say 30000 IFC Object are 30000 IFC Objects and please search another Workflow.<br/>
Unfortunately I also tested this with ArchiCAD 24. Import also takes some Minutes (Faste as in VW but still 10 Minutes). After that I have horizontal Sections on the Floor Structure and after creating A Section after some seconds the section was created without any tweaking.<br/>
<br/>
My approaches in Vectorworks:<br/>
<br/>
1. Tried to seperate the Meshes. If I hide all Meshes Section takes 50 Seconds which is all right. But Half of IFC are Mesh geometry.<br/>
I used a little Marionette Script for that.<br/>
<br/>
2. Simplify Mesh would help but we are not able to manually simplify 30&#39;000 Mesh Objects. Is there a Sript command for the Simplify Mesh?<br/>
<br/>
3. Maybe open Polys in Meshes are an issue. I also not was able to test this.<br/>
<br/>
The ground bottleneck here is the performance of the hidden Line rendering. Just one Design (Tested Layer &#39;DA&#39;) Layer with Hidden line takes very long (I aborted this test don&#39;t know).<br/>
<br/>
What would help:<br/>
<br/>
1. Integrate this Kind of geometry in your performance optimization tests for future Versions.<br/>
<br/>
2. For this specific Project/Customer I need a workaround. I am searching on different directions:<br/>
1. Simplify Geometry with a Vecorscript (can you help?)<br/>
2. Simplify with an external Software (did not found anything yet)<br/>
3. Workflow adaption (wether we like or not). How coordinate the Design with the IFC Geometry. And How create Documentation of the Building contains Technique geometry based on IFC Data.<br/>
4. Filter Objects (Script which search Objects and informations and delete them or set to differenc classes)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I start four documents in VW, the used RAM from VW grows up from ~1.1GB to max. 23GB. The flow of the Performance be using VW is fine but when I close all the four documents, the used Ram sinks to 8.6GB and stops there. <br/>
Is it a memory leak or have VW a use form the rest Ram in the cache?<br/>
I attached the files and two screenshots from my RAM activities.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for a feedback.<br/>

It should recognize the selected object(s) instantly.<br/>

Instead it can take several seconds to never.<br/>

As a work around I have resorted to copying the selected objects. This causes the OIP to be forced to identify and load the object(s) information.

<br/>
What I posted there:<br/>
<br/>
I can confirm the delay when working with the document. From what I see there, you have either imported the DWG in an already existing Vectorworks document, or have updated it later adding more staff. Or you might have imported multiple DWG files - probably 267 according to the number of Design layers?<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the things, which I found:<br/>
<br/>
- The document contains nearly 4 735 000 objects, screen plane;<br/>
<br/>
- Created symbols are 97623; There are also lots of groups;<br/>
<br/>
- Imported hatches are actually groups with lines - Vectorworks imports hatches as hatches, does not decompose them - so probably this is how the DWG file has been exported by ArchiCAD;<br/>
<br/>
- Seems that dimensions are also presented as groups of lines and text - by default we import dimensions as dimensions, except if the linear scale parameter is different than 1.0 or you have explicitly chosen to import them as groups;<br/>
<br/>
- There are lots of classes and sheet layers;

                VW Slow Responding File / Migration
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there, <br/>
<br/>
Would you be able to take a look at the file attached. We are finding it ticky in finding why its so slow.<br/>
<br/>
We received this file from a user, finding it difficult to work on the file due to slowness and response times of simple commands. The file has become worse over time and is now in a very slow state. <br/>
<br/>
The file originated from a 2017 file, this was then saved and migrated to a 2020 file. <br/>
<br/>
The user has mentioned it slowed down a little after a DWG import however not to the state it is in now.<br/>
<br/>
Simple commands as changing layers, turning classes on and off, Select All, cause Vectorworks to become unresponsive. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing to Purge in the file and from what I can investigate no Origin issues.<br/>
<br/>
The next step for us is to import the layers separately into a new file to see if we can narrow this down. But I wondered if you could take a look also. <br/>
<br/>
The Layer Details is very heavy with Geometry, we are thinking this might be the cause, but we are still investigating. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you require any more information. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your help!<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen

I know this document contains an exceptionally big amount of 2D information, but I guess version 2020 should handle this at least as smooth as older versions.

<br/>
1. open the attached file.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of the video: The &quot;open file&quot; process will last 3 seconds, after this 3 seconds we can see the drawing area. Afterwards, it is needed more 9 seconds for the file to completely load and to be workable.<br/>
<br/>
At minute 1:01 of the video: we can see the drawing being fully selected and then an attempt to move the Tool Sets Palette. By doing that, for the next 24 seconds we can see the drawing being loaded.<br/>
<br/>
In general zooming is also slower than expected and that can also be seen in the video.<br/>
<br/>
When switching all Line Types to Solid, the Performance behavior improves significantly. That is also shown in the video.

<br/>
Our customers which use interiorcad, have the problem, that the geometry of the drawers leads to a performance problem with SL-Viewports in &quot;Dashed Hidden Line&quot; renderings. We are also in contact with extragroup. Is it possible to analyze the performance slowdown and to give us feedback which objetcttypes have a better performancy in combinaton with dashed hidden line? Or is the object type no matter, because the drawers are simply to detailled?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The customers Vectorworks 2020 isn&#39;t completely buffering at every movement but is seeing some slowness (spinning wheel) after some time. Normally, when using push and pull or placing objects from resource manager. The resource manager seems &#39;better&#39; after a reset of user folder.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have managed to capture the slowness in the video attached, although this doesn&#39;t happen after some time in the video, this does happen sometimes very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have tested the file on my computer and I have no issues with the file. The file is clean and seems as though it shouldn&#39;t have any issues.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The customer is becoming more frustrated with Vectorworks as she has brought this new super computer and is still getting slowness in 3D. The customers 2019 is also slow. The customer is becoming less satisfied with Vectorworks as she keeps encountering slowness which is affecting her work.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps I have tried:<br/>
 * Uninstall/re install<br/>
 * Repair<br/>
 * Rest user folder<br/>
 * Reset RLM cache<br/>
 * Changed navigation graphics<br/>
 * Latest service pack<br/>

This approach works if the associated Vectorworks object has been drawn on the Z plane and extruded in the Z axis. ( See eg 04 in the file for a successful example ). <br/>
<br/>
However, if the associated object is instead, drawn on the Y plane ( ie from front or back view ), then the IfcOpening fails when exported and reimported back into Solibri.<br/>

This has been puzzling users for a while and has taken us a while to track this down, but hopefully this file documents the issue. We can add an explanatory movie if that would be useful.

We are not sure if this is related to the previous QRT which had corrupt walls - however, we have run the script provided by the QRT team to try and fix this prior to export. The IFC file is being taken into Navisworks and Revit. When we query the GUID of the items in Revit, and then run a search for the same GUID in the IFC file using Text Edit, we can see that the GUID is indeed there.<br/>
<br/>
A further complication is that the same objects seem to be being filtered out by Solibri - as a similar GUID search yields no results.<br/>
<br/>
The IFC file provided by our customer is attached as are a number of screenshots. Here are some examples of GUIDs from the problem items.<br/>

<br/>
Is it possible to tell from the IFC file whether these walls are corrupt? Is it possible that Solibri knows they are corrupt and is filtering them out, but that Revit/Navisworks is simply converting everything it sees? And if so - is it possible to locate these walls in VWX.<br/>

<br/>
The order of Data Fields of a Record Format in the Data Mapping Dialog is not the order of the record format. It&#39;s alphabetical instead of the order of the record format.<br/>
<br/>
After a few days working with the Data Mapping we should from my point of view have both orders enable.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      We have multiple users now coming back to us with issues that when they close down files it freezes the screen on Vectorworks and it seems whatever they would do on the file the changes are applied on to another file in the file tabs. Impossible to change active file. Vectorworks eventually crashes or needs to be restarted anyways as it completely locks the application. Resource manager shows a wrong file as active file when brought up. Design layer screen just gets stuck and freezes, but tools can still be selected. At the moment we only seen Windows computers have this issue. <br/>
<br/>
We created a new user account for user. Set up Vectorworks there and requested not to install anything else while testing. User used VW for a week and found the issue happen again. <br/>
<br/>
User bought and set up a new computer for himself and installed windows from scratch. The computer is completely different. Same issue. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have updated graphics drivers. Computer dxdiag file attached. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Looking into this further we noticed that user is now and then opening old files. This user used Vectorworks 11 files. We have information that this is happening on all new files as well. My thoughts are that this could be related with something in the resource manager as it seems it does not switch the active file when highlighted so it could be related with old resources. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As we had this issue with new files i suspect users might be using templates with old objects migrated from year to year. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just for the record and users request we had him testing the license on a different serial number. We used an Eval temporary license. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.

Despite the PIO uses this same tile, the orientation of the tile within the PIO does not match the orientation of the tile in the wall in the viewport (but it does in 2D plan, see construction layer). This looks very ugly and should be fixed.

In the attached file this takes my machine 3.5 minutes to complete, then the dialog closes and I can resume working. <br/>
<br/>
No changes are required to the dialog before closing it. Clicking the OK always causes a screen redraw. At the very least, the dialog should close BEFORE the screen is redrawn. Ideally, if you do not change any settings and click the OK button, no screen redraw should occur.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking the Cancel button works as expected with the dialog closing and no redraw occurring. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1) Before opening the attached file, set VW PREF Navigation Graphics to *Best Compatibility*. <br/>
<br/>
2) Open file &quot;Wafer Chip2 v2021.vwx&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3) Open the Document Preferences dialog – under menu *File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Document Preferences...*<br/>
<br/>
4) Click the OK button to close the Document Preferences dialog – no need to change anything.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Dialog box remains open while screen redraws. In this file it is a long time to wait for the dialog to close.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe this is a regression, as redraw times used to be so much faster that I never noticed this behavior before.<br/>

The symbol &quot;82 van der Rohe Barcelona chair detailed&quot; seems to be the cause of this slowness. If I delete this symbol from the RM, updating the viewport happens at a normal speed. This is strange, because these objects are hidden behind a wall anyway.<br/>

Jeroen,<br/>
I see now what you are referring to. I would recommend sending this as a bug with specifying that symbol. I know in the past we have found some bugs associated with some library symbols that have since been resolved. This is the first time I have seen it with this chair.<br/>

I managed to get a sample of the crash log when VW was in the Hang state. Maybe the log has clues as to why this happened?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps that lead to the crash<br/>
<br/>
-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
-From the navigation palette, make &#39;Floor 1&#39; the active layer and set layer options to &quot;Active Only&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the Stair in the basement, maybe you can change the treads texture with a different Material then close the Stair Settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
-Perform the &#39;Revert to Saved&#39; menu command<br/>
<br/>
-This is where VW hangs. Not a consistently reproducible bug, although I saw it twice with this file. <br/>

<br/>
The *Unrotate 3D Objects* command returns any 3D object that has its own coordinate system to its upright position. Use the command to rotate symbols, extrudes, multiple extrudes, and sweeps so that they align with the world coordinate system.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been informed that this commands sets the rotation back to match the coordinate system in the file for the 3D object. The concept is “to restore the orientation of the 3D object” in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend changing the command to *Restore 3D object orientation* to match its original meaning and to help improve the localized names.<br/>

For testing, please put attached plug-ins Fenster CW and Tueren CW into your plug-ins folder (Mac, 26.0.x, Debug version). When launching VW, Open file &quot;Tür 2020_sb.vwx&quot; and convert it to VW 2021. Respond to debug warnings by &quot;Don&#39;t show this one again&quot;.

To reproduce, in each version, try to quickly click-drag on the Group to move it.<br/>

Note that this works fine in 2019 but usually fails in 2020. In order to get it to work you have to click, then hold for a second or two, then drag.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this is happening because the interactive drag preview is trying to show more geometry in 2020.<br/>

The attached video shows this, and please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.  Thanks for your time, and have an awesome day!

Watch the attached video and then use the attached file to replicate this issue. Please note that the Section Viewport on Sht-1 and its Layer visibilities are what I would expect to see for both workflows shown in the video. While the video only shows this occurring when creating a Horizontal Section Viewport, the issue exists for any type of Section Viewport.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make sure the &quot;Working Plane Views&quot; view option is active (button in the mode bar)<br/>
-Rotate the plan as shown<br/>
-Now switch to any 3D view<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Current Plan Rotation field in the mode bar still shows the plan rotation angle, and the Current View menu shows an option for &quot;Rotated Top/Plan&quot; (letting you easily return to a rotated plan view)<br/>
<br/>
-Now switch back to un-rotated Top/Plan and enter the Group<br/>
-Again rotate the plan and then switch to 3D<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Current Plan Rotation field shows 0.00º, and if you expand the Current View menu it fails to show the &quot;Rotated Top/Plan&quot; option. At this point if you want to return to the rotated plan view you need to set the angle again.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens inside symbol edit modes.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

Note that the display doesn&#39;t update in the top-right pane until it&#39;s made active.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen with 2D objects.<br/>

The same thing happened in VW 2019 and VW 2020, but I don&#39;t see it in VW 2018.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens with &quot;Best Performance&quot; Nav Graphics.

-Deselect all objects and change the document&#39;s default pen attributes<br/>
-Now resize or reshape each object<br/>
<br/>
Note that the interactive preview for the Polygon/Polyline uses the document&#39;s attributes instead of the object&#39;s attributes. I don&#39;t see this with any other object types so it only seems to affect polys.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

<br/>
On quick inspection, Vectorworks 2019 launches, however has screen redraw issues.  When first launching 2019, there&#39;s no drawing area until you zoom in/out.  Drawing a rectangle is fine, until you move the rectangle to a new location.  You have then zoom in/out again, to see the new location of the rectangle.  I tested on two different Big Sur computers, just to make sure it wasn&#39;t a low grade graphics card issue.  I also tried all three Navigation Graphics options with no improvement.<br/>

<br/>
I tried both overloading  OnBeforeDispatchEvent and creating a custom handler (see code fragments below), but nothing helped.<br/>
<br/>
To me it looks like a bug in VWDialog class or the dialog framework. THe messages are simply not dispatched to the handlers.<br/>

Both of these files have Multi-View enabled. If I disable Multi-View it freezes consistently but doesn&#39;t crash consistently (though it does crash sometimes).<br/>

I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it looks like Mac-only.

The website works just like the UK mapping websites in that you search for your site and then lock in the co-ordinates - pay - and a PDF version of the map is issued (generated from digital vector information).<br/>

All Architects in Ireland would use the OSI service as there is no third party mapping sellers unlike in the UK.

<br/>
The attached .vwx file has an Extrude object, which the Boundary Box is not in the expected place on the right side of the object. Instead of that the Boundary Box is much longer than the object itself.<br/>
<br/>
In 3D everything seems to be normal, but in 2D this problem is visible. We can see the blue points of the boundary box being much further than where the object ends. Even after trying to reduce the Boundary Box size, its not possible to keep it at the size of the object, since it goes again back to its &quot;stretched&quot; position. Shown in the Video.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a possibility to fix this or a workaround for this problem?<br/>
The extrude object was created in Vectorworks.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Drag the objects to a new location<br/>
-Convert the objects to an Auto Hybrid using default settings<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Generic Solid, Fillet, Chamfer, and Shell objects all show their 2D graphics in the wrong location.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this problem will always happen with these four object types, even if they&#39;re the only object in the Auto Hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2020.

                Invisible Groups are Selectable When Unified View &quot;Display Screen Objects&quot; is Disabled

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the Unified View Options dialog and disable &quot;Display Screen Objects&quot;<br/>
-Now draw a marquee over the area where the Screen objects were<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Group becomes selected even though it&#39;s invisible. <br/>
<br/>
Technically Groups can contain both Screen and non-Screen objects, so the Group itself isn&#39;t on the Screen plane, just the contents. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why the Group remains selectable. Ideally VW would recognize that all of the contents are hidden and would make the Group un-selectable, similar to how Groups work when all of the contents are in invisible classes.<br/>
<br/>
The attached screenshot shows an example from one of our users where their setup caused this problem to show. <br/>

The same thing happens in previous versions.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Launch the Mosa browser<br/>
-Change &quot;Set Application&quot; to &quot;Wall&quot;, &quot;Surface&quot; to &quot;Unglazed, and &quot;Sizes&quot; to &quot;Single Sizes&quot;<br/>
-Choose &quot;Blue&quot; as the Color, then change it back to &quot;All Colors&quot;<br/>
-Expand the Grid Pattern menu<br/>
<br/>
At this point the browser should only list patterns that are available based on the selected options, but it seems to show all of them. For example if you choose the &quot;GR019-001&quot; pattern it says &quot;No patterns found&quot; and the &quot;Surface&quot; menu becomes blank. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t really clear to the user at this point that they would need to change the &quot;Surface&quot; option to &quot;All surfaces&quot; in order to get the patterns to show again, so ideally the list would only show patterns that are actually available.<br/>

If you use a script like &quot;SetScale(50)&quot; in combination with a Saved View, the script runs before switching the active layer.<br/>
From my point of view these order is wrong. In the attached file you can see, that depends of the active layer the Script of the Saved View change the layerscale of Design-Layer 1 or Design-Layer 2<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the Hardscape and activate the Reshape tool in the first tool mode<br/>
-Draw a marquee around a few of the vertices, then press the Delete key to remove them<br/>
-Undo the delete operation<br/>
-Switch back to the Selection tool<br/>

Note that &quot;Beta Undo Alert 4&quot; shows in the message bar.<br/>

The same thing happens with other path-based plugins (Slabs, Spaces, Massing Models, etc) but I don&#39;t see this with regular polys.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make sure the Flyover tool is set to use &quot;View Center Mode&quot;<br/>
-Activate the Edit Subdivision tool in Transform Mode<br/>
-With the Edit Subdivision tool is active, press CMD+Middle Mouse Button (CTL+MMB on Windows) to activate the Flyover tool in boomerang mode, and do a few flyovers<br/>
<br/>
Note that the view centers on the Subdivision object, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now click-drag on any face/edge/vertex and begin moving it<br/>
-While the operation is active, again do a Flyover using CMD+MMB<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the flyover centers on some random point, making it difficult to keep the Subdivision in view.<br/>
<br/>
I see the same problem in VW 2019 but not in VW 2018.

Debugging revealed that EListBrowserDirectEditType::QueryItemValue message is never sent to the dialog when the list is created. Only if the user clicks in the cell, the pattern popup opens and QueryItem handler is called. This should have happened before so the list browser&#39;s cell is actually filled.<br/>

I think the same bug also happens for other cell types like hatch, tile or gradient menu.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Rotate the plan -30º<br/>
-Click-drag the top-right corner of the poly that&#39;s outside of the containers<br/>
-While dragging, hold down the Shift key to constrain the object&#39;s aspect ratio during the resize<br/>
<br/>
Note that this works fine when the object is outside of a container.<br/>
<br/>
-Now enter the Group or Symbol<br/>
-Again resize the poly while constraining the aspect ratio<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the resize gets constrained to some random area, causing an unpredictable result.<br/>

The same thing happened in previous versions.
