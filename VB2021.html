The tool just doesn&#39;t work on the objects. It doesn&#39;t even show the correct AMTool mode.<br/>

                Question : There are cases when “Export FBX(3D only)” is not executed on the number of 3D objects in the file.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Open the 0208sample.vwx file in Vectorworks and try “Export FBX(3D only)” command.<br/>
If failing to export FBX for the first time after starting Vectorworks, check if the same error as the FBXerror.png file is displayed.<br/>
This error is displayed when closed Vectorworks or opened Vectorworks again.<br/>
Therefore, execute “Export FBX(3D only)”, and if the file is not created, exit Vectorworks once.<br/>
In addition, once this error is displayed, no error may be displayed from the second time.<br/>
In that case, try restarting Vw or the machine.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Also, if the sample file can be exported correct, copy and paste the objects in the file, increase the number of objects, and then execute the export to see if the problem can be reproduced.<br/>
<br/>
-When I verified the export several times in my machine, the number of objects that could be exported sometimes varied.<br/>
(Example: In some cases, the number of 3D objects in a file is about 60,000 and cannot be exported, or in some cases it can be exported up to nearly 100,000 the next day.)<br/>
<br/>
-At this time, the conditions under which export FBX cannot be executed are not clearly known. <br/>
<br/>
Is this by designed? Or is it a bug?<br/>

Use the reshape tool to modify the object and time how long it will take to complete the operation. Follow the screenshots to see how I do it.<br/>

Used to be like 13 seconds process from the mouse click until the rendering is completed.<br/>
<br/>
Right now is more like 29 seconds and that&#39;s more than twice the time that used to be. I know there are changes in the rendering but it&#39;s a massive difference. Let me know if this will be the new baseline time or it&#39;s an actual performance issue <br/>

To reproduce, open the file in each version and update the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, note that the default crop (which is used when there&#39;s no user-generated crop) fails to account for the Walls (see attached screenshots).<br/>

This may be related to the T02171 task.

Attached is a User Log from a Customer that has random crashes with Vectorworks when doing basic actions such as rotate, zoom, pan, switching between layout levels regardless 2D or 3D. Customer has written that it has about 4 crashes a day.<br/>
<br/>
Its specifically with 2020 and normally I shouldn&#39;t create a report for an older version, but we request help to find what could be causing this problem and to be sure it might not happen with the actual version as well in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The Customer uses an iMac 27&#39;&#39; 2019 with Fusion Drive.

Tech support tells it can be because Vectorworks runs out of memory because the DWG is too big. This might be the case indeed, but in that case Vectorworks should give an error and about the operation without a crash.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Answer tech support;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I load the ciB VO file into autodesk viewer I see many models / plans all over the design layer. It could be that there is too much on 1 design layer over a vast distance and the computers runs out of memory and crashes. My PC and Mac both crashed as they tried to import this file.<br/>
<br/>
Have they asked the Cad user to bind xrefs into the file before sending? Have they asked for the CAD file to be broken into smaller bites? Like less plans per design layer?<br/>

 * Crashes every time. <br/>
 * All crashes so far have occurred when converting Vectorworks files created for use by the Interiorcad plugin. <br/>
 * The User Folder is ~ 7.5 GB, due to the quantity and size of Interiorcad files. <br/>
 * Batch Convert also crashes after handling almost exactly the same number of Vectorworks files. - This makes me suspect a resource management problem (in the software, because the hardware is top-of-the-line: 16 core 3+ GHz CPU, 64 GB RAM, 16 GB VRAM with RTW2080 and very recent graphics card drivers). <br/>
<br/>
We need to know why Vectorworks is crashing so we can create a solution. <br/>
<br/>
It would be most helpful to know if it&#39;s a Vectorworks bug or a condition of the Interiorcad-Vectorworks files. i.e.<br/>
 * Too many files, or <br/>
 * One or more files are too big, or <br/>
 * Files contain data that doesn&#39;t convert. <br/>
 * File contains illegal characters (etc). <br/>
<br/>
Crash .dmp files are attached. Currently we are waiting for the user to upload the 2020 User Folder and a Dxdiag. Once done you can access them here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aoam0ovhlz18q9g/AAA8gK6sTFJGQDbNasPma4Yda?dl=0

here the new Plug-In &#39;electrical installation tool&#39; from Computerworks. There are styles in the tool that are nested several times. The Eltrical-Item Style is in the ElectricalComponent Style. The ElectrcialComponent Style is in the ElectricalObject Style. The goal is to get the IFC default mapping for the electrical installation tool. <br/>
<br/>
The IFC-DataMapping is done by the &#39;Electrical Item&#39; and the &#39;ElectricalComponent&#39;. <br/>
There are no IFC data attached to the &#39;ElectricalObject&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
If I export this as IFC like this, nothing is exported. What am I doing wrong ? If I do it right, how can VW Inc help me to make it work? <br/>
If you need further information. -&gt; Here my Mailadress: rthomet@computerworks.ch<br/>

-Create a PDF from a vwx file on the Vectorworks Cloud Services Website.<br/>
-Open the Publish menu of Vectorworks, select &quot;Store and Process on Vectorworks Cloud&quot; in &quot;Storage and Processing:&quot;, and select &quot;PDF&quot; in &quot;Publish to:&quot; to execute.<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction example:<br/>
1) Upload the sample files &quot;Viewport_updated.vwx&quot; and &quot;Viewport_not_updated.vwx&quot; to the Vectorworks Cloud Services Website.<br/>
2) When opening the two files in Vectorworks, make sure that the only difference is whether the sheet layer viewport is updated or not, and the Image Prop display in the viewport is the same.<br/>
3) Create a PDF from each file on the Vectorworks Cloud Services Website.<br/>
4) When checking the created PDF, the Image Prop in the viewport is displayed incorrectly in the PDF created from &quot;Viewport_not_updated.vwx&quot;. <br/>

Others times the viewport just renders completely black, and the black area extends well-outside the viewport&#39;s crop (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
If I export to VW 2021 and try there, I see the same black viewport and crop issue, but I don&#39;t see the system crash.<br/>

If I change the Shaded detail to &quot;Low&quot; the viewport works fine.<br/>

When I try this on Windows 10 the result is slightly different. I can see the rendered model, but there&#39;s still a black area that&#39;s shifted way to the left (see second screenshot).

How is it possible that a big presentation I have worked on for months is no longer in the VCS Presentations part of the VCS account &#39;ozcadtraining&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
I have not deleted it, and no one else logs onto that account. The strange thing is that I noticed an old 2 slide show presentation that was for our Spotlight template that I deleted when SP3 came out here, has come back! The presentation that is no longer there was 25 boards and some tours. It was called &#39;Spotlight Demonstration&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The presentation was working after SP3 came out as we released a new Spotlight template that had a 3 slide presentation with a link to the bigger demo presentation. We were testing and using and sharing successfully with no problems. I have not touched this since Easter and  now it is gone!<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to restore a lost presentation. Nothing in the trash, history or time machine back ups. Of course this might be user error but at the moment I am 100% I did not delete this presentation. Help please!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Instead, his renderings show Redshift not paying attention to non-repeating material tag values.  This means Redshift doesn&#39;t show non-repeating image textures or non-repeating decals correctly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We will try to get Maxon to get Redshift to pay attention to these parameters.<br/>

I am attaching the original user&#39;s file, which you can use if you want to try rendering in VW2021. The 2022 file version is saved on the sheet layer where the crash occurs.

When trying to render the viewport locally, Vectorworks 2022 crashed about 2-3 hours into the rendering.<br/>
I tried rendering on VW 2021 as well, and the rendering progressed for more than 6 hours, (after which I stopped it ). Based on this, I believe this crash is a regression with VW 2022.

With VW2021, I am able to update both viewports without a crash, so I think this is a regression.

It seems that the error did not occur until about mid-October, so it may be related to the recent version upgrade of VECTORWORKS CLOUD SERVICES DESKTOP APP.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, I will attach the error &quot;VCS Publish error.png&quot; when the customer executes the Publish function of Vectorworks.<br/>
By the way, it seems that you can upload files directly with WEB PORTAL. State at that time &quot;Upload in WEB PORTAL.jpg&quot; is attached.<br/>
<br/>
Customers also say that such errors do not occur on networks that do not go through a proxy server.<br/>
In addition, a similar error has been confirmed on the network via our company&#39;s proxy server, and just in case, we will attach the &quot;DxDiag.txt&quot; of the PC confirmed by our company.<br/>
<br/>
Would you please let us know what the cause and solution are? <br/>

                                            <td class="description">      We&#39;ve had reports now from:<br/>
adam.chekir@designexpress.eu and another co-worker<br/>
lars@capture.se<br/>
<br/>
What we know:<br/>
-These were clean installs, no Migration Manager involved<br/>
-Appear to be laptops only at the moment?<br/>
-Multiple displays are not involved<br/>
-Users appear to be up-to-date with OS and video card drivers<br/>
- Adam Design Express:  If I rename Spotlight.www to Architect.www within the application folder, VW will load the spotlight workspace at launch giving me a way to access to my dedicated workspace.<br/>
- Adam Design Express:  If I save the palette positions, VW will accept to build a new workspace within my user folder.<br/>
- Adam Design Express:  If I want to rearrange any palette in my interface VW will crash to desktop<br/>

<br/>
Hardware - Lars Wernlund<br/>
See attached:  LarsDxDiag.txt<br/>
<br/>
A few .dmp files from Lars Wernlund are attached (Lars_VectorWorks Crash Dumps.zip), however, I was unsuccessful symbolizing the crashes.  The .dmp files seem a lot larger than usual also.<br/>
<br/>
Lars Wernlund recently added:<br/>
If I .. <br/>
- launch and give VW a chance to load and settle down<br/>
- grab the following divider (Resize.png) and drag to the left<br/>
- VW crashes instantly as I release the mouse button and it starts adjusting the sizes<br/>
- Following this I can start VW again without problems.<br/>
<br/>
We asked Adam Chekir, if he experienced the same, as noted above by Lars:<br/>
Yes that’s it.. I issued the same crash with adjusting the size of the tools palette.. You can also see the crash happening when you try to change the size of the main application window by dragging the bottom left corner when it is not full screen.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed  that on a working computer the screen flashes to black at a certain step of the process. On my faulty machine I do not see the black flashing screen. It seems that the crash happens at this moment. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m about to change our german workspaces for 2021 SP3. Unfortunately there is no export datasmith listed in the workspace editor on windows. Mac is working fine. In the english 26.0.3 (587753) Master Files it is the very same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Please correct this for the oncomming SP3.1.<br/>
<br/>
Without this we cannot release a german 2021 SP3!!!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Hello,<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to check if there is any issues with permissions or security is to make a new user account on the machine and try to install it again. If it works, there is some kind of permission or security issue on the users account. Otherwise, it may be a network related issue which would need to be corrected on the network of the user.<br/>

Thank you,<br/>

                Vectorworks 2022 SP0 614805 Crashing every time palettes resized
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I’ve recently installed Vectorworks 2022 SP0 on Mac and Windows. On Windows only, I&#39;ve experienced repeated crashes *every time* I try to adjust the margins/width of docked palettes. A customer (also on Windows 10) has reported the same behaviour. (I was adjusting docked tool palettes on the left side, the user was adjusting the width of the docked Object Info Palette on the right side). Her Vectorworks also crashed when we tried to change from Workspace &#39;Fundamentals ANZ&#39; to &#39;Landmark ANZ.&#39; I&#39;ve since spoken to a different customer using 2022 SP0 who has no such issues. <br/>
  <br/>
 I just experienced another crash: Vectorworks 2022 opened with the main window at a smaller-than-usual size. After double clicking the window header to maximise the window, Vectorworks crashed about 2 seconds later. As this relates to window proportions I expect the cause of these crashes to be the same or related. <br/>
  <br/>
 I’ve also experienced a crash on Windows just by opening a file, via File &gt; Open… but I suspect on this occasion I just got to this menu command after maximising the window and before it crashed. <br/>
  <br/>
 *History so far:* <br/>
 My first installation of 2022 SP0 I did with antivirus (Windows Defender) turned off. <br/>
 After issues I have tried the following remedies:  <br/>
 * Restarted computer.<br/>
 * Uninstalled, then reinstalled leaving Windows Defender on. Then restarted. <br/>
 * Tried two other workspaces (three total). All crashed once selected. <br/>
 * Tried removing existing 2022 User Folder and generating new one. <br/>
 * Installed the latest graphics card driver (only one month newer than my existing one). Then restarted. <br/>
 * Created a &#39;New&#39; workspace, quit Vectorworks, removed all the other workspaces from the Program Folder. Still crashed when adjusting or docking palettes. <br/>
 * Did a clean installation of the same (latest) graphics card driver. Assigned Vectorworks 2022 to dedicated graphics card. Restarted again. <br/>
 * Creating a new, unedited Workspace, then putting it in the Program Folder&#39;s Workspace folder and removing the others to constrain Vectorworks 2022 to use it on launch. - No crash like the other workspaces, but when I adjusted the docked tool palette width, it crashed. So seemingly not due to workspace files. <br/>
 * Checked permissions of Program Folder and User Folder. Compared to 2021 folders, they all look normal. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing has worked. I&#39;ve never encountered anything so absolute in a new release and a fresh installation. <br/>
<br/>
*I&#39;ve attached:*<br/>
 * a fresh Dxdiag<br/>
 * the InstallerLog.txt<br/>
 * a screenshot of the Windows Update History and<br/>
 * a screen recording. - The recording shows how simply adjusting the width of the docked, Basic tool palette crashes Vectorworks and the (possibly related) second issue: Major graphical lag when using 2D tools. - This reinforced my suspicion of the graphics card driver.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a Windows update is responsible…<br/>
  <br/>
 *Is this a known issue? And are there any known causes? What about a fix?*

<br/>
here&#39;s a file from a customer. Customer switched his project from VW2021 to VW2022.<br/>
In Vectorworks 2022 thing&#39;s do look messy. But that is not the bug. The customer could repair this on his own. But the customer complains that the file (25 WP LEY.vwx) crashes every one to five minutes. The layer in question is &quot;GR DG&quot;. It occurs on five different Windows PC.<br/>
We tested the file here at ComputerWorks, but there a no crashes. Only the file looks messy, objects are displaced.<br/>
Of course application support has been deleted in order to see if this is the problem.<br/>
I send you the CrashDump file. Unfortunately I cannot read it. Maybe you can figure something out.<br/>

The behavior I am seeing is not consistent at all. Ine time, the server reports that Vectorworks has crashed within a minute or two of rendering. Other jobs have gone for many hours without much progress being reported. This morning I had a job that has been running for 15 hours and it was reporting that is rendering the 11-th frame. It seemed like it was stuck.<br/>

Not sure the provenance of the attached file from VB-179491, but it triggers this assert on open.  All it&#39;s doing is trying to move a kFieldClass to a kFieldClass.

+Update from customer:+<br/>
 <br/>
Crashing is still an issue, although I have worked on another project which was not crashing, so it makes me believe it has to do with OHTs file size and complexity. <br/>
 <br/>
It seems like the recurring crashing happens when I delete symbols if that helps you direct the engineers. I have been deleting some of the unitised panel symbols and replacing them for 2D groups. If I select, delete, paste 2D groups or symbols it seems to be crashing immediately. <br/>
 <br/>
I tested a different computer yesterday, and the crashing happened again within 2 minutes of opening the file. <br/>
 <br/>
I am now working again on my computer OMIMAC048 and the crashing is still happening, but I’m trying to avoid working on the facade as much as I can so I can advance with my work on other things.

Two main categories:<br/>
1) CSGTreeHandler::RecalcBoundsAndCube (this bug)<br/>
2) Shell code (another bug using this attached file)<br/>
<br/>
1) Likely expected with Wall Re-Eng project. Did we expect the hit on bounds recall for walls? Perhaps 2021 used cached composite surfaces to extract bounds/Cubes more efficiently? This SEEMS a major performance penalty - we are not in a wall reset context - we are simply extracting bounds. GSGs in 2021 did not play such a application critical role. Perhaps we need to cache more info to make up for slow CSG?

<br/>
The attached image tries to show the &quot;chunk&quot; of time spent in Shell code as we switch between saved views in Nav palette.<br/>
<br/>
The three images try to capture the cycles being spent. This bug is about the 25% time item.<br/>
<br/>
Questions: Is this as we had in 2021? Can we explain why this time is being spent?

The file becomes unresponsive and eventually results in a force quit.<br/>
<br/>
I left the file running for about 1.5 hours and had to force quit.  You can see it is not a very large file at all.<br/>

Customer is unable to move forward with their work.<br/>

The file was originally created in version 2020 and was brought forward into 2021 - just some background information.

I will be working, mostly on 2D drawings, and a circular snap preview (as shown in attached screenshot of a frozen VW) will generate, and then suddenly I am frozen. and a force quit is required.<br/>
<br/>
A couple items of note, this is not all in the same file. It is not consistent, so I can have these snap previews generate and not freeze VW.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it doesn&#39;t seem like VW is completely frozen, but working in the background. See attached Activity Monitor screen shots taken about 10 minutes after VW has locked up. Also if VW is in the background, and I click on it, it doesn&#39;t immediately come into focus, but after a delay it will become the frontmost application, but still locked up. I have waited up to about 20 minutes, without VW unlocking itself, so I do not know what its state would be if it was allowed to complete what it seems to be chewing on, if that is indeed the case.

However, when pressing the update button, and waiting, she was directed to a location to download a newer version and a newer version was not automatically being downloaded. We tried pressing the Update button a few times, with lots of time in between.<br/>

Ultimately Nicole had to manually visit the VCS site to download a new version of the VCS app.<br/>

- Open the attached test file<br/>
- Select the viewport on Sheet 25 (sht-25) (the file is saved on this sheet layer) and start updating the Viewport.<br/>
- Vectorworks will crash after a few minutes of rendering (7 minutes or so).<br/>
- So far, I am able to reproduce this when running a Publish job on the Cloud (Windows-based), as well as locally on my Windows computer. My Mac is already 1 hour into rendering and it hasn&#39;t crashed yet, so I am marking this as Windows only based on my observations so far.

User indicates closing and reopening the laptop&#39;s lid, restores functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Josh Peizer found some interaction with Apple&#39;s System Preferences Battery settings to introduce the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to duplicate randomly on:<br/>
Macbook pro debugging machine (touch bar, newer) 1 <br/>
Monterey 12.0 Beta 10 (21A5552a): <br/>
vnc://pc102247.nemetschek.net/ <br/>
<br/>
I was unable to find the magic combination that would reproduce the problem every time.  In some cases having the Battery option, &quot;Automatic graphics switching&quot; on and &quot;Low power mode&quot; off, would duplicate the issue.  Some times having both options turned on would duplicate the issue.  However, if you tried to launch Vectorworks multiple times, it might fail the first two attempts and succeed on the third, as seen in the attached video.<br/>
<br/>
-Try combinations of Battery settings (Automatic graphics switching and Low power mode)<br/>
-Restart the computer<br/>
-Launch Vectorworks<br/>
-Attempt to us the main menu in Vectorworks<br/>
-If it doesn&#39;t fail, modify your battery settings and repeat the above steps<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
In working with a user from the public forum having the issue, this was their feedback after suggesting modifications to their Battery settings.  As noted above, I had mixed results.<br/>
<br/>
 - I turned OFF the &quot;automatic graphics switching&quot; and then the menu is working correctly !!<br/>
<br/>
- I turned ON again the &quot;automatic graphics switching&quot; and then the menu is working correctly !!<br/>
<br/>
 - I restarted the machine and with the &quot;automatic graphics switching&quot; still ON, the menu is dead again.<br/>
<br/>
 - I turned OFF the &quot;automatic graphics switching&quot;, restarted the machine and then the menu is working correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll leave OFF the &quot;automatic graphics switching&quot; at the moment, until next SP will be released.

                Marionette: wrapping named (negative) int/real nodes with strange results
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
Here are some highlights:<br/>
a) wrapping a named int node with a negative causes the node to subtract the given value from 65536. If the int node had -1500, afterwards it will have 64036.<br/>
b) wrapping several real/int nodes with the same name, the OIP outside the wrapper will show the correct values (minus case a)), but when going inside the wrapper, the values are not correct anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is the file shown in the video.

To reproduce (see video):<br/>
 1) open document „Improper-delete-call.vwx“<br/>
 2) run Marionette Wrapper<br/>
 3) close document (select either &quot;Don&#39;t save&quot; or &quot;Save&quot; - it doesn&#39;t matter)<br/>

Also: when commenting out<br/>
<br/>
{{vs.ResetObject(wsimg)}}<br/>
<br/>
(in line 118) of the last node (sName zu hTextur) before running the wrapper, makes it so the error message does not appear when closing the document.<br/>

Reproducible in WV2020, VW2021SP3 and SP4b<br/>

I attached also another file with which I tried to simplify the customer&#39;s Marionette Wrapper. But no luck.

Every time I try to import the enclosed worksheet (Layer Object Count Wsheet) in the file ‘Jayden Sutherland - ASO_FOFO21_v2_v2022’ it crashes 2022.<br/>
<br/>
It’s as if it is calculating the number of objects just on import. When trying to make the worksheet within that file the same thing happens - spinning wheel for 20 mins and I give up. I had to make the worksheet outside of the file but I can&#39;t import for it to calculate.<br/>
<br/>
There are 1,021,598 objects in the file and I was hoping the worksheet could quickly identify the culprit layer where the big number of objects are on but it seems too much to calculate in a worksheet. <br/>
<br/>
Using Custom Selection I can the the number of objects immediately so it is surprising it gets stuck when in a worksheet?<br/>
<br/>
Hence this report.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

This issue was reported by a user during the Vectorworks Open House event. The user thought the cloud was not producing correct results when he publishes his file to a PDF while his local computer managed to generate the PDF correctly.<br/>
I did some testing locally and discovered that this is not actually a Cloud issue, but an issue when the user&#39;s test file (created on Mac) is opened and published on Windows. Since the Cloud servers are Windows-based, the issue is observed. So, the issue needs to be fixed in Vectorworks in order for the Cloud to produce the expected results.<br/>
The issues observed are:<br/>
Text scaling issue on AV0.1 <br/>
Worksheets scaling on AV1.5c, 1.6, AV1.8 AV4.7<br/>
<br/>
Please compare the attached screenshots form Mac and Win, and notice the difference. The scaling of the worksheets occurs after the worksheets are recalculated.<br/>
This is one example, where I annotated the differences. Similar differences are found on the rest of the sheets mentioned above.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if the same thing happened in VW 2021 since this particular beta alert didn&#39;t happen there. Other undo alerts (for example the one reported in VB-178386) will keep the alert on-screen until the user does another operation. Maybe the &quot;Geometry&quot; phase of the progress bar is causing the alert to disappear prematurely?

-Choose the Roof Style as shown and keep the other settings at default<br/>

In cell G311 I added a SUM function to give me a total length of all studs; the function fails. This is because many of the cells are text, not numbers, and cannot have arithmetical operations performed on them. In fact, there appears to be an invisible character in each that prevents their being easily reformatted as dimensions or numbers, as well as a string of spaces after the last digit. The spaces can be removed with Find/Replace. But copying the recalcitrant cells and pasting into a text editor, stripping out all formatting, then copying and pasting back does not fix the invisible character problem. The only solution I have found is to manually add a &quot;=&quot; at the beginning of each string of numbers, hit return, then go back and delete the &quot;=&quot;. Very tedious.

The enclosed huge file is from a user. If you export to MVR and use the first setting (everything) it will take some time because the file is so large but using Activity Monitor it uses about 110GB of memory. <br/>
<br/>
Once the export has finished after about 30 minutes it seems to retain the memory according to Activity Monitor and doesn&#39;t hand it back. So I have to quit to set it back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
I might well be making false assumptions but this is what it seems to me. I am prompted to do this VB due to the Forum post: <br/>

I have attached a video of the issue, it doesn&#39;t seem to matter whether the new section of truss is created by duplicating an existing section or by using the insert truss tool, the behavior is the same, the drop closes to the new section will move.<br/>
<br/>
The correct behavior is that the drop should only move if the user consciously decides to move it.<br/>
<br/>
To recreate<br/>
<br/>
draw 3 duplicate truss line directly under each other and connect them with the insert connection tool using the insert drop mode.<br/>

Users can easily miss that they are placing completely different though similar symbols during their drawing time than they had chosen.<br/>
<br/>
These are the steps taken and shown in the attached 03:30 minute video.<br/>
 # Start with a new blank document.<br/>
 # Using your resource manager, navigate to VW libraries, default, cable tools, and land on the +Distributors US+ file.<br/>
 ** I have also tested using other distributor folders.<br/>
 # Open the power distro folder and import the first six symbols.<br/>
 # Navigate back to our drawing and confirm that you now have those six distributor items.<br/>
 ** Please keep your resource manager open but do not select any of the symbols.<br/>
 # Open the distributor insertion tool.<br/>
 # Using the tool Resource Selector option, select the first Distributor.<br/>
 # Click on the automatic numbering preferences button<br/>
 # Add a checkmark in the use column.<br/>
 # Place a 1 in the start field. —STOP.—<br/>
 ** Notice the Resource Manager does not have any of the distributors highlighted.<br/>
 # Click OK. ---STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice that now the last symbol in the RM is highlighted.<br/>
 ** Notice this symbol is NOT the one we chose using the Resource Selector.<br/>
 ** The one we chose is still indicated in the Resource Selector field.<br/>
Continue.<br/>
 # Insert a distributor.<br/>
 ** You should now see an empty box. —STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice the Resource Selector still has our chosen Distributor.<br/>
 ** Notice in the RM that the Sixth (and last) distro symbol is now highlighted.<br/>
 # Click on the distributor symbol Resource Selector —STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice that even though the Resource Selector field still has the name of our first choice, the sixth distro is now highlighted. It now matches the RM.<br/>
 # Under the Resource Selector, choose the first distro again.<br/>
 # Place the distro.<br/>
 ** This should now work. —STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice the sixth distro is still highlighted in the RM.<br/>
 # Click to place another distro to confirm it is working.<br/>
 # Change the numbering to reset the number back to 1.<br/>
 # Place another distro.<br/>
 ** This should result in an empty box again.<br/>
 ** Notice in the RM that the last distro is still highlighted.<br/>
 # In the RM, double click on the third distro to highlight it.<br/>
 # Use the Distributor Symbol Resource Selector and activate the same third Distributor.<br/>
 ** Notice that now the same symbol is highlighted in both the RM and the Resource Selector.<br/>
 # Place two distributors. These should be correct.<br/>
 # Reset the numbering back to #1<br/>
 # Place another distro, and this should work again. —STOP—<br/>
 ** Take note that the two symbols are still matching in both the RM and the Resource Selector.<br/>
 # Using only the Resource Selector, change to the fifth distro. —STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice in the RM that the third distro is still highlighted.<br/>
 # Place the distro.<br/>
 ** It should have placed the chosen 5th distro.<br/>
 # Reset the numbering back to #1 via the number preferences button.<br/>
 # Click to place another distro. —STOP—<br/>
 ** Notice it has placed the distro currently highlighted in the RM and NOT the one chosen via the Resource Selector.<br/>
 ** Notice that the one chosen via the Resource Selector is still called for in the Resource Selector.<br/>
<br/>
This may be related to my prior VB-182089 <br/>
Telling of how the RM doesn’t trigger the Resource Selector properly. Perhaps the RM is being triggered by the renumber tool?<br/>
<br/>
I also tested this in Windows. The only difference seems to be that the symbols in the RM did NOT change their highlighted status indications.<br/>

In the enclosed file on the truss layer there are some Cosmic Global F44300 Straight 3m trusses.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Spotlight&gt;Rigging&gt; Replace Truss  / Replace Truss type the software crashes.<br/>
<br/>
If you select a stick and in the OIP click &#39;Select System Objects&#39; the program will vaporise.<br/>
<br/>
I have checked all the symbols in the F44300 file and in a blank file it seems ok when trying the above. <br/>
So this must be file related but somehow something has made it corrupt. I can redraw them in another file and copy and paste into this file and it seems to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter

In the properties the adapter uses the localised name of the cable connector for each side of the adapter, where as in the report it displays using the universal name of the connectors for each end.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
draw a cable object<br/>
<br/>
in the object properties give it a start or end adapter<br/>
<br/>
create a report using the cable object as the criteria and select the parameters cable run id, adapter start and adapter end.<br/>

The new report will display the adapters using the back-end universal name for the connector not the localised name like the object properties

                Spotlight edit cable part dialogue errors
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When using the Edit Cable Part dialogue, accessed from the Manage Cable Parts dialogue there are several errors<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The diameter and cross section area fields do not use consistent  (or correct) units<br/>
 * the diameter field doesn&#39;t display any units, should be mm<br/>
 * the cross section area field displays cm² it should be in mm² (normal international standard)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second is how the cable diameter is used to calculate the cross section area (and the same going in the other direction).<br/>
<br/>
The formula seems to use the same values no matter how many cores the cable has, which then means that for many cable types the cross section area is not correct<br/>
<br/>
for example a EU standard 2.5mm² socapex typically has an outer diameter of approx 17.8mm (varies a bit between manufacturers) the edit parts<br/>
<br/>
if 2.5 is entered into the cross section area field in the Edit Cable part dialogue you get 17.8 out which is what I would expect<br/>
<br/>
However if I want to update a 16a 3 phase CEE 2.5mm² cable which is a 5 wire cable I don&#39;t get the correct results<br/>
<br/>
from the Titanpower, a very popular UK cable supplier<br/>
<br/>
https://www.titanpower.co.uk/2-5mm-ho7-rubber-5-core-16a-3-phase-rubber-cable.html<br/>
<br/>
their standard 16a 3 phase cable has an out cable diameter of 11.8mm and each the wires should have a 2.5mm² cross section<br/>
<br/>
if I put 11.8 into the diameter field I will get a cross section value out of 1.09<br/>

<br/>
Hi Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
A Bug with the Multiview, when I want to use it with a floating view pane on my secondary screen. I recorded my screen to show my examines. I think it&#39;s a problem between the arrangement and the resolution from the two screens. It happens when the Macbook has the primary display. When I change the arrangement to the second display, that this is the primary, it&#39;s works.<br/>
 I have succeeded to reproduce the problem on another computer with a different second monitor.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022 I testet it with the build 606810.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Denis

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
Activate a TE15 Sheet layer<br/>
 Select the Viewport -26 which is in the lower left corner of the drawing area<br/>
 Edit the design layer of the viewport <br/>
 Edit the 3D components of the ‘L SECT SR’ 3D symbol<br/>
 Vectorworks crashes <br/>
 If Vectorworks doesn’t crash exit from the edit mode of the 3D components of the symbol and edit again<br/>
 I was able to reproduce on Mac M1, OS 11.2.3. I was unable to reproduce on Mac 10.14.6<br/>
 After Vectorworks crashes the opened file is saved with suffix v2015. ( Green Farms AS Imported_VB222413 v2015)

The file supplied in that bug (also attached here) is performing worse in 2022 than 2021 in regards to to zoom and switching view.  The file often hangs, I even had Vectorworks crash once on Windows.  Unfortunately I am not able to provide a dump file or steps to reproduce that crash.  This performance issue is on both MacOS and Windows.

On Windows, see CListBrowserEx::SetItemInteractionType. In some cases, ListBowserGridItem::make_item returns nullptr instead of a control.<br/>

There is currently a workaround for two of the above types for the criteria dialog in CListBrowserEx::SetItemInteractionType.<br/>

These two criteria dialog issues were fixed by use of a workaround, changelist 602198, implemented in criteria dialog code; VB-179868 and VB-179861.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The attached file includes a paint node on the drawing, and a script that creates a texture resource from the paint node.   Texture Test 4 is before the script is run.  Texture test 5 is after the script has been run to create the texture resource.  Texture Test 6 is with the texture applied to a sphere, it is working properly.  Debug list view shows everything fine, and the texture resource can be applied and renders on objects OK.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When this texture is imported into a blank document, the image def node seems to be moved to a child of the texture node, rather than a child of the texture bitmap node as it was before.  This breaks the texture so that it doesn&#39;t render with the image properly.  Renderings don&#39;t show the image and the Edit Texture dialog doesn&#39;t show the image, editing the image shader in the Edit Texture dialog shows a VW logo denoting the image is missing.<br/>

It seems that this bug happens during the resource import somewhere.<br/>

hPaint = vs.FActLayer()<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve encountered what seems to be a conditional bug for you. Concerning a Vectorworks 2020 file, with Section Viewports. When the file is opened in VW2021SP2 and the Section Viewports updated, objects from some (not all) Design Layers shift sideways. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to reproduce this using my own v2020 test file, but this behaviour does not occur in my file. <br/>
<br/>
The user has experienced a fair number and variety of issues over time and all reportedly occur in files derived from template files (seemingly) created in Vectorworks 2017. I&#39;ve asserted data corruption and that the templates should not be used going forward, but the user is stuck with this file as it is for a multi-year project, meaning starting from scratch is not an option. If this issue is particular to his file/s you may appreciate knowing I have made another submission with a file from him: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-177098. Perhaps it is purely a function of data corruption too. <br/>
<br/>
As per my screenshots, go to Sheet Layer A4.00 and update either Viewport. Most of the Design Layer content will shift sideways. This does not occur when opened in VW2020.

 --&gt; In Solibri and BIMcollab ZOOM you should see a tab called &quot;Material&quot; listing the material in each component - in the former there is no such tab, in the latter it&#39;s empty. You do, when doing the same with an IFC2x3 Vectorworks document.<br/>
 2b) set Export Options for Wall to only &quot;*ByComponents: True*&quot; (all others False)<br/>
 --&gt; In Solibri and BIMcollab ZOOM you should be able to select both the whole wall and pressing SHIFT also the components of the wall, but you cannot with the IFC4 file. You can, when doing the same with an IFC2x3 Vectorworks document.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the issue? What is the limiting factor here?

Place a Shape file on the desktop and import. It should be no problem.<br/>
Then place a shape file into a succession of folders so that it is 12 folder deep as per enclosed folder &quot;This will produce error&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This will create the error message &quot;&#39;An unknown error has occurred during this geographic operation&quot;. The Details log file is usually the file path.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that once Vectorworks creates this message no matter where the file is, even on the desktop Shape files are no longer able to be imported!<br/>
<br/>
We have:<br/>
Uninstalled and deleted the user folder and reinstalled.<br/>
Created a new user account with admin permissions<br/>
Rebooted in safe mode<br/>
<br/>
The user presented to us with this problem. He is on Big Sur and I on Catalina. I could not repeat the problem on our Big Sur machine or on my one.<br/>
<br/>
However once I got the error message by using the nested folders, I too am no longer able to import shape files even when after I renamed my user folder and the shape file is on my desktop, nor any shape file!<br/>
<br/>
I am now at the same point as the user. I haven&#39;t tried getting the error message on SP4 or v2022 because I am hoping you can replicate.<br/>
<br/>
We have lost the ability to import shape files!<br/>
<br/>
Files enclosed including his .spx, shape files zipped, error message, error log, installer log text.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

So, at the very least the error reported is incorrect or misleading, or, there is something going wrong in the calculation.

<br/>
For example, the attached MVR uses one of Vectorworks&#39; default textures, filename &quot;Siding Aluminum Double Dutch Lap Blue 5in &lt;Surf Hatch&gt; RT.png&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the 3DS files, the texture filename is given as &quot;Siding Aluminum Double Dutch Lap Blue 5in &lt;Surf Hatch&gt; RT.png&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the MVR itself, the texture is &quot;Siding Aluminum Double Dutch Lap Blue 5in %3CSurf Hatch%3E RT.png&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the angle brackets have been replaced by &quot;%3C&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that the texture filename has been URI-encoded when saving it, but this change to the filename was not propagated to the 3DS file(s) that reference it.<br/>
<br/>
This inconsistency means that no MVR loader is able to find the texture, and the cones are left untextured.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the 3DS format itself is generally considered to only support DOS 8.3 filenames, so not all 3DS loaders are capable of loading this file.<br/>
<br/>
 The same fault appears to occur in all Vectorworks 3D model exports that use separate texture and mesh files, such as 3DS, Collada, FBX (external textures) etc.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Collada and other formats have specific encoding rules for filenames (URIs).<br/>
It does appear that the filename is being URI-encoded for Collada, but the encoded version is being used to save instead of the original. This means Collada importers decode the URI and cannot find the texture!

For some reason a few objects within this Title Block Border go haywire when I edit multiple sheets using the Title Block Manager.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had similar distortion happen at random times in the past; previous occurrences weren&#39;t necessarily caused by the Title Block Manager, this is simply the first time I&#39;ve found reproducible steps.<br/>
<br/>
I have a suspicion that the geometry inside the Layout might somehow set to different planes? (which I don&#39;t even understand how or why that would be possible). I&#39;m not sure how to fix it outside of recreating the geometry. Really I want to understand the underlying cause so it can be avoided in the future.

Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
We have a file which we can not open on 2022 version of Vectorworks as it gets stuck on Updating walls. I have tried to open that file with the 2022 beta SP1 and it seems to crash Vectorworks straight away. Files seems to work fine on 2021 version.

Notice also that the image prop has disappeared from the 3D Graphics group.<br/>

Both the 2D and the 3D Graphics groups are incorrect.<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any workflow that could lead to this?<br/>

Also, the Spread of the &quot;Callicarpa bodinieri &#39;Profusion&#39;&quot; plant style reports 1500 mm while the actual spread of the geometry is about 500 mm.<br/>

I can&#39;t say how it came to this, whether it is a plant style from the default library or custom style created by the user.

                VW2021SP4 +Interiorcad F3.2 often slow and crashing a lot
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi team, <br/>
<br/>
We need your help with this one. We&#39;ve tried to apply the standard process of elimination, including a clean installation and User Folder, but the customer has been working with a contractor who is helping them build library files and doing their own troubleshooting throughout this process as well, which has made it impossible for us to definitively narrow down a cause. Because of how convoluted the process has got I&#39;ll just keep to the particulars: <br/>
 * On two different, but very high-spec Windows desktops, if a cabinet symbol (of the &#39;Cabinet 3D&#39; variety) is dragged from the Resource Manager into the drawing, Vectorworks crashes. (Using license: G0RFL6). <br/>
 * After installing their User Folder into my VW2021SP4 +Interiorcad F4 the same procedure did not produce a crash. Neither did a wide variety of typical actions or plug-in object edits nor high-demand processes. (Later also tried with Interiorcad F3.2 to match theirs, but still no crash). <br/>
 * One user (Carl) has used their .vwx files on his personal laptop at home with Vectorworks 2021 SP4 + Interiorcad F3.2 or F4 and cannot incur crashes via this sequence either. (Using license: G0RFL6). <br/>
 * The business owner (Brendon Munro) is also having lots of issues on his laptop (including crashing), but for various reasons I&#39;ve not yet conducted a methodical tech support process for him. Mostly because his small amount of RAM makes his computer an unreliable test vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
For both desktop PCs I&#39;ve attached:<br/>
 * Dxdiags. <br/>
 * Reliability History reports, featuring events that have accompanying crash logs. <br/>
 * DMP files / Crash logs. The most recent ones (2021-09-14) were induced by the above process. <br/>
<br/>
I note that the Reliability History cites various &#39;Fault Modules.&#39; I&#39;m aware that what Windows cites as a fault module is not necessarily the root cause, but it would be great if all possibilities could be considered as to what&#39;s causing these crashes. This customer has suffered many issues, some due to user error, some were environmental, some fleeting etc, yet they have expected us to fix all problems, even when/though most of them have been due to things outside our purview and despite that their files and customisations are based on bad practices concerning files and setup. <br/>
<br/>
So far, as part of this and prior issues, Carl&#39;s &#39;Design 3&#39; computer (DESKTOP-2A89HUE) has had:<br/>
 * A clean installation of Windows. (According to their IT provider, but I am not confident this was done properly). <br/>
 * (Therefore) the graphics card driver should be clean also. It is at least, very recent. <br/>
 * Then a clean installation of Vectorworks + Interiorcad (performed by me, following best-practices). <br/>
 * Since the above, after these recent issues arose/continued the Carl asserted the User Folder was at one time fully removed (by their contractor), but issues persisted with it removed. After they said this I deleted the usual Vectorworks registry files as prescribed by the Forum article on Resetting Vectorworks Preferences but no improvement. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to wonder if there is a hardware-specific bug at play. Hopefully you can answer this.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility would be defective hardware (memory or SSD perhaps) but proving this is well beyond our purview or my current skillset. <br/>
<br/>
We would be very grateful if you could review all the dmp files (for a broad view of issues and causes) but specifically advise about today&#39;s crash logs: What&#39;s the likely cause. <br/>
<br/>
In case you want to examine [you can download our copy of their User Folder here|https://www.dropbox.com/s/26fx6373bfw9g6e/Carl%2520Geel%2520-%25202021-09-09%252004.00.08%2520-%25202021.zip?dl=0] and I&#39;ve included screen recordings of Carl&#39;s &#39;Design 3&#39; (DESKTOP-2A89HUE) and his prior computer &#39;Design&#39; (DESKTOP-BJESUSO) crashing as described along with the file used at the time, DMP files, the Dxdiag files and Reliability History log of recent crashes. <br/>
<br/>
Please attribute your findings to the computer concerned because Carl&#39;s one (DESKTOP-2A89HUE) is a recent $12,000 acquisition bought specifically to handle Vectorworks + Interiorcad and complex geometry and the customer is naturally pretty frustrated with the number of issues they&#39;ve had despite their investment. <br/>
<br/>
Much thanks, <br/>
<br/>
Jeremy<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*EDIT:* Since submitting this:<br/>
 * The user Carl, has reported:<br/>
 ** An increase in the frequency of crashes.<br/>
 ** The number of things that trigger a crash has increased, including just switching from a Sheet Layer to a Design Layer. He said restarting his computer did not prevent these. <br/>
 ** Graphical anomalies (artefacts duplicating and/or lingering onscreen), similar to: <br/>
 * The boss submitted a screenshot of graphical anomalies he got on his laptop. (See uploaded image, &#39;Nonsensical graphical anomaly.jpg&#39;

Because there is an open input port on the node named &quot;&gt;&quot; (which would name the input port accordingly in the wrapped network), when this network is wrapped, an error is presented. Maybe we should prevent special characters in node names and require alphanumeric names?

In the last beta testers meeting Chuck Walthall noted that this is a regression compared to the Vectorscript implementation. And he&#39;s right. So I&#39;m filing this bug so we look at it again maybe we can have it all?

                IFC Landscape: The right workflow to model gutters in Vectorworks (for IFC exports)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      A big customer of ours is trying to model a gutter using the hardscape object, changing the IFC entity to IfcPipeSegmentType and setting the PredefinedType to GUTTER.<br/>
<br/>
They do that because modelling the hardscape is pretty easy using the modifiers that already exist in the German version. Only I&#39;m not really sure the hardscape object is the correct *way* to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Online resources about how to correctly model gutters far and few between. Also being an architect doesn&#39;t help in the matter of landscape planning.<br/>
<br/>
Appart from possible IFC specification issues, there are currently two issues with the IFC export of such a modified hardscape, for which I can report bugs if you like:<br/>
1) setting the export options to &quot;SeparateInstances: True&quot; works for the hardscape object as long as it stays IfcSlab. When changing the entity to IfcPipeSegmentType, a part of the object is not exported to IFC.<br/>
2) in contrast to walls, slabs and roofs, you *cannot use component* relevant information to *set conditions* for hardscape objects in the *data manager*. That makes it impossible to steer the export process for these objects.

                Solibri Direct Issues with Symbols

<br/>
1) It appears that symbols that were solid modeled are now transparent in Solibri.   For example, there are wall panels with and without windows.  They are both based upon the same wall panel symbol that was solid modeled.  A window was added to the area where a solid subtraction created an opening.  Those nested symbols have a Window that appears correctly (solid) yet the wall panel itself does not (transparent).<br/>
<br/>
2) There appear to be sync issues with nested symbols. The unnested symbols can be selected in one program and highlighted in the other.  This is not the case for the nested symbols.  <br/>
<br/>
3) There also appears to be an issue when moving symbols and them not always syncing correctly in Solibri. This was noticed first by moving a wall panel out of the building envelope.  Solibri reflected the move correctly.  The panel was then moved back into the building envelope but the move was not reflected in Solibri.  The videos attached are another version of this description<br/>
<br/>
These were not an issue in the previous version of Solibri.

At the Moment this is not possible. But I think we need a good Workflow or a solution. The Following I can imagine:<br/>
1. Exporting a Document and &quot;add&quot; ton an existing IFC File (maybe be complexe and errors are possible)<br/>
2. Or exporting the Target Document to IFC. The Export would look into Viewports and creates correct IFC Strucure for it.<br/>
The user can build this Structure in Vectorworks with refered viewports. Also those Viewports can be exported in IFC but the Data and the geometry (if components have different heights) are not exported correctly. This could be rated as ab Bug.<br/>

Also really this is also a burning BIM Worklfow-issue which arrives our consultants, trainers and supporters.<br/>

                IFC: Unexpected Data manager behavior (WAD or BUG ?)

This is why I tried to explain the problem in 4 different movies. I guess that all is related to one issue and therefore I did not log it as different bugs. We would appreciate if you can let us know if this is by design or bugs in data manager.<br/>

Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Watch the attached movie 01-04<br/>
 # We also attache some small Vectorworks files if you want to reproduce the steps on your side as well.

<br/>
I attached a client document with the problem, that exterior walls are not clipped to the roof in the IFC export. In VW the walls are clipped with the roof and generell the clipped walls looks OK.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for testing.<br/>

But it is interesting to see that the heights of the columns in the object info palette are not correct and IFC is exporting these values and column heights. In other words there is a difference between the hight information in object info palette and the visual hight in Vectorworks. Therefore we are not sure if it is a column issue or an IFC issue.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Watch the attache movie first<br/>
 # Open &quot;1902_P-0210_GR_Haus_A.vwx&quot; to reproduce the issue<br/>
<br/>
The exported IFC file is also part of the testifies if you want to open the IFC directly.

Archicad 22: 4 minutes<br/>

Import tests show that it&#39;s the IfcSlab and IfcWallStandardCase entities that cause the long processing in Vectorworks.<br/>

<br/>
Important Note: This comes from a Customer with 416 Licenses (KNAPP AG).<br/>
<br/>
The attached DWG Import.vwx was created by importing the attached .dwg file (meters were used).<br/>
<br/>
The attached Symbol.vwx was created by copying the Symbol named Fördertechnik 20061219 to a new empty document. The Symbol was &quot;too long&quot; and that was being caused by two Text objects which I removed to create a more &quot;neat&quot; Symbol.<br/>
<br/>
In the Symbol.vwx, use the command &quot;Scale Objects&quot; for the Symbol. For example X,Y,Z with 0,5.<br/>
<br/>
The Symbol instead of being scaled to half of its size, it will move place.

The left side vertical dimension is a custom dimension style made from the Arch standard dimension. The horizontal dimension closest to the rectangle is set to ASME Dual Stacked.

Go to File:Document Settings:Units and go to the Dimension pane.<br/>

Set the Fraction Display for Dimensions to the first mode and click the OK button. Note that all four dimensions show the fractional values properly.<br/>

Go back to Units and change to either the second or third mode of Fraction Display and click the OK button. Note that the Dual Stacked Dimensions, both the stock ASME and the custom one now show no fraction and appear as if they have been rounded down.<br/>

The fraction is just getting dropped. The rectangle has a vertical fraction of 0.2 inches and a vertical fraction of 0.7 inches. Both are dropped and not displayed. The dimension is not rounding to the nearest inch.<br/>

<br/>
The steps taken to experience this crash are not typical, but a crash they do cause on Mac and Windows<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 # Insert 1 or more Lighting Devices in a drawing<br/>
 # With devices selected or not selected (doesn&#39;t seem to matter), Go to Spotlight Numbering under Spotlight<br/>
 # Check 1 or more fields in the Field List (*keep Primary Direction set to Manual*)<br/>
 # Click OK<br/>
 # Do not click on any Lighting Device<br/>
 # Go back to Spotlight Number<br/>
 # Click Cancel in Spotlight Numbering window<br/>
 # It may take a few seconds, but Vectorworks will crash<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note: There were a few instances it took a minute or two before crashing, sometime trying to preform another action or click.  <br/>
<br/>
You will notice the curser still has the Spotlight Number Manual Reticle after canceling, but the red highlight that usually occurs when hovering over a Lighting Device with Manual Spotlight Number is not present.

<br/>
Using Design Layers to control what&#39;s visible does work however. <br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The user has since supplied additional data: <br/>
 * They&#39;ve tried reinstalling Nomad. No better. <br/>
 * They have a Samsung Galaxy A50, &quot;up to date running Android 11.&quot; <br/>
 * He has the additional symptoms of the screen/view going black and then after clicking the &#39;reset view&#39; button, the model becomes visible once again but is rotated 90º around the Y axis (I  think).

                Hidden Line viewport: stacking order of drawn geometry incorrect
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the attached file there are two main elements modeled: a 3D storefront (with thin grey pen) and some 3D scenery units in front of each pilaster (with thick black pen).<br/>
<br/>
When I create a Hidden Line viewport in Front orthographic view, the grey lines from the storefront are drawn with a 2D stacking order in front of the black lines of the scenery. I&#39;m not talking about the physical occlusion - that is drawn correctly, but rather when you look at the end points of the grey linework it is being drawn above the black linework. This is incorrect and looks terrible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not found a way to control this or solve the problem. The storefront is of course behind the scenery in 3D space. I&#39;ve also selected the 3D storefront and did &quot;Send to Back&quot; but that has no effect. I even tried created a separate Design Layer for the storefront stacked below the scenery, but even that had no effect.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, if I look at the same front view in the Design Layer it&#39;s drawn correctly. The issue seems to only be with the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
How can I solve this?

As the attached video demonstrates, an initial QS result has the valid command grayed. After I select the command from the menu (and cancel instead of execute it) and re-run the QS, the command is available.

The only solution is to fully uninstall/reinstall the Vectorworks Viewer.<br/>

Vectorworks Viewer 2022 also runs into this issue with the Attributes Palette; it&#39;s available when first launching the Viewer and you can even change attributes but once you close it, it&#39;s gone until you uninstall/reinstall.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unsure if this is by design or not, but the OIP is critical for reviewing contents in the file (without it, the Viewer lacks all the visible date/information) and it&#39;s also available at the start (and in previous versions of the Viewer).<br/>

    </p>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am working on a Working File in VW 2021 SP02 and as I was trying to change the Top Bound settings of a wall, I noticed that I no longer had any of the level types/storeys associated with the design layers (See Image 1 &amp; Image 2 for what it should look like). Note that the (after issue) VW file shows the layers associated with the storeys because I re-associated the storeys before saving the file. This changed the Z value of all the slabs and stairs to match L01, yet all the walls were where they were supposed to be. It also changed the default story elevation value of some but not all story levels to a negative number that made the level align with L01.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This happened two days ago. Today, the issue happened again but this time only the X-LEVEL layers were no longer associated to the storeys<br/>
<br/>
*He then wrote back with more info*<br/>
<br/>
I was able to recreate the issue.<br/>
<br/>
This happens when I use the “Align Layer Views” tool. I used it because lines from another layer were showing up on my 2D plan in what looks like the Top View Wireframe for the other layer (not Top/Plan). For which usually clicking on Unified View fixes it but, when it does not, I would click on Align Layer Views. This fixes the projection issue but removes the layer to story association.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is this the expected behaviour? I am under the impression that Align Layer Views should only affect the projection of 3D elements and not the layer settings (as per Image 4, [Align Layer Views|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2021/eng/index.htm#t=VW2021_Guide%2FViews%2FAligning_layer_views.htm%23CSH_45]). Please clarify.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I am unable to replicate the issue on my computer.  I am unsure I am repeating his steps the same way. But I don&#39;t think align layer views should remove story info?

My Working file increased in size from 300 MB to 850 MB after the alert. Prior to this, I was replacing railing symbols. Not certain what caused the WF to balloon in size.

In the enclosed file there is a cylindrical extrude although the shape doesn&#39;t matter. In the movie you will see:<br/>
<br/>
* There is an overall texture applied that is mapped by default with Surface UV, although when changed to cylindrical it didn&#39;t make any difference.<br/>
<br/>
* Added Decal to the texture 1m x 1m with rectangular mask.<br/>
<br/>
* Render in Fast Renderworks to see it.<br/>
<br/>
* Click the Attribute Mapping tool (AMT) and the Decal disappears. There&#39;s a message saying &#39;Stopping Render&#39; and in the render menu it shows Shaded.<br/>
<br/>
* Problem is that there is no Decal texture visible and no reshape box or reshape handles. Even when zoomed out in case it was miles away.<br/>
<br/>
* Clicking on a face to set the origin does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
* Sometimes clicking back on the selection tool will make the extrude lose it&#39;s original texture and is becomes grey. Yet the OIP says it is still applied.<br/>
<br/>
Using the new Texture tool one is also unable to use the AMT to set the origin of the Decal.<br/>

                Landmark: Editing Plant Styles when using multi views and one view in 3D, explodes the Plant tags

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
In the enclosed file you can see some plants in Top Plan and also in a 3D view as the file is using multi views. <br/>
<br/>
If a plant that exists on the page has it&#39;s style edited (all you need to do is open the Plant Style dialogue and close it) then the Plant Tags are exploded from the Plant object, individually turned into a group and placed on top of each other away from the Plant. The leader lines, and tick if used do the same. <br/>
<br/>
If the plants are regenerated the tags return correctly, leaving the exploded objects on the page. <br/>
<br/>
In the enclosed screenshot from the user you will see that the location of the exploded tags according to the OIP is far far away, yet the Tools&gt;Origin&gt;Centre drawing on Internal Origin does not report these numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I have enclosed a test file and a movie as well as the user&#39;s original file and some silent movies from him. It is hard to see what he is doing as he has two screens and there&#39;s no audio but I include all his stuff in a zipped file.<br/>
<br/>
I checked with Vectorworks, Inc. tech support and no one else is reporting this but we have taken some heat as we couldn&#39;t replicate until he discovered it was having a 3D view open in multi views that was the cause.<br/>
<br/>

                Import Layer Objects problem: Creates hundreds of &#39;NNA-&#39; classes among other things.

The enclosed &#39;0882SYD Ivanhoe Estate C2_SK_Basefile&#39; file has a problem with the active layer: L-Softscape - Park Level. On that layer there is a problem with the image fills not showing as they have very large numbers in the length fields if you click the little mapping button in the Attribute Palette.<br/>
We did discover a corrupt symbol which has been fixed and an errant hardscape many kilometres away that has been deleted.<br/>
When trying to copy the layers and objects into a new blank file we used the &#39;Create New layer&#39; &gt;Choose and navigated to the file. We selected all the layers in the list and clicked the button &#39;Import Layer Objects&#39;.<br/>
There were several warnings about being unable to import layer links (when can that be updated to DLVPs?!).<br/>
<br/>
Once the import had finished note the following:<br/>
1. Hundreds of classes prefixed with NNA.<br/>
2. Select what appears to be the drawing. Then Edit Invert Selection and note there are 7 viewports kilometres away. These are on design layers so how did they import? Delete them.<br/>
3. Go to s front view and do a Edit&gt;Select All. Note that there are objects 6000 kilometres up in the air. Some are viewports, groups and polys. This isn&#39;t the case in the original file.<br/>
<br/>
This report is about the layer import process scrambling the original file&#39;s objects.<br/>

In the enclosed file there are 3 sheets to be published to PDF. The resulting PDF is also enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
The PDF was unable to be printed at a professional print shop, and neither on a Canon on the macOS nor a Brother printer on Windows, nor another Brother here in the office on the macOS.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to print on an Epson on the MacOS at my home.<br/>
<br/>
If the user creates a PDF from the Print command on the macOS (save as PDF) then it will print. <br/>
<br/>
If the user copies and pastes the geometry into a new file and exports to PDF then it will print on his system.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

                The macOS:  v2020 &amp; v2021 continual problems - fixed with Settings folder being renamed.

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
I had a conversation with [~gmiller] about this hence this report. Everyday in Australia, I am getting macOS users to reset their user Settings folder in order for the program to function normally.<br/>
<br/>
This is independent of the actual macOS. I have users on 10.12+ to 10.15 and 11 with this same issue/fix. The problems can all be different from the program crashing, not launching, to palettes unable to be docked - all kinds of different issues. However renaming the Settings folder in their Vectorworks User folder nearly always fixes the problem. This is not an issue with Windows.<br/>
<br/>
This happens on a daily basis. Gunther suggested I get the user folder and in this report I have the Settings folder. When I swap it with mine and relaunch the program it appears to open but stalls. I have also included the user&#39;s crash report. I note she is on 10.15.7 and v2020 SP5 but once she renamed the Settings folder it launched fine.<br/>
<br/>
On the macOS there seems to be something &#39;flaky&#39;(technical term) about one or more of the files in the Settings folder.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

I haven&#39;t seen what the user did but I report this anyway. The user installed v2021 for the first time on their machine. They had an instance of v2020 on it as well. I do not know whether they migrated any settings.<br/>
<br/>
However after pasting in their 2021 serial number that we gave them, they successfully installed and started working. It was only after a while when they tried to save did they get the alert &#39;Unable to save or Print&#39; just like the old B series demos.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the splash screen it says [Evaluation Version] for the serial.<br/>
<br/>
Snapshots enclosed.<br/>

I am unable to attach the screen shots as each time it says there&#39;s a missing token, even if I screen shot the screenshots! I&#39;ll try once the report is up.<br/>

                Cloud Services Presentations - Link&#39;s Text to Display behaves oddly when trying to editing
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This issue is demonstrated with narration in the attached video.<br/>
<br/>
The issue is: When a link&#39;s &quot;Text to display has a typo and the user tries to edit the typo, either the entire line of &quot;Tech to display&quot; is deleted when trying to just remove one letter, or deleting one word of the line disables/remove the link behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Also, If the user selects entire link and clicks on the link icon in the formatting bar, the URL is editable but the Text to Display is not available to edit.<br/>
<br/>
The expected behaviour would be:<br/>
 * If the user selects the entire link on the board, then presses the link icon in the formatting bar, the Text to Display should be available to edit normally as text, and<br/>
 * If the user is working on the board and places their cursor after a letter that is part of some Text to Display, then presses the delete key, only the one character to the left of the cursor should be deleted (not the entire line of Text to Display), and<br/>
 * If the user is working on the board and selects some text that is within some existing Text to Display, they may retype that text without the entire line of Text to Display losing its URL and link functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Safari for Mac is being used in the attached video but the issue occurs in Chrome for Mac as well. (I am entering Vectorworks version info because JIRA requires it, but the Vectorworks version is not likely relevant for this issue.) <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for looking into this :)<br/>

Note that top edge now shows the splayed/rounded profile, even though the Wall Style still has it set to Straight.<br/>

I didn&#39;t see anything I the task doc about this being a known limitation, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a bug.<br/>

The bottom wrapping is missing in 3D so this issue effects 3D geometry as well.

<br/>
In Vectorworks 2021 everything is fine. After conversion - german or us version - you see a small separator wall in two windows.<br/>
<br/>
These windows consist of a german window and a hybrid symbol. After conversion there is a small separator wall between german window and hybrid symbol.<br/>
<br/>
Moving the symbol about 1 mm to the window would solve the problem. (That&#39;s fine as long as you do not dimensions the window).<br/>
<br/>
Guess it is a bug with wall opening in version 2022. Please have a look. And please keep in mind it is a bigger german customer.<br/>
<br/>
Testfile and video are attached.

We have had strange issues since a couple of days. <br/>
We have got customers that cannot start Vectorworks 2016 thru 2018 anymore with their dongle licence. This occurred suddenly without any other action than launching the app.<br/>
I suspect a bad redirection of the url asking for serial into the database server within these old installers. Also this happened only on FR version onwich the installer was provided by Cesyam.<br/>
This issue also happened on a E Serie converted from B Serie at first launch <br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand Order Center became Partner Services. I would like to know if something has changed causing ancient versions of Vectorworks freezing at launch

<br/>
Walls turn mesh looking with multiple lines which makes it hard to tell what is outside of wall, gypsum board, etc.  There are lines that go across the drawing.  When I look at the building in 3D and turn to OpenGL the model looks great but not usable in floor plan view. <br/>
<br/>
Tried inserting with two different settings under import views: 2D and 3D views and in 3D model view and both gave me mesh looking floor plan.<br/>
<br/>
Can you assist please.  I have included the revit file and one of my files after inserting along with some screen shots of my import options used.

<br/>
The customer renamed the &quot;ChromiumEF_dlls&quot; folder in C Drive&gt; Program Files&gt; VW2021 where the Fault Module is located, and it no longer crashes, and it seems to be working properly.<br/>
Customers in such situations have asked the following two questions.<br/>
1) What causes VW2021 to crash during Quit of VW2021 on the customer&#39;s PC?<br/>
2) What is the purpose of the files in this &quot;Chromium EF_dlls&quot; folder? And what kind of trouble does renaming the folder cause?*<br/>
*If this answer is related to confidential information, please let us know. We must not tell our customers anything related to confidential information. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, the customer&#39;s PC is a home built computer. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
**_R7. Hidden-Line renderings should look identical to VW 2021 when done updating, and have the same quality users have come to expect from them for display, printing, and exporting._<br/>

In the attached video I show a video in 2022 applying hatches to walls &amp; other geometry but not to aligned hardscapes. At the end of the video I show a similar file in 2021 with applied hidden line hatches to aligned hardscapes. <br/>

This is inconsistent behavior.<br/>

 # the solid white arcs over the GP that seem to be related to the seating but are not selectable and remain visible no matter what layers are turned on or off.<br/>
 # In the Section, you will see white squares behind the seats that behave similarly to the above.<br/>
 # There are box booms with a series of 3D lights on them. These are not lighting devices, just a plain 3D symbol. You&#39;ll see both the &quot;lights&quot; and the side arms are showing up just as 3D white rectangles.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This problem has presented itself multiple times. One time it happened after doing the following: <br/>
 # In the file turn off all layers but [3D] THEATRE. Note that everything appears just fine.<br/>
 # Draw a square. Everything still fine.<br/>
 # Extrude the square. Now all the white shapes have appeared<br/>
<br/>
But when I perform those steps again, it does not occur so I don&#39;t yet have a surefire way to force the problem.

When I open the file in Windows I receive this error message. (See Attached)<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a screen recording of the issue as well. <br/>
<br/>
What I am finding odd is I have two files that are essentially the same. The only difference is one has a few more resources in the resource manager than the other. One was made in August and one was made in September. (I have attached both)  The one made in August I have no problem opening in Windows VW 2022 but the one from September I get the error message. <br/>
<br/>
it doesn’t make sense that the file from August works but the updated one from September doesn’t. The only differences are a few resources added.<br/>
<br/>
I had someone with a Mac computer test this out using Parallels and they received the same error. However I had someone with a Windows computer try it out and they had no issues. So this makes me think it is something to do with Parallels.

To test, open the file and select the viewport, then go to Classes and just make any one of the Classes invisible. See the change in control point extents. Any change to Viewport will trigger this, like unchecking Display Planar Objects.<br/>
<br/>
Customer is on 2021 but I&#39;m seeing the same if I upgrade the file to 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Luka

On sheet A1.2 Section Locations Plan, take the blue end handle of a section line and move it to the side, crash.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t happen all the time.Sometimes it crashes, sometimes not.

<br/>
I have managed to narrow down the corruption to two layers (01-Ceiling and 01-Main) as these two layers cannot be imported into a new file, when Import layer objects is checked. In attempting this, Vw doesn&#39;t actually crash and neither does it crash on opening the file. Rather it freezes or on file open, freezes at stage 7 of the file open process.<br/>

Thanks.

Note that the cropped PDF file disappears from view when the image is zoomed in. With the attached file, and in my new 27&quot; iMac with 16GB VRAM, the image of the imported file disappears when the view is zoomed in to roughly 15%. This is a simple PDF without a lot of detail.

go to VW prefs and disable &quot;show with spacebar&quot; in Smart Options Display<br/>

The Document Preferences have &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; turned off. The viewport has it turned on under Advanced Properties. The text &quot;looks&quot; correct as I&#39;m working in Vectorworks, but when I export to PDF it ends up flipped.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I&#39;m not very confident in understanding how the viewport setting is supposed to interact with the document setting (does the viewport setting take precedence?), but at the very least, one would expect that whatever you see on screen is what would export to PDF.

                Loft surface cursor targeting behaviour
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      As seen in the attached narrated video and observed during a training session with a customer (so, replicated on their computer), the targeting behaviour of the loft surface tool is a bit unpredictable. This resulted in some frustration during the training session, though the trainee persevered.<br/>
<br/>
Basically...<br/>
 * When NURBS curves are coincident with the extrude they were extracted from, the cursor has difficulty targeting those NURBS curves.<br/>
 * If the extrude is moved away from the NURBS curves, loft surface cursor targeting works fine.<br/>
 * If the NURBS curves are selected prior to activating the loft surface tool, loft surface cursor targeting is also fine (but this is an odd workflow to suggest to a user.)<br/>
<br/>
This seems to occur in brand new files so I have not included a sample file.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to have this cursor behaviour reviewed and if possible corrected to make it more predictable.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

-Render the viewports, then quickly use the rectangle tool<br/>

Occasionally the hatch is visible when the view is still, I couldn&#39;t figure out when or how it resets to be OK. When it&#39;s not visible in still view it can be reset by going to Line Render Options, unchecking Display Surface Hatches, then going back in and checking it again - the hatch will show as expected in still view.

                Vision Crash on saving MVR as VSN

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      While working with the Vision Acceptance Test file, I experienced a number of Vision crashes while saving an MVR as a VSN file.  The crash did not happen every time or at the same point.  I even got a few VSN files out of the saving process before a crash or even without a crash at all.  Some times it required an action after saving to cause the crash. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even though there are not exact steps to reproduce the crash, I still felt it was worth passing the crash reports and information along.  This was occurring on BOTH Windows and Mac, though I am only able to provide Mac Crash Report.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I included a VSN that did get saved. It was a file that resulted a Vision crash, so that is probably the issue, but it behaves strangely.  Simply clicking on Lighting Fixtures in the Scene Graph cause the spinning beach ball or some times a Vision Crash.

<br/>
I feel like I have seen this before. Booting into safe mode clears the &quot;last known location&quot; and allows it to work for a bit. But, this issue in particular, appears to be not that the window is simply hidden behind another window. Rather, this seems like an issue where the last known location on screen ends up being &quot;off screen&quot; and it becomes impossible to work with the DMX Recorder as a result.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what is required to reproduce this. However, I have a feeling it may be tied to having HighDPI 4K displays. Due to Qt&#39;s handling of HighDPI, this issue may be specific to PC.

Answer Tech Support:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can see when I first open this file and update the viewport, the columns are visible. But all updates after that, the wall appears solid.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would recommend trying is navigating to a design layer with that section line cut, select it and nudge it using the nudge command (Shift and an arrow) this will also cause the vp to be required to update. In this case I did shift + left arrow to move it a couple millimeters to the left.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to submit this as a Jira.<br/>

                VS Concat() fails under very specific conditions
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This anomaly in the Concat() function was first noticed by Julian Carr.<br/>
<br/>
Through extensive testing it has been determined that the Concat() function can fail when the function is expected to return a text block of 1024 bytes in length. That&#39;s bytes, not characters.<br/>
<br/>
Since text now follows the UTF-8 convention, characters can have a length of 1 to 3 bytes. If the Concat() function builds a block of text that should return a block 1024 bytes in length through any combination of UTF-8 characters, there is a high probability it will fail. <br/>
<br/>
The attached VW 2021 file contains two scripts. One script creates the problem condition once and displays the resultant text block in an Alert Dialog with the Byte Length and the Expected Byte Length shown at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
The other script executes the problem condition 100,000 times and reports the number of times the function passed (showing 0 characters added), and the number times the function failed along with the number of characters that were added to the text block. The typical failure mode is for the Concat() function to add 1 extra character, but quite often it will add from 4 to hundreds of extra characters. I have included two screenshots showing different results.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to change the conditions of the programs, the number of loops to run, and the characters used to build the text blocks. To modify the scripts, follow the comments in the scripts.<br/>
<br/>
The only place I have seen this failure occur is when a text block should have 1024 characters in the return value of the Concat() function. It is possible for there to be other values of text block sizes that cause problems, but I have not found them.<br/>
<br/>
The problem does not affect VW 2018, but can be observed in VW 2019, VW 2020, and VW 2021. VW 2022 is not yet tested.<br/>
<br/>
Attached, one VW 2021 file containing scripts that demonstrate the problem.

See the attached movie, which references the attached fie. The Active Plane changes when in the Screen Plane Only mode. It can change to Symbol Definition ( a 3D mode in this 3D Symbol ) or to Screen Aligned.<br/>
<br/>
What is &#39;Screen Aligned&#39;? it is not explained in the Vectorworks Help. The Tape Measure Tool obviously does not measure the component of a distance aligned with the Screen Plane. This can be infuriatingly insidious when using the Move by Points Tool when objects can relocate to difficult to predict locations. They can be off the Screen and might not be immediately obvious when an Undo is convenient. They can then actually be time consuming to decipher and correct at some later point in time.<br/>

<br/>
Regarding VB-167358, the client program was modified in VW2021, but for customers who are using licenses that include VW2020 and below, this bug will occur every time the license is renewed.<br/>
The customer who reported this bug had been resolved with a modified license file, but the recent addition of the VW2021 license caused this bug again. <br/>
Therefore, in order to prevent similar troubles, it is necessary to fundamentally fix this bug so that it does not occur even if clients of VW2021 or higher and VW2020 or lower are used together. <br/>
<br/>
I have attached the customer license file, debuglog.txt, reportlog.txt, and license poor status image file. <br/>

                Automatic Plane + complex mesh somewhere in scene causes long hang

                                            <td class="description">      Working in 3D... If there happens to be a complex mesh somewhere on the screen (such as realistic 3D figure), and I try to use automatic plane to draw a 2D shape on a surface of some other object, Vectorworks frequently hangs for 5-20 minutes. Presumably it&#39;s &#39;seeing&#39; all the 3D polys of the mesh and trying to process each one individually as a potential automatic plane. Even if I consciously avoid the mesh the hang seems inevitable (either I accidentally moved the mouse across the object&#39;s bounding box, or Vectorworks is somehow seeing it anyways). I&#39;ve had this issue for years and it&#39;s a pain the butt. Sometimes it&#39;s a figure, or a couch, or a plant on the other side of the room.<br/>
<br/>
This also affects other things with interactive highlighting, such as the Extract and Shell tools.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached screen recording, at approx. 8 seconds in, the cursor turns into the spinning beach ball, though this doesn&#39;t show up in the recording. Also in this instance the hang clearly happens when I move the cursor within the bounding box of the mesh, though not directly over the mesh geometry.

Attempting asymmetric scale of PDF page fails, in that there is no response. If the PDF is cropped, the asymmetric scale applies only to the crop, not the PDF.<br/>

&quot;Scale Objects&quot; command works as expected using the &quot;measure &quot;option for any given length on the PDF. But asymmetric scale does not work.

The first bottom offset should stay intact unless the user specifically changes the settings. This is important to prevent mistakes in the BIM model.

Please resolve this condition. In the context of large scripts, such groups can end up being empty and it&#39;s not possible to check. This might be one of the most frequent causes of crashes in custom plug-ins.<br/>

<br/>
The user has provided a file in which hatches, when applied to polylines and rendered in Hidden Line, both:<br/>
 # &#39;bleed through&#39; its boundary, and <br/>
 # &#39;bleed through&#39; from one polyline behind, into a polyline in front. <br/>
<br/>
See the attached images. <br/>
<br/>
I also made a screen recording to demonstrate a condition that affects the &#39;boundary bleed through,&#39; but as I recorded it I encountered additional unexpected factors, so the second half is not very clear, succinct or conclusive. But I&#39;ve included it anyway because as I was undoing actions in my demo, Vectorworks crashed loosing my test file and I&#39;d rather not have to recreate it. <br/>
<br/>
Note: The boundary bleed through on the door occurs even if the polyline is brought forward away from the wall. <br/>
<br/>
*Can you please advise if this is a Vectorworks bug or corrupt objects in the file that can be removed to fix this problem. Thank you.*

*Behaviour experienced:* <br/>
Window types M2 and M3 are 1135 mm wide.<br/>
<br/>
*Behaviour expected:* <br/>
When updating the viewport they should have changed to 1022.5 mm because they&#39;ve been updated to this in the model file. But weirder still, if you check these resources (in _PST-B003-XX-XX-DR-A-Sheets.vwx_) in the in the RB (i.e. _A-Ss_25_30-M_Type_M2_ and A-_Ss_25_30-M_Type_M3_) you will see that they have actually been updated to the new size: 1022.5. It&#39;s just the version of them on design layer &quot;Window Schedule 500&quot; that hasn&#39;t updated.<br/>
<br/>
Note that these files were Project Sharing files to begin with. I changed them to standard files to see if that would flush out the problem but it didn&#39;t work.<br/>

Steps:<br/>
 # Open the Vision acceptance test file<br/>
 # Open the acceptance test VLC+ file<br/>
 # Once all connections are made and the DMX is active, activate any virtual panel control<br/>

_Notice that all the lights show up as a deep red._<br/>

When testing DMX using QLC+ about 90% of lights and parts of lights show as a deep red.

<br/>
When Exporting to DWG a 3D Symbol, the triangulation lines to preserve fills are displayed with Shaded and with Hidden Line the round shape is lost.<br/>
<br/>
We can see this when importing back to Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Should exist a solution to keep the smooth circular shapes of the objects after the export to dwg is done and the lines of the triangulation should not be displayed with Shaded, plus the face of the objects is shown distorted / ragged.<br/>

Solution? Workaround for the Customer, please? Thank you.

                Text styling: VW has no option for &quot;shadow&quot; and &quot;outline&quot; (only Windows)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Just yesterday I had a customer on the line that was complaining about measurement text showing up as styled with outline on the PDF, when the text looks fine in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to resolve the issue by manually setting a default text style to the text in question, but it was necessary for me to get their Vectorworks file to figure out the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently there are text styling options that are only available on MacOS:<br/>
* outline<br/>
* shadow<br/>
<br/>
That on its own is not the issue. The problem arises, when a Vectorworks user that works on Windows receives a file from a MacOS user. If a text comes with *outline* styling, it will *show up as* *outline* styling for the Windows user with no way to turn off the style other than to override it with a text style. *Shadow* on the other hand doesn&#39;t show up as any special style on Windows, but when printed it *shows up as* *outline*.<br/>
<br/>
There are two issues here:<br/>
* the missing style options on Windows (outline at least shows up, why not display the option?)<br/>
* the shadow style producing an outline text on Windows (when printed)<br/>
<br/>
_The latter point is especially frustrating for_ _the customer__, because they have to start comparing your PDFs with your viewports to find the faulty text objects._<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce: (see also screenshots)<br/>
1) open the attached vwx file on MacOS<br/>
2) see how the text really looks like<br/>
3) print to see that everything looks right (well, the shadow doesn&#39;t look exactly the same)<br/>
4) open the file on Windows<br/>
5) see that the text does not look loke on MacOS<br/>
6) print as PDF to see the issue with the shadow styled text<br/>

 # Update PIO on Document 2<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On both Documents the Script places a Symbol into the drawing. I think related to Marionette or to the script engine, the Symbol in Document 2 prompted to be replace. Maybe this is related to another feature, that is able to import symbol, which is used on a marionette, when script is executed. <br/>
I think the Feature is designed, to import symbol if a symbol is used in a script and this Script is in a red PIO which was inserted via Resource Manager. It is good it workes like this. But it sould be improved, by not importing/replacing a symbol, when the PIO copy/paste or inserted from the resource Manager not by jus swithing two different documents

A:<br/>
1) open file Scaff-only.vwx<br/>
2) insert the red symbol to check if the Marionette object works as it should<br/>
3) open new blank document<br/>
4) import the red symbol into the new document<br/>
5) insert the red symbol into the design layer (scale 1:50)<br/>
6) check if the Marionette object works as it should<br/>
<br/>
B:<br/>
repeate A 1-3<br/>
4) import the resource folder from the first document into the new one<br/>
5) import the red symbol into the new document<br/>
6) insert the red symbol into the design layer (scale 1:50)<br/>
--&gt; OIP shows 1 (Marionette) object, but no object is visible on the design layer<br/>
<br/>
7) open new document<br/>
8) import red symbol from 2nd to 3rd document<br/>
9) insert red symbol<br/>
--&gt; same as in the 2nd document<br/>
<br/>
So, it seems that importing the Marionette Object in a red symbol after importing the content breaks the Marionette Object (red symbol).<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look at this.

Open a new blank Vectorworks file.<br/>
With the resource browser pointed to HS Library.vwx Place three hardscape objects in the new blank file by dragging the hardscape style objects from the HS Library (in the resource browser) into the drawing window of the new blank file.<br/>
<br/>
Note that each of the hardscapes placed in the new file have different names.  These are the names of the hardscape when the style was created.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that each of the hardscape styles are found in a folder of the same name as in the library file.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Select the second hardscape and using the object info pallet style pull down replace the style with Dark Grey Granite Mulch by clicking in the Choose a style box and selecting the first style offered (in this case it was &#39;Sod&#39;).  and then pressing &#39;ok&#39; .  Note that the Hardscape style &#39;Sod&#39; has now been moved to a newly created subfolder named &quot;Hardscape Styles&quot;.  This is unexpected and will cause confusion in the users who will now not find the style definition where they expect it,.<br/>
<br/>
If you do the same thing with the third hardscape but this time choose a hardscape definition other than the one first offered, we still have the same issue with the name and colour and the hardscape definition moving. <br/>
<br/>
When I was reporting Bug VB-184321 I noted that the behaviour was different when I choose the first definition offered (the hardscape didn&#39;t move). But I have been unable to reproduce that here with the hardscape definition moving regardless of the style shown.  Not sure what the trigger is but I am sure that it shouldn&#39;t create a new folder and move the style.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate it always moves when I chose a style other than the first one I am offered and sometimes moves when I take the first one offered.  I think that once placed, it should never move unless I move it.<br/>

<br/>
*Note:* to replicate the bug, it&#39;s necessary to follow the above steps in both the English and the Spanish versions of VW 2021 and compare the Exit Profile/Salir Perfil label.<br/>
<br/>
Several strings containing *Exit* exists without being concatenated: Exit symbol, Exit group, Exit viewport, Exit light, etc. A new string, *Exit profile*, needs to be created to substitute these concatenated strings, Exit + Profile, as this impacts adversely the localized version in Spanish (see screenshot for details).

<br/>
The changes from an edited worksheet are not transferred correctly after commit / refresh. Generell it needs an extra recalculate for the worksheet, to see the changes in the other work files.<br/>
I&#39;ve made a movie to show what happens after refreshing in an other work file. Sometimes it works without the recalculate and partially the worksheet is empty and need the recalculate. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>

<br/>
This is especially visible on longer entries. Wrap text with Autofit Row Height, appears to fill the entire cell when in editing view, but after exiting back to the Sheet view, there appears to be an extra line of space.<br/>
<br/>
The workaround tends to be to select the cell, set the manual row height minus 11 points to have the entry have the same appearance as other cells without the extra space.<br/>
<br/>
The problem happens if someone edits an entry assuming the wrap will accommodate the changes. Text can be lost if the manual height doesn&#39;t get modified properly.<br/>
<br/>
While different fonts cause different amounts of difference, all the common ones seem to exhibit more or less the same thing. I gave you two examples and included the uncommon font for your testing. <br/>

<br/>
It is important when working on a lighting plot for events, theatre, television etc.. that the order of the lighting instruments is preserved when making large updates to align fixtures to a position or distribute them evenly. At no point should the order of the fixtures be changed.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the Distribute tool will change the order of the lighting devices, but only when used in a specific way. I&#39;ve attached a video detailing this. Note when the tool is used to distribute the devices from LEFT to RIGHT the order of the fixtures is the same. However when the tool is used to distribute from RIGHT to LEFT the order is flipped, and flipped and flipped again. <br/>
<br/>
This holds true when using the tool from TOP to BOTTOM.<br/>

<br/>
Scenario number one. Placing separate single lengths of truss to be combined into one hanging position.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with a new blank document.<br/>
<br/>
Failed:<br/>
 # Place a single length of truss.<br/>
 # Move away from the first length of truss and place a second length of truss.<br/>
 # Select both pieces of truss.<br/>
 ** In the OIP, notice that you have two truss objects selected.<br/>
 # In the OIP, click on the Convert to Hanging Position button at the bottom.<br/>
 # Follow the steps to create the hanging position.<br/>
 ## Notice that only the most recently drawn length of truss has been converted into a hanging position.<br/>
<br/>
Successful:<br/>
 Repeat these steps and use the Convert to Hanging Position menu option located under Spotlight/Convert Objects.<br/>
 Your results should show all items have been converted and included in our desired hanging position.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: The main process step that is missing between these two sets of steps is the window asking me whether I want to create a hanging position for each selected object, or to create a single hanging position from all selected objects. Therefore, the convert tool is only seeing the last drawn truss when used from the OIP. Even though the OIP says it has more than one object selected.<br/>
<br/>
You can repeat the above steps with as many individual pieces of truss and the OIP version will still only convert the last truss symbol drawn.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Scenario number two. Placing connected lengths of truss into one hanging position.<br/>
<br/>
Successful:<br/>
 # Select the Truss tool.<br/>
 # Select a stick of truss.<br/>
 # Choose the Single Insertion option and insert three connected truss to form one run of truss.<br/>
 # Select all three truss.<br/>
 # Convert to Hanging Position via the OIP<br/>
 # Create a single hanging position from all selected objects.<br/>
 # Use Geometry.<br/>
 ** This works.<br/>
<br/>
Failed:<br/>
 # Select the truss tool<br/>
 # choose the distributed insertion option<br/>
 # insert two lengths of truss<br/>
 # insert two more lines of truss.<br/>
 ** This presents us with an alignment issue that I have already submitted a bug for.<br/>
 Select all these four lengths of truss.<br/>
 ** We have four truss objects selected in the OIP.<br/>
 # Click on the convert to hanging position button in the OIP.<br/>
 # Create a single hanging position from all selected objects.<br/>
 # Click OK.<br/>
 # Give it a name and OK<br/>
 # Choose Use geometry.<br/>
 ** Notice only these last drawn lengths of truss were converted into a hanging position.<br/>
 ** As before, the OIP version of the tool is seeing only the last placed item it thinks is an object. Even though it showed multiple objects selected.<br/>
<br/>
Successful:<br/>
 Repeat the above-failed steps and this time use the spotlight object conversion menu option.<br/>
 This one works<br/>
<br/>
What the user should expect is if the OIP shows a number of objects are selected, all those objects should be included in the resulting hanging position.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      In the attached file it is not easily possible to correctly create Schematic views for any of the hanging positions that are created from truss objects that have already been given a roll or hanging angle before being converted to a hanging position.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to create to the correct schematic object is to break the hanging positions (by ungrouping twice), set the truss lines hanging angle to 0 (much harder than it sounds without breaking the truss line and/or disconnecting the attached lights), then running the create schematic views command and lastly having to correctly recreate the original hanging position (with the correct hanging angle and rotation)<br/>
<br/>
This is a huge problem for schematic views, as it is a very common workflow to convert trusses into hanging positions after they are correctly orientated in 3D (given a hanging angle and roll), due to how difficult this is to do after they have been converted into a hanging position (unless great care is taken when creating them they become hybrid object and can&#39;t be easily rotated in 3D).<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the most basic workflow scenarios that the schematic view should be capable of supporting.<br/>
<br/>
to test in the attached file<br/>
<br/>
select any of the hanging positions based on trusses that have hanging angles<br/>
<br/>
run the create schematic view command from the spotlightmenu<br/>
<br/>
the Schematic object created from the hanging position will be drawn without compensating for the trusses hanging angle inside the position, ie it will be the exact same geometry as the hanging position already displays not the desired top/plan view of the hanging position&#39;s trusses lying flat on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The test file is a large production with lots of angled hanging positions that are in theory exactly what schematic views are meant to help document. As it stands currently the user (not the designer) is going to loose a significant amount of pre-production hours reworking the file to be able to use schematic views. The amount of time required makes it very unlikely they will bother use schematic view and will just revert to the older rotated design layer view port option that schematic views was mean to replace!<br/>
<br/>
I have tried testing this in both 2021 sp4 and 2022 beta 5, with the same results in both

In the enclosed file there are some symbols of the Mac Aura XB which happen to be lighting devices.<br/>
When exported to PDF or printed, they do not show.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where they originated. When substituted for the same type of instrument from the shipping Vectorworks libraries they print as expected.<br/>

&quot;Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
Please submit this as a bug. I see that if I edit the modifiers of the slab and delete all the what appears to be cut outs for wall outlines? and return to the slab object, I can now cut holes all the way through. But as soon as I add those wall shapes back and only cut out the top component the issue returns.<br/>

&quot;Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely an odd one. I have not been able to determine exactly what is causing this. My guess is that it has something to do with the Materials. If I delete all but just one component in the style, I still have the issue. However, if I change that component to not use a Material and just have a Solid fill, I no longer experience the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please submit this as a bug on JIRA and send me the JIRA number so I can follow?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 * When [Navigation Graphics] of [Vectorworks Preferences] is [Good Performance and Compatibility] / [Best Compatibility]<br/>
 Depending on the [magnification ratio] on the screen, it may be displayed in the order of Solid Line-Solid Line-Dashed Line-Solid Line.<br/>

The edges between two objects are visible addicted to the used 3D-Object. Please watch the movie to get more informations about the used objects. The regression to 2021 is visible for a wall inside of a symbol, but from my point of view we should use the same rules for all the objects in the testfile.<br/>

I found this situation, that the gradient is changing after I connect all drains with each other. The basic shape is a rectangle with a drain in each corner. Are they not connected the drain slope is 2%. When I connect the drains with each other, the slope drain is switching from 2% to 5%. So I think the 2% are should consisting, when the default and minimum drain slope is on 2% in the settings<br/>
<br/>
I attached my Testfile.<br/>

<br/>
This appears to be a regression that happened sometime after VW24.0.6(522773) and before VW25.0.0(505414).<br/>
<br/>
I also still see the problem in VW27.0.0d(595669) although it seems to be less prevalent.

<br/>
The most recent Vectorworks version with which I encountered the issue is 2021. I don&#39;t know whether the issue is still present in version 2022.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen this issue on Mac. I think I remember seeing this issue on Windows, but i&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never reproduced the issue, since it is not possible for us to reproduce G-series issues at the office. So the assumption about origin of the issue is based on what several users told me.

The issue at hand is, that users are allowed to insert values into a field that make the roof geometry invalid and thus the roof disappears into thin air.<br/>
<br/>
It should be relatively easy to prevent that from happening in the first place and if it was allowed, it would be relatively easy to inform the user of an invalid value before desintegrating the roof by confirming invalid values.

&quot;if ((ST=roof) &amp; (pitch = different); roof face; roof)&quot; :D<br/>

The field &quot;Net Area&quot; is empty after select more than one space object. It would be great if Vectorworks could show the total Area of all selected space objects. After a few tests I finded out:<br/>
If you first select a rectangle, then the OIP shows the total area.<br/>
If you first select a space object and then a rectangle the OIP doesn&#39;t show the total are<br/>
Because of this inconsistency I&#39;ve created a bug report and not a wish.<br/>
Best regards, Marc

 # Bearing Height and Inset:  The roof geometry is not located to the correct position.<br/>
*Note 1:*  I believe this issues discussed while making Roof improvements for Vectorworks 2018.  However, I believe the main thing we did was to prevent the geometry from shifting after changing to different Eave Cut options of a Roof object.<br/>
*Note 2:* We have to be careful because we don&#39;t want to fix the problem and have Roof objects shifting unexpectedly in existing user files.  We would probably need to forward translate files to adjust the Bearing Height so that they remain in place.<br/>
 # Creating a Roof using a Roof Style results in an odd Inset value and a Bearing Height value different than what was specified in the dialog on insertion.<br/>
 # There are cases where the Soffit and Fascia seem to be in the wrong location.<br/>
*Note:*  The soffit case may be working as designed but needs investigation (and maybe a VE to improve it).  The fascia case does seem to be incorrect.

The PIO defines by two loci where the wall should end. When the wall feature is deleted, this works fine (image &quot;without wall feature.png&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
But the wall feature causes the wall to ignore the loci so the wall fails to draw the area next to the loci. (see &quot;wall feature.png&quot;).

I have been having various differences of behavior in this file. I copied the 3D model out of the file and pasted it into a new file and have attached a video of my experience with it.<br/>
<br/>
If I pasted the objects in the center of the new document the bucket works. If I paste further away from the origin, then the bucket no longer works.<br/>

I would submit this file as a bug.<br/>

The roof should just trim the interior walls, not stop its components on this interior walls.<br/>
In version 2020 it works correctly, so this is a regression.

You&#39;ll see the difference immediately when you open it. I exported this file back to Vectorworks 2021 and the condition persisted. I then created a completely new test file and objects in 2021 and got the same result, so perhaps this is a bug that&#39;s already been submitted.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When some top light symbols are inserted into the roof or roof face, the openings can be misaligned.  <br/>
<br/>
When the following symbols are inserted into the roof or roof surface as a top light, the opening can be placed in an incorrect position. <br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks Libraries&gt;Object Architecture&gt;Skylight the Rooflight Company Conservation Range.vwx&gt;Skylight Conservation Rooflight-CR-9<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
When I checked the symbols in the “Skylight the Rooflight Company Conservation Range.vwx” file, only &quot;Skylight Conservation Rooflight-CR-9&quot; was invalid, but there may be other files that are in the same state.<br/>
This can be avoided by changing the insertion point of the symbol to be the center of the shape. But I think it needs to be fixed. <br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample12543.vwx”. <br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Steps:<br/>
<br/>
Use the sample file.<br/>
[File name] 0726sample.vwx<br/>
* Sample files are created with v2020.<br/>
<br/>
1) Open the sample file in v2020 and check that the component named &quot;aa&quot; on the Roof Face is offset by &quot;200&quot; from the roof edge.<br/>
(200 values more than the other components)<br/>
<br/>
2) Open the sample file with v2021, select the Roof Face, select &quot;Dissociate All Walls&quot; from &quot;Wall Clipping&quot; of the Object Info Palette, and disconnect the Roof Face and the Walls.<br/>
<br/>
3) In the Object Info Palette, select &quot;Pick Walls to Associate ...&quot; from &quot;Wall Clipping&quot; again.<br/>
Click the four walls on the drawing and click the checkmarks on the toolbar to connect the Roof Face and the Walls. <br/>
 <br/>
4) Make sure that the value of &quot;Bound Offset&quot; set in the Component of the Roof Face is not reflected except for the part under the water (lowest side) of the Roof Face.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;0726sample.vwx&quot;,&quot;v2020_OK.mov&quot;,&quot;v2022_NG.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*Since the same phenomenon occurs in 2019, there is a possibility that the problem that was once improved in v2020 has recurred in v2021.<br/>
<br/>
*At the moment, there is no workaround, and it is possible that the phenomenon occurred during throwback, so we believe that this is a phenomenon that needs to be corrected.<br/>

                Splitting and Re-Composing NURBS Curves Results in Overlapping Vertices, Causes Editing Operations to Fail

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the Fillet tool and try to fillet the corners of the curve<br/>
<br/>
Note that it works fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now activate the Split tool in Point Split Mode<br/>
-Split the object at each corner<br/>
-Select the resulting curves and Compose them<br/>
-Now try to Fillet again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it fails.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this is happening because the split-then-compose process causes overlapping vertices to get created. If you delete those vertices the fillet then works fine.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions. This also happens in 2022.

                SBE: VWPolygonOperation::ClipToPoly(p_ret,p_test,p_clip) returns garbage
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In one of my plug-ins, I needed to clip the blue polygon (please see attached screenshot) at the left side at a certain x-value.<br/>
<br/>
So I created a clip rectangle (VWPolygon2D) with the requested X coordinate as left edge and set all the other corners of the clip polygon very far away to make sure that the clip polygon does not intersect the blue polygon.<br/>
<br/>
This clip polygon is green on the screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the polygon returned by VWPolygonOperation::ClipToPoly(p_ret,p_test,p_clip) contained just one vertex <br/>
which is obviously wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached code fragment to reproduce this bug.<br/>
<br/>
It is even weirder: if I reduce the coordinates of the clip polygon from 1e10 to 1e7 or 1e8 (const k_very_large in code fragment), the correct result is returned.<br/>
<br/>
This is very scary. <br/>
<br/>
As VW is supposed to support mauch larger coordinates<br/>
<br/>
(const extern WorldCoord kMaxLegalWorldCoord =  1.0E100;)<br/>
<br/>
it must not happen that even comparably very small numbers produce garbage. It looks as if VW still uses integers...<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if similar bugs exist for other geometry functions in the SDK... This does not motivate programmers to use them.<br/>

<br/>
A bug in a client document with the wall openings from windows. The wall openings don&#39;t source to all wall components and it look like the windows are just placed to the half in the wall. I found a connection to the level type &quot;OK-Rohboden [-11]&quot; from the Story &quot;OG 2&quot;, if I reset the level type to a manuell value, it works for a complete wall opening. I&#39;m not sure if the organization from the level types/ stories is the reason, that the wall opening isn&#39;t complete. I think it&#39;s more a works around fro the problem himself.<br/>
<br/>
In the attachment the document.<br/>

Thank you for testing.<br/>

This was brought up by user Ian Phillips (ianphillips@sbcglobal.net) in case we need to get back in touch with him.<br/>
<br/>
We can easily fix this by removing the User Origin (making it coincide with the Internal Origin) or by working around it, but it can be annoying.<br/>

Please let me know if there&#39;s anything we can do to be of further assistance, and have an awesome day!  :)

Their original file is &quot;VGB Res Model_ BPA_2020.12.29.vwx&quot;, and The document &quot;Window Rotation Test.vwx&quot; is a trimmed down version of the file with the issue more visible.<br/>

Is there any way to have this display correctly, or is this a potential issue with window schedules and ID tags?<br/>

<br/>
Objects came from a file where I for some reason had the Window-Main with no fill. (I don&#39;t recall exactly while)<br/>
<br/>
I inserted some windows &#39;Triple Slider&#39; from the library with Standard Naming on<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that they were not filled, so assumed the class Attribute setting needed to be refreshed, so selected the &#39;All Attributes by Class&#39; from the attributes palette<br/>
<br/>
I then edited the Class, noticed I had it set to no fill, so corrected that and accepted the changes. I then noticed that only the jamb and one of the three sashes filled.<br/>
<br/>
If I toggled an option for the window in the Info Palette (say &quot;create Niche...&#39;) to force a reset caused the rest of the sashes to fill in.<br/>
<br/>
In another file, I created an unsettled window from this style, added Lintel, Transom, Muntins, Trim, &amp; Sill. The jamb and the sash filled(including its munitions) along with the sill. The other two sashes (including their units), transom, trim, &amp; lintel did not fill until a forced reset.<br/>
<br/>
The same fill objects respond in reverse if you set the class fill to none

<br/>
We have a user reporting this issue and we can also replicate this in 2020 and 2021. We aren&#39;t sure this is meant to be working this way? <br/>
<br/>
When you add in a Bar width in the door settings anything thats a larger number you get this unusual border around the entire door. I believe this is the edge around the glass, however should this be controlled by the Bar width? <br/>
<br/>
Please find a test file and little video attached. <br/>

Best Wishes <br/>

In fact, it disappears because it is considered as a &quot;Planar object&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think, it should be considered as a 3D object because the purpose of this mark is to be present in section viewports.

<br/>
If you open the file I&#39;m attaching SectViewP_v2021.vwx in Vectorworks 2021 and look at the dialog box Advanced Section PropertiesI&#39;m attaching too, you can see that the simple Section Viewport is well represented. I mean, Vw 2021 has created different groups of structural and non-structural elements and uses Fill Attributes of two different Classes (Section Style anche Non struct Class) to distinguish the two groups in that Viewport; so the section of the open Door appears in red color.<br/>
Now open the attached file SectViewP_v2022.vwx in Vectorworks 2022; control that the Section Viewport is set the same way but look at the section of the Door: Vectorworks 2022 is wrong when has to distinguish the group of structural and non structural elements in a Section Viewport.<br/>
<br/>
Please could you have a look?<br/>

When a plug-in is reset, if any of the red reference object appears, something has changed with the original object/plug-in.<br/>

-Open test file in Vectorworks 2021<br/>
-Go to Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Reset All Plug-Ins and answer, &quot;Yes&quot;<br/>
-You&#39;ll notice the Windows remain unchanged from the red reference object in the background<br/>
-Open test file in Vectorworks 2022<br/>
-Even before the Windows are reset, you can see red lines appearing where the geometry has changed from Vectorworks 2021 for some reason<br/>

See attached image and movie<br/>

These Window objects go back many versions.  This is a smaller subset of the original test file where all other Window examples passed.

But the 2D representation is bad : <br/>
<br/>
instead of using the same system of 2D representation as hybrid object which is :<br/>
 * Above the cut plane : the +part+ of the structural member above the cut plane attributes<br/>
 * at the cut plane : the +part+ of the structural member at the cut plane attributes<br/>
 * below the cut plane : the +part+ of the structural member below the cut plane attributes<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks uses those attributes +to the whole object+ if it is above/at/below which is wrong.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the SM objects and move them to the &quot;Test&quot; class<br/>
-Now set the SM&#39;s pen color to &quot;Color by Class&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that all three SMs take on the right color, but the pen color of the SM with Material attributes doesn&#39;t actually get set to by-class. So if you now change the pen color of the &quot;Test&quot; class, the SM with Material attributes won&#39;t update correctly.

                Walls Within PIO Behave Differently in Vw 2022 Depending on Position of SetWallCornerHeights() : JBC
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Attached is a Vw 2021 file displaying some WinDoor objects in a wall. WinDoor has the ability to indicate when new windows or doors are added to existing walls or when existing openings are removed. It does this by adding zero height walls within the object (patches), that appear on either side of the opening or instead of the opening. In the WinDoor Settings dialogue &gt; Wall Existing tab, you can nominate the length of these patches and also which wall style should be used. <br/>
<br/>
To ensure that the nominated wall style for the patches has zero height, I use SetWallCornerHeights() to set the nominated wall style height to zero. Here is a typical code snippet:<br/>
<br/>
    MoveTo(x2, 0); MoveTo(x2, 0);<br/>
    WallTo(x2 + p__NewOpenRightPatch, 0);<br/>
    Flag := SetWallCaps(LNewObj, True, False, False);<br/>
    Flag := SetWallStyle(LNewObj, p__NewOpeningWS, 0, 0);<br/>
    Flag := *SetWallCornerHeights*(LNewObj, 0, 0, 0, 0);<br/>
<br/>
When you open the file in Vw 2022 and compare it to how it looks in Vw 2021, you will see that not only are the walls not zero height, but the wall style nomination is ignored and the document default wall settings are used - but only on one side of the window. The other side is correct. If I alter the order of the code slightly as follows, then it all works correctly: <br/>
<br/>
    MoveTo(x2, 0); MoveTo(x2, 0);<br/>
    WallTo(x2 + p__NewOpenRightPatch, 0);<br/>
    Flag := *SetWallCornerHeights*(LNewObj, 0, 0, 0, 0);<br/>
    Flag := SetWallCaps(LNewObj, True, False, False);<br/>
    Flag := SetWallStyle(LNewObj, p__NewOpeningWS, 0, 0);<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

<br/>
We&#39;ve got many bases/plates for trusses I created in &quot;truss vertical&quot; and work fine since VWX2020. <br/>
<br/>
With the new function &quot;magnet&quot;, I try to have more than one &quot;Top 3D&quot; magnet in some of them, like my real bases/plates trusses. <br/>
<br/>
I can attach easily my trusses on those multiples &quot;Top 3D&quot; magnets, I saw the magnetic red line and it works fine on every magnets. <br/>
<br/>
But when I run the function &quot;Select system objects&quot; only 1 truss is selected with the base. It&#39;s always the first Top 3D magnet created, trusses on other magnets are not selected, so bracework won&#39;t run on it.<br/>
<br/>
My case is similar to the Mod Trusses I saw in JustinVH video presentation of magnets.<br/>

It seems that when truss pickup is inserted within truss and hoist, its weight isn&#39;t calculate withe the hoist and trusses weights in braceworks.<br/>
<br/>
Question : I didn&#39;t find documentation, SlingRecord seems to need weight information in g isn&#39;t it ? I can&#39;t verify that because of the braceworks issue of this ticket. I deduce that with truss pickup online library. Am I wrong ?

<br/>
I found an issue with the bounding box of truss objects with a hanging that are inserted if the &quot;Modify truss object color&quot; setting is checked in the spotlight preferences. <br/>
<br/>
Such a truss object can be selected and shows its info in the OIP, but it will not show a bounding box when selected if it has a hanging angle other than 0. <br/>
<br/>
There seems to be no way to revert the truss object to a state where it shows a bounding box again. Even if other trusses are inserted with the setting unchecked. These new trusses will work als normal, but the ones in question will not show a bounding box. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed the behaviour in a new 2021 file. The behaviour is the same in 2022. Opening the file in 2022 the problem remains. <br/>

The other issue with this function is that whereas the same function automatically generates with Lighting Devices, this function needs a &quot;nudge&quot; by reassigning Class Attributes in the Attributes Palette. <br/>

It would be good if the two similar functions worked in the same way as each other.<br/>

<br/>
In the &quot;Truss inventory&quot; dialog box (found via the &quot;Replace Truss&quot; dialog box), when you use the export button to send the inventory out, the resulting csv file uses semicolons as the delimiter.<br/>
<br/>
Both Excel and MacOS&#39; Numbers import the file fine.<br/>
<br/>
After making edits, when one tries to either &quot;Save As&quot; or &quot;Export&quot; to a csv file, <br/>
<br/>
Neither MS Excel nor Numbers offer an option to export using the same semicolon and the VW Truss import refuses to recognize the comma as a delimiter. Thus, the &quot;Import&quot; button does not complete its task.<br/>
<br/>
From our help file: https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2022/eng/VW2022_Guide/Braceworks/Managing_truss_inventory.htm?rhhlterm=inventory&amp;rhsearch=inventory<br/>
<br/>
_If desired, inventory changes can be made in an external inventory program or spreadsheet program. Click Export to create a .csv file, make the changes, and then click Import to import the edited .csv file back into Vectorworks._<br/>
<br/>
_When editing the spreadsheet, do not change the name of the symbol. The name must remain intact to re-import the data._<br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround.<br/>
Exporting the Excel file with commas.<br/>
Opening the file in a text editor and doing a find &amp; replace to change the commas to semicolons, and saving.<br/>
VW does work when the semicolons are there.<br/>
<br/>
Either we need to change how VW recognizes the semicolon. Or, we need to add the workaround to the help file.<br/>

for example if the cable tool auto numbering is set to to label the cables in the chain A1 then all distributors inserted using this option should also be given the ID of A1<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if it is intended to be able to double click on the style to activate the cable tool and start drawing with that cable style (like you can with many other Spotlight plug in objects) but doing so definitely shouldn&#39;t activate the NURBS tool<br/>

<br/>
Normally when cabling lights in this fashion in the real world the twofer or threefer distributor object is placed directly above the first light in the chain and the light is plugged directly into it without and extra cable. The chain is then continued to the next light with a cable and a second splitter would only be used if there was a third light in the chain<br/>
<br/>
In contrast we are adding a splitter at the first light, inserting 2 cable to the light (at most one should be inserted) and a third cable runs to the next light in the chain. <br/>
At the next light another splitter is always inserted not matter whether there are more lights in the chain or not. If the it is not the last light in the chain then again 2 cable are inserted to connect the splitter to the light and a third to the next light in the chain.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This results in a large number of extra cables and splitter that will need to be manually deleted from the file by the user<br/>

<br/>
when doing a Braceworks calculation in this file, the FD34 will be shown in the Cross Section Workload Overview. The FD43 will not.<br/>
<br/>
If I take a look at the Cross Section Workload (Braceworks-Menu &gt; Ceoss Section Workload...) the FD43 exists. Even in the Load Overview the FD43 is existing.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to be a bug for me.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
insert a distribution object on the ground, a truss system with U shape configuration (see attached image) a cable path leading to one end of the truss and a breakout distribution object at one end of the truss system.<br/>
<br/>
activate the cable tool<br/>
<br/>
choose the Han16 cable style, single connection mode and turn on the new auto insertion mode toggle<br/>
<br/>
click on the distributor on the ground and then on the breakout.<br/>
<br/>
the newly created cable will enter the cable path, follow it to the truss, follow part of the truss system and then jump of the truss system to go directly to the breakout (see the attached image). The desired behavior is that the cable follows the truss system to the breakout without jumping off.<br/>

Effectively this means that any consumer device that requires 2 different types of input is not supported, for example a vl-1100 which requires two power inputs one of which is from an external dimmer.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
import a lighting device into an empty file<br/>
<br/>
edit its 2D or 3D component to add any combination of consumer and/or input electrical components with unique names<br/>
<br/>
insert the lighting device<br/>

activate the cable tool using any mode<br/>

draw 2 cables connecting to the lighting device (ending at the lighting device)<br/>

look in the lighting devices power infomation input connection drop-downs, only the first input will document a connection, the second input will always display as empty!<br/>

If the enclosed file is exported to MVR using the default setting (All objects in the Drawing) then the computer will either shut down or you get a message saying &quot;Your system has run out of application memory&quot;.<br/>
It get&#39;s this message at 134GB of memory used by Vectorworks on a 32GB RAM iMac.<br/>
<br/>
If the option to export &#39;Visible Objects&#39; is used then it does export. The file itself doesn&#39;t seem that big with 168,597 objects hence why I am reporting this.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps &#39;Visible Objects&#39; should be the recommended/default option? Maybe a warning dialogue could come up when choosing the option &#39;All objects in the Drawing&#39;? (Are you really sure you want to do this?!).<br/>

I&#39;ve attached two short videos showing the issues I&#39;m seeing and I&#39;ve done these tests on both Windows and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
For this test, I have been working with Tomcat and Christie Truss.<br/>
 # Open a new blank document.<br/>
 # Open the resource manager and navigate to Tomcat TC-1212 truss.<br/>
 # Choose a 10-foot stick of truss by double-clicking to activate the truss insertion tool.<br/>
 # Change the tool to insert a continuous line of truss.<br/>
 # Place approximately 40 feet of truss.<br/>
 ** Once placed and without deselecting,<br/>
 # click on the end of the 40 foot run of truss to extend it.<br/>
 ** You should see the Braceworks red line indicating it will snap and attach to the end of the truss run.<br/>
 # Draw your line out to place another 20 feet of truss.<br/>
 ** You should now have a 60 foot run of truss. Take a close look at the connection point between the 40 foot and added 20 feet. Are they aligned properly?<br/>
<br/>
If it did align properly, please repeat this a few more times. I&#39;ve had mixed results with more failures than successes.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat in ISO view.<br/>

Though I have set this to insert the Multicable, the cable tool is inserting the appropriate cable based upon the Next open circuit in the Distro, regardless of the cable chosen.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the cable being placed in this example, the originating distro is dictating the cable being placed. The Distro (Breakout) is not being taken into account. <br/>
  <br/>
 On the one hand, it makes sense that the connector dictates the type of cable being inserted. On the other hand, considering that the originating distributor has three types of cable connectors (cam lock, Edison, &amp; multicable) then the cable tool should defer to the second distributor object which has a single input of a multicable, along with its six Edison outputs.<br/>
  <br/>
 In my example, since I had purposely selected a multicable, I would have thought that the cable tool would seek out and choose the next available multicable output. What is happening now is that the tool was simply choosing the next available circuit regardless of the connector.

Choosing to repatch the item to another circuit draws an additional cable. This is not something we want.<br/>

We would want the repatch process to check if a cable exists and simply use this same cable. Or, we want the cable to delete itself in favor of the new cable being inserted.

I&#39;ve found and resolve an issue with all my circle truss librairies. Maybe this is already documented somewhere, I&#39;ve got this trouble for a long time before v2022.<br/>
<br/>
When truss symbols contains groups in their 3D, and when you roll them, some of groups disapear on screen.<br/>
<br/>
See my screenshots and file. On the Ø6m circle truss, there is no group inside 3D symbols, and in the Ø8m there are few groups in it.<br/>
<br/>
Similar issue with Truss pickup, I create another tickets for that.

Two questions here: <br/>
Why do I get these messages. imho everything looks fine<br/>
Why do the lines go to the top left corner?<br/>
Is it a bug or am I missing something here.<br/>

The position field for the Distributor has &quot;B Truss&quot; entered into the position field.<br/>
<br/>
The jumper cables have inserted &quot;Cable Bridge 4&quot; into their position fields.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the two think they are in different positions.<br/>
<br/>
Only the Distributor has claimed a location. The cable&#39;s location field has not been indicated by the cabling operation and is blank.<br/>
<br/>
Both objects have the term &quot;position&quot; and the term &quot;location.&quot; Yet, they are not matching these two terms as far as their physical locations in the rigging/lighting system.<br/>
<br/>
Since &quot;Position&quot; is used across the lighting tools and often designates a hanging position, I believe we should have objects use &quot;Position&quot; across the board. The &quot;Location&quot; seems to denote an object&#39;s location with a rigging system. A Hanging Position can be part of a rigging system and is at a location. Objects hanging on the hanging position are also at locations within the overall rigging system.

In the enclosed file you can see that there are two simple truss systems with and LED as a load. In the OIP if the roll is made to 180º then the LED screen flips around and goes up in the z. <br/>
Spinning truss can be common when designing rigs and this means that the entire system has to then be rebuilt.<br/>

<br/>
We have had reports from a Spotlight user for his frustrations with connecting Prolyte Truss systems within Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
We have been able to replicate this issue and believe this might be a bug. <br/>
<br/>
When trying to attach a corner piece of truss to a straight truss, if you want to connect using the bottom part of the T for instance this looks like it will connect as it should and then defaults to a certain orientation. Which isn&#39;t what is needed. <br/>
<br/>
Please find an example file and a video of the issue. Please let me know if there is anything i can send. <br/>
<br/>
Any help on this would be great. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>

This is inconsistent with how Create Similar Object works in other contexts; typically you&#39;re able to immediately draw more of the SAME object.

<br/>
not sure if it is a bug or just a change that has been made between 2020 and 2021.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020 I can create a calculation Report and type in every Information about this project.<br/>
<br/>
When creating an additional report, all information are still in this form.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 and 2022, these information get lost.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda a regression.<br/>
<br/>
Change it to Enhancement, when changes were made on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and stay healthy!<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards<br/>

<br/>
in 2020, the &quot;Assign to Class:&quot;-option works perfectly fine for trusses.<br/>
When assigning trusses to different Classes, the obects are in these classes after inserting.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2021, this option has no effect anymore. <br/>
I tested it in 2022 aswell.<br/>
<br/>
What is the reason that this has been changed?<br/>
Is it possible get this feature back for trusses?<br/>
<br/>
Since it was working for 2020 (even when the options in the spotlight settings exist) I mark this as regression.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and best Regards<br/>
Alex

I have one hanging position with six lights. The history of this document includes my connecting the two Altman units to the small dimmer pack. I had feeder cable running from the supply to the dimmer pack. I then wanted to start again with the cabling so I deleted all the cables. The web interface retained its visual representation of all the connections until after I restarted Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached video I show that I insert a new power supply and I then add a feeder cable from the supply to the small dimmer pack. The web interface then shows one of the lighting units is connected to one of the Edison connections and its corresponding dimmer. Note, however, there are no Edison jumpers in the drawing. I had deleted them all.<br/>
<br/>
To confirm that there are no other cables, run the cable worksheet report command. It should only list the feeder cable.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, deleting cable should break their connections and allow users a fresh start.

<br/>
When used each cable in the chain should have the same cable run ID and update the lighting device with the same data, i.e  the circuit name and circuit number fields should be filled.<br/>
<br/>
currently the only the first cable and lighting device in a daisy chain is labeled or receives data, all subsequent cables and devices in the chain have noe cable run ID (cable objects) or circuit data (lighting devices)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
insert a breakout or plug box distributor and give it an ID<br/>
<br/>
insert several lighting devices<br/>
<br/>
activate the cable tool,<br/>
<br/>
select the appropriate jumper cable to go with the chosen breakout<br/>
<br/>
chose daisy chain mode<br/>

turn on auto numbering and configure it to use<br/>

prepend source distributor name to prefix<br/>
<br/>
append breakout output  to suffix<br/>

and<br/>
<br/>
apply same numbering to all<br/>
<br/>
insert the cable chain from the breakout to lighting devices normally.<br/>
<br/>
only the first cable will have a cable run ID and only the first fixture will have the circuit fields filled in.

This is noticed because we are using tri truss. Attached are two identical files saved in 2021 and 2022. They contain a truss section 3m long that is point down on the page and another imported 1m point down section not on the page.<br/>
<br/>
Once selected go to the Replace Truss button in the OIP. Change the 3m =0 and 1m =3 to replace the 3m single section with 3 x 1m sections. Once replaced note that the truss is no longer hybrid and is now point up.<br/>
<br/>
Also note in the Relace truss dialogue in 2022 it seems to list all the items in the library including however these have not been imported in the file, and note that they seem doubled up and have an &#39;H&#39; after each one which implies height not length which is what the numbers mean. This is very different to 2021 and odd.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter

 # Select a stick of truss from the schematic view on the right.<br/>
 # In the OIP click on select system objects.<br/>
<br/>
Notice the odd behavior in that all the system objects except for the one still highlighted in this schematic view show they are selected.<br/>
<br/>
Expected result was to see all truss in the schematic view to be shown selected. Resulting in the ability to work with the truss in that view.<br/>
<br/>
Second choice would be to have all truss in both views show selected. <br/>
<br/>
Third choice would be to show only the actual truss on the left show selected. This could require a complete change of view for the user if the original truss is located elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Tested in both Mac and Windows.<br/>
<br/>
Checked in 2021. The Schematic View does not offer the choice to select system objects.

Note: If this Symbol is made into a Group, this workflow works as expected.  Group and Extrude Edit mode does not turn off the Clip Cube.  An Extrude and a Group have been provided in the file to help test the difference seen.<br/>
<br/>
This same workflow was done in Vectorworks 2022 through 2019 and they all work the same.  Maybe turning the Clip Cube off is WAD for Edit Symbol, but the Tool Bar button should not show active when the Clip Cube is not present.<br/>
<br/>
*An additional difference (possible bug) seen is upon Exit Symbol/Group/Extrude: With the Clip Cube turned OFF in Edit.  A Symbol and Extrude will return with the Clip Cube ON.  A Group will return with the Clip Cube OFF.  Should turning the Clip Cube ON/OFF in Edit mode affect if the Clip Cube is ON/OFF upon Exit?  - Filling an addition bug for this issue, just wanted to note it here since seen in the video.<br/>

In VW 2019, note that the source shape is still within the bounds of the Clip Cube and can be selected.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2020, note that the source shape is outside of the bounds of the Clip Cube so it can only be selected with Select All.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens in VW 2021 and 2022.

This same workflow was done in Vectorworks 2022 through 2019 and they all work the same. <br/>
<br/>
Should turning the Clip Cube ON/OFF in Edit Mode affect whether the Clip Cube is ON/OFF upon Exit?  I would expect these three Edit Modes to work the same with this feature, but I am not sure which is WAD.  Figured it was worth bringing up.

                Multi-View - Closing Project Sharing Dialog During Inspection Mode Causes Sheet Graphics Error

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and Project file are attached. The file contains a bunch of different object types and has Multi-View enabled, with a sheet layer active in the bottom-right pane.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-In the top-left pane, select all the objects and modify/check them out<br/>
-In the bottom-right pane, open the PS dialog<br/>
-In the Objects tab, double-click any item to inspect it<br/>
-Click OK to close the PS dialog while in the inspection mode<br/>
-Zoom/pan on the sheet<br/>
<br/>
Note that the sheet shows a series of random artifacts at certain zoom levels.<br/>
<br/>
If I inspect the objects from the Commit List dialog (and then close/cancel) I don&#39;t see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
If I close the PS dialog without entering the inspection mode I don&#39;t see the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The double-click inspection behavior from the PS dialog was added as part of the T02209 task. I don&#39;t think this bug is related to that task though, it probably just exposed an existing problem with Multi-View. <br/>

I&#39;ve attached the file that is not going to Shaded (Octogon Groundplan) I&#39;m also attaching another file (though not the one in the video) that does respect that preference setting.

Steps to re-create (or just open the test file):<br/>
 # Draw a rectangle parallel to the xz plane<br/>
 # Go to Model &gt; Sweep and create a sweep that results in a quarter circle<br/>
 # Notice that the edges of the circle are all smooth<br/>
 # Create a second extrude object and move it inside the sweep object<br/>
 # Open the context menu and execute the command &quot;Subtract Solids...&quot;<br/>
 # Notice that the edges of the circle are no longer smooth, but angular<br/>
<br/>
This is a bug that occurs for both the SDK function and the context menu command &quot;Subtract Solids&quot;. A test file is attached, with both objects before applying the &quot;Subtract solids&quot; command and after.

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if these kine of reports does make sense. But because it is a brand new feature (Metal) I would like to report it anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
If I compare 2021 and 2022 on my Mac (See attached screenshots) I can notice that navigating in 2022 feels not that smooth as in 2021. In some cases the computer also &quot;stick&quot; and I have to force quit and restart the whole iMac.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is not that easy to reproduce but I would like to report this with my specs anyhow.<br/>

They are constantly having slowness issues and crashing. <br/>
<br/>
Example crash on report below:<br/>
<br/>
[https://analytics.vectorworks.net/crashes?crashId=7907106]<br/>
<br/>
[https://analytics.vectorworks.net/crashes?crashId=7905496]<br/>
<br/>
Please find attached two users SPX files. <br/>
<br/>
I have recommended they update to the latest OS version 11.6 <br/>
<br/>
I will also ask them to install the latest service pack for 2021. <br/>
<br/>
I also have a link to an example project if needed. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions very much welcome. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen

This regression looks like it happened long ago somewhere between these builds:<br/>
VW23.0.6(463953)-SP6: Good<br/>
VW24.0.6(522773)-SP6: Bad<br/>
<br/>
 I did not do extensive testing so there may be more recent builds where it worked again.<br/>
<br/>
*NOTE:* Regardless of how old this regression is, this is a very serious problem with no reasonable workarounds.

                DLVPs not exporting properly to IFC
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This file is a simple example of using DLVPs to &quot;copy&quot; floors across multiple stories. This is typically what we recommend to users who are creating multi-story buildings that have identical floors. The file has the second floor modeled and floors 3-6 are DLVPs. I exported to IFC and imported that IFC into a blank Vectorworks file and there are weird objects. There are centerlines of walls that exist well above the wall itself. Each subsequent story has the offset of the centerlines from the walls larger than the story below.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note: Because the 2nd floor was copied, each floor above had to be moved down the height of the 2nd floor from the ground plane. This seems to be an annoying but necessary step for working with DLVPs.

In the early stages of the project, they were able to open the IFC file, but as the project went along and the IFC file got bigger, they stopped being able to open it. The IFC file is currently 705 Mb and the Revit user says that when they try to open the file, Revit hangs for hours and they eventually just give up. I know that GKV set their 3D Conversion Resolution to Low, but thus IFC file still seems VERY large.<br/>

What&#39;s going on here and how do I avoid it? I&#39;ve messed around with the IFC version in this file in the past so the wall may well have been &#39;W2&#39; originally, perhaps when it was set to IFC 2x3.

<br/>
Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Site Model and a Planar Pad modifier.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Update the Site Model<br/>
-Edit the path of the modifier<br/>
-Fillet the sides as shown (I did this in two separate steps)<br/>
-Update the Site Model again<br/>
-Change the sides of the modifier to Fixed Slope instead of Retaining, then update the Site Model again<br/>
<br/>
In the movie the freeze occurs at this point, but I&#39;ve also seen it happen earlier in the process. If you don&#39;t see it at this point, try changing the shape of the modifier (Add Surface or Reshape) and update again and it should eventually freeze.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to duplicate this on Windows so it might be Mac-only.

I don&#39;t know yet if the issue is due to a bug with Vectorworks or my workspace script, however, Vectorworks should have a mechanism to check the workspace, detect the error that is preventing Vectorworks from loading, and advise the user that a default workspace will be selected.<br/>
<br/>
The partner installer makes workspace editing via script potentially more common, so greater integrity checks need to be in place.

                (Maxon Fix) FBX not exporting filtered textures correctly
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Currently when you export an FBX, any Renderworks Textures that are utilizing a &quot;Filter Color&quot; within the image color shader are being exported without the filter color applied. That means when they&#39;re imported into another program, those surfaces look white/greyscale (assuming the original image was greyscale which is often the case in such scenarios).<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the exported texture should include the filter color baked into the texture. And if the filter color is set to &quot;Use Object Fill&quot; then multiple textures should be created in the exported FBX, one for each color fill being used by objects with that texture.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
See the attached screen grabs showing the difference between a model in Vectorworks and the exported FBX (as seen in Blender):<br/>
<br/>
-The yellow siding looks correct because it&#39;s using a yellow image with no filter.<br/>
<br/>
-The salmon siding is not correct. It looks white because the FBX export isn&#39;t taking into account the filter color for that texture.<br/>
<br/>
-The green and purple surfaces also look white - in this case they&#39;re using the same Vectorworks texture as each other, but the exported FBX should create both a green texture and a purple texture.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A similar issue was recently solved for Unreal export as part of VB-176642. Exporting the FBX should function very much the same way as the fixed Unreal export functions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
FBXs are important in the workflow between art departments and VFX houses on films, and fixing this would be greatly beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

(This same issue may apply to other export types as well)

<br/>
the commands Flip Vertical and Flip Horizontal seem to work not proper in a rotated plan since Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>
If you perform one of these commands twice the object should be at its original position. In Vectorworks 2022 (and 2021) the objects are displaced afterwards.<br/>
<br/>

                TSectionCreator::Regenerate and other leaks : &quot;Lack of Memory&quot; error when rendering viewports
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This week I&#39;ve gotten the following error message a few times:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One or more operations were aborted due to lack of memory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each time the scenario has been when I&#39;ve selected two or more sheet layer perspective viewports set to a custom render mode and hit Update, then the error happens a minute or two later. Usually one viewport finishes rendering successfully while the others fail.<br/>
<br/>
All viewports also have Image Effects applied.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen every single time, just after working in the program for a while.<br/>
<br/>
After I click OK on the error message, one viewport turns into a grey box with a black X. Sometimes the error pops up multiple times, seemingly once per viewport, as each one individually fails and turns grey. <br/>
<br/>
To fix the issue, I restart Vectorworks and re-render the failed viewports, and things work fine for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed upon re-starting that the viewports that failed no longer have Image Effects applied.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only been working in one file this week so I haven&#39;t been able to test if it&#39;s a more universal issue or file-specific. Unfortunately it&#39;s a model that has an incredibly strict NDA so I can&#39;t upload it, but it&#39;s also not particularly complex so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s causing the issue.

*Note*:  Editing the Section In-place and rotating the view shows additional line markers at the end of each stair&#39;s walk path.  This is curious since the stair at the top of the viewport looks like it displays that same marker (when seen from the sheet layer).<br/>

<br/>
On the sheet layer, there are section viewports. Data tags are only visible when rendering mode is set to shaded, and not in hidden line rendering. Observe that Windowtags are visible in both renderings mode. Data tags are visible when zooming inn and out for a short period of time<br/>
<br/>
To make the text readable in the shaded viewport it is necessary to have a the design layer in a high resolution (300p or more). Text in hidden line are crisp even in low resolution <br/>
<br/>
My idea was to have stacked viewports with a shaded background for shadows and color information, and a front viewport with crisp text and lines <br/>

 # Notice most of the earlier cues we saw are now not working, until you get to some that do....for some reason the color cues always seem to get some fixtures &#39;back on line&#39; and working again (with the exception of the Source 4 lekos - the first cue). <br/>
 # After ending the session with the Q Light Controller console, you will see that some Lighting Devices in the Vision file are still broken (ETC Source 4, Elation Impression, Martin Atomic 3000) and won&#39;t turn when selected. <br/>

                Acceptance Test Cue 46 - possible issue in VSN files

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This issue was found when running Acceptance Test on Vision 2022 Build 613087 using Vectorworks 2022 Build 613171<br/>
<br/>
The issue is with Cue 46 - the shutters are supposed to come in from the right and left to create a &#39;strip&#39; shape.  What is being seen, _*in some cases*_, is more of a pie piece shape.  This was an issue back in 26.0.0 Build 549907 (VB-171314)<br/>
<br/>
However, it isn&#39;t that simple.  This seems to only be in VSN files, the MVR or ESC files that they originate from look correct.  This is very true on Mac (100% of the time), on Windows it is less consistent (first found on Windows, now I am having trouble recreate it).<br/>
<br/>
I have opened files with this issue in older builds and the problems is there, so it seems to be more at the file level than an issue with the Vision build. (??)<br/>
<br/>
+Incorrect:+<br/>
<br/>
*TestFile_v2022 826.vsn* - _came from MVR file type on Windows_<br/>
<br/>
*TestFile from ESC.vsn* - _came from ESC file on MacOS_<br/>
<br/>
*TestFile_v2022.vsn -* _came from MVR file type on MacOS_<br/>
<br/>
Correct:<br/>
<br/>
*TestFile_v2022 826 from MVR.vsn* &amp; *TestFile_v2022 from ESC.vsn* - _These files are examples of inconsistent result on Windows._ <br/>
<br/>
*TestFile_v2022 826.esc* &amp; *TestFile_v2022.mvr* - _These files show that from a clean export from Vectorworks Cue 46 looks correct - these look the same on both MacOS &amp; Windows._<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this is not the most defined bug report.  I am having a hard time seeing what is going on here with such varying results.  I did my best to break it down to the basics.  I thought fresh a set of eyes might help . . . happy to discuss and test further.

<br/>
Existing Tree tools offers country customization. For our german version, we do not use the parameter DBH, which is the trunk diameter, instead we do use the trunk perimeter, in german Stammumfang.<br/>
In Data Visualization there is only the trunk diameter offered as a parameter but not the trunk perimeter.<br/>
In a german version it should be the perimeter. For me it is okay, when both, the diameter and perimeter would be offered. This means for you just to add the trunk perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
See video.<br/>

<br/>
If you have a file, where allready a user origin exists, it&#39;s not possible to import a shape file to these coordinates (if you don&#39;t use the georeferencing system in the existing file).<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1. Open the File &quot;Import Shape&quot; (this file has a user origin)<br/>
2. Import the Shape File &quot;Strasse&quot;<br/>
3. Compare the coordinates of the objects with the file &quot;Import Shape Result&quot; which is the result of a import without a user origin respectively the user origin was set to match the georeferecing system after the import of the shape file.<br/>
<br/>

I have created a worksheet which pulls out the data from the Stake record. This includes Easting and Northing. The file unit of measure is meters, so I would expect the Easting and Northing to be reported in meters. However, I have also included the X Coordinate and Y Coordinate. You will see in the worksheet that the values in the Easting and Northing fields have the decimal point 3 places to the right, compared to the correct values in the X coordinate and Y coordinate.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a reason for this? I am concerned that such a report could lead to wild inaccuracy if the client expects the Easting and Northing values to be correct.

<br/>
In the sample file you will see an arced Pipe object that has a Perimeter length equal to approximately 37 feet. This is confirmed by drafting an arc object, and seeing that the arc length is the exact same dimension.<br/>
<br/>
In a worksheet, built to pull in Pipe objects and report their Name, Size, and Length, the field =Pipe.Length returns a dimension of over 108 feet...almost 3x the actual length, while the function =PERIM returns the correct dimension/value.<br/>
<br/>
Upon further testing, it appears that this BUG only exists on pipe objects that contain an arc somewhere along the segment length. Straight pipe objects return accurate values with both the =Pipe.Length field and the =PERIM function.<br/>
<br/>
This is obviously a big reporting bug that can have significant impacts in quantity estimates. We need this fixed, but until then, we will only be using the =PERIM function for estimating/returning accurate pipe dimensions in a drawing.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the poly and run the &quot;Create Objects from Shapes&quot; command<br/>
-Enable the &quot;Show properties dialog&quot; checkbox in the dialog that appears<br/>
-In the Properties dialog, choose &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; and then choose the custom layer from the &quot;Use objects on:&quot; menu<br/>
<br/>
Note that the layer doesn&#39;t actually get assigned, so when it tries to do the fit it results in an empty object showing in 3D.

<br/>
maybe this issue is not a bug, but a wish. Nevertheless it is from one of our big german customers, so we can&#39;t ignore. At least I need a good explanation for the customer about this issue to satisfy them.<br/>
<br/>
Customer uses hatches to illustrate a house facade. In order to match the facade the customer uses local mapping on that hatch. When exported to dwg the hatch gets scaled in AutoCAD.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a bug or WAD? If bug, please fix it. If not a bug, then please consider it a wish. And maybe you can give me some arguments for the customer about this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Please find a testfile and screenshot from AutoCAD.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Klaus Lüttich

In the attached .vwx test file we have 2 rectangles.<br/>

The Red Rectangle has a Fill Opacity set to 50%.<br/>
<br/>
The Blue Rectangle also has a Fill Opacity set to 50% but its using the Class Fill Opacity.<br/>
<br/>
We export the file to DWG and import it back to Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Rectangle retains the 50% Fill Opacity.<br/>
<br/>
The Blue Rectangle loses the 50% Fill Opacity and now has instead 100% just like its Class.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that the Blue Rectangle should also retain its Fill Opacity, even if using Class Fill Opacity. Please take a look at this. Thank you.

The workaround for the customer is not to use publish but to use export command. When only exporting one dwg this might be good, but if the customer exports a handful of dwg, publish command is required. And then the export could take hours.

The enclosed file originated in v2019 but has been rebuilt in v2022 via layer import. However it still exhibits this strange problem. If the option &#39;Flattened 2D Graphics&#39; is checked then when reimported or viewed in a viewer the objects have rotated 90º.<br/>

The export fails to show in proper way page-based symbol in dwg.<br/>
The &quot;page-based&quot; symbol used in a workplace scales to the same size as &quot;world-based&quot;.<br/>
The &quot;page-based&quot; symbol used in an annotation mode in a sheet viewport scales according to the sheet viewport scale, so it is much smaller than other objects.<br/>
I prepared a simple file showing this issue with a pdf file export as expected output and dwg (and print screen from dwg viewer) with a result of an export.<br/>

Enclosed is a dwg of a piece of curved 500mm Box truss. When viewed in the ACAD online viewer (see enclosed screenshot) it looks very good. When imported into Vectorworks the result is very bad as you can see. This is very unusual as the dwg translation process is usually so very good!<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if the Vectorworks 3D conversion prefs are set to Very High.<br/>

This Error doesn&#39;t seem to have any purpose, because the export result doesn&#39;t seem to be affected in any way.

<br/>
1. If a hardscape is drawn in &#39;Class A&#39; the hardscape *forever* retains that class even if the entire hardscape is placed into &#39;Class B&#39; afterwards and all attributes set by that class. <br/>
<br/>
There is no way to purge the document of &#39;Class A&#39; even if it is not being used anymore. It stays hidden within the Floor part of the 3D slab which you can see once ungrouped.<br/>
<br/>
2. If the 3D component of a Slab is using the &lt;Object Class&gt; for it&#39;s attributes, then even though &#39;Class B&#39; has used at creation set for both 2D and 3D attributes, it seems that even if &#39;make all attributes by class&#39; is checked in the Slab Component dialogue, some attributes appear set by &#39;Class A&#39;, especially textures. <br/>
<br/>
The Use class for the texture shows the incorrect texture that is not set by the &lt;Object Class&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The preview of the Slab Component shows the 2D fill for &#39;Class A&#39; as opposed to what has been set by &#39;Class B&#39;. Even then, in Top Plan the 2D attributes show incorrectly (white in the example file) rather than what is indicated in the Attributes palette with all Attributes indicating they are set by class.<br/>
<br/>
File and movie enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

p.AddVertex(1189.39701, 993.89876,eVertexType_Corner);<br/>
	<br/>
VWPolygon2D p_polygonized;<br/>
	<br/>
p.GetPolygonized(p_polygonized);<br/>
<br/>
returns p_polygonized with a huge gap at the end:<br/>

<br/>
I am getting to grips with the lovely new Site Modifiers, so please brace yourselves for a series of probably stupid questions. I am making the New Feature Video for the task, so need to understand it well and work out the best way to show it off.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, I have created a simple Planar Pad and I am experimenting with the different Sides options. To start with, I am just applying the sides option to All Sides.<br/>
<br/>
My site model is set to be modified by Visible Layers Only. I have duplicated my Planar Pad onto different design layers, and on each layer have changed the Sides definition. The idea is that I will be able to easily cycle through them all using Layer Visibility to control the active modifier.<br/>
<br/>
At some point along the way, these strange lines appeared across my model and I cannot get rid of them. Any ideas? The contours have developed strange wiggles too.<br/>
<br/>
Could it be because my Existing Site was created from a flat polygon, and then scultped, rather than using source data? <br/>
<br/>
Any advice gratefully received.

In VW 2021 the old Plant Style dialog also didn&#39;t show shadows in the preview (while the Tick Mark options didn&#39;t exist), so this might not technically be a regression.

I do get a beta undo error 4 with plants in a customer file. The customer complained that he cannot change the symbol of a plant. I looked into the file and I guess it is a single case. The plants must be very old and must have been converted, so I guess. But I can be mistaken. Please have a look. Before that please watch my video.<br/>

I caught the bug! It&#39;s a bit elusive, but once you understand it, it&#39;s easy to replicate.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to the script editor either when used for Marionette nodes or when used for plain old script resources.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce: (see the video)<br/>
1) Open a script editor (use the Marionette pass node for ease of use)<br/>
2) change the editor size in such way that there is no vertical scrollbar (because the whole script is visible)<br/>
3) close the editor<br/>
4) open the editor (again, use the Marionette pass node for ease of use)<br/>
--&gt; see that the color highlighting does not work for the whole script, but once you type something somewhere see the color highlighting expands to the whole script<br/>

Please ignore the user folder bits of the video. I tested the bug with a brand new user folder and it still was reproducible.

                Data Visualization Pen Thickness Gets Reverted When Line Type is Changed

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the DV scheme and edit one of the overrides<br/>
-Change the Pen Thickness<br/>
-Now change the Pen Style<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Pen Thickness reverts to its original value.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like VW is storing a separate thickness value for each type of Pen Style (Solid, Line Type, and Pattern). Other areas of VW store the thickness as an independent variable so this seems like a bug.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2021.

Maybe it is important to mention that &quot;unified view&quot; was turned off during the migration of this document between version 2019 and 2021. The problems came to existence after the migration.

I don&#39;t see this problem with other plugins that use embedded symbols (for example the Data Tag).<br/>

In VW 2020 and VW 2021, the problem happens regardless of the Nav Graphics.<br/>

In VW 2018, this worked fine regardless of the Nav Graphics.<br/>

We could not find a fix for this. Seems like on of the risers is merged into the mid section isle and the side of the stair would want to go further but it needs to bend early to join with the geometry from the risers on the lower section of the stair. <br/>
<br/>

At the moment user creates a extruded cube to add solids and covers the corner but it makes the stairs to become a solid instead of &quot;stair&quot; <br/>

<br/>
Please see the attached file. It contains a simple site model, with a vicious slope, and 2 pads. The site model has slope categories enabled. The document units are metres all round (length, area and volume). I have run the standard report Site Slope Analysis, which pulls in the &#39;Site Model Slope Analysis&#39;.&#39;Projected Area&#39; and &#39;Site Model Slope Analysis&#39;.&#39;Surface Area&#39; values. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the file being in metres, and the site model set to display areas and volumes in metres, the worksheet reports these values in millimeters. <br/>
<br/>
Clearly, we can divide by a million to get metres (or whatever is needed to get to feet), but it would be better if the values in these fields were in the chosen document units for display in the worksheet. Otherwise, someone unaware of this, who doesn&#39;t look too closely, could make expensive mistakes.

<br/>
I&#39;ve included a couple screenshots and Vectorworks files to help show this. It seems to happen more when using larger rafters (we can see it happen when using 2&quot;x8&quot; rafters, one of the default options in the roof framer). By default my fascia height was about 7&quot;, but changing it to 1&quot; or smaller allowed me to see this issue.<br/>
<br/>
This may be intentional, but I&#39;m not entirely certain why this would change from version to version. Please let me know if there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing that could cause this.<br/>
<br/>
This was brought up by a user calling in; their name is David Quillin (ddqarch@comcast.net) should we need to reach back out to them.<br/>
<br/>
Any additional information or news on this is appreciated. Thanks for your time, and have a great day! :)

<br/>
I have most researched this in VW2021, but I did confirm it also acts the same in VW2022B3.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file on Design Layer 2 there are two viewport, once from Design Layer 1 (rectangle on right) the other one referenced into the file (octagon on the left).<br/>
<br/>
There are two Data Tag Styles in the file. One displays both the Viewport Source and the Crop Visibility. The other displays only the Crop Visbility.<br/>
<br/>
Open the attached file. Select the Data Tag tool. Set the data tag to either of the Data Tag Styles in the drawing. Select the Select Eligible Objects (third) mode. Both viewports will highlight. Click on either and the data tag will be attached to both as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Delete the Data Tags and switch to the Select Single Object (second) mode. Regardless of the setting for From or To, the Data Tag tool will not find either of the viewports.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem I have noticed is that the Source gets lost from viewports. When I first started the file, I had the referenced file name for the referenced viewport and Current File for the local viewport. At some point I lost both sources. They showed as blank in the Source field of the OIP. Updating the Reference brought the Source of the Referenced Viewport, but I have not figured out how to get the Current file back.

This is at the early stages of a project where you need to be able to change height and use of large groups quickly. The subpart reporting takes care of the totals (love it!).<br/>
<br/>
This works really well, but it seems like the division between the components is a bit of a hit or miss - sometimes the lines are not there. It seems to be a bit more stable if you create them with the Hardscape tool instead of creating from shapes, but it&#39;s the latter that will be the workflow.

<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Open the attached &quot;Testfile 20210125_01&quot; in Vectorworks 2021<br/>
 # Export the file to IFC 2x3 (IMPORTANT: Turn on &quot;1st Level Space Boundaries&quot;)<br/>
 # Open the exported IFC in Solibri<br/>
<br/>
As you can see you get a Solibri error message during file opening. If you export the same file without &quot;1st Level Space Boundaries&quot; the error does not occur.

For IFC 2x3, the decomposition at export is working correctly with Data Manager default settings, it just doesn’t show in the data manager dialog. Also, the BaseQuantities are being exported and are mapped correctly but don’t show in the data manager default settings dialog.<br/>

<br/>
Vectorworks allows the IFC BaseQuantites Set to be activated in the OIP Data Pane for a selected stair object. Also, Vectorworks allows BaseQuantities to be added to IfcStair and its secondaries (IfcStairFlight, IfcSlab, IfcRailing) in the Data Manager Settings. When exporting a file with such a setting to Solibri via IFC, BaseQuantities Sets do appear for the decomposed secondary objects, not so for the primary object.<br/>
<br/>
I could not find out if this is buildingSMART standard or WAD for other reasons. If so, Vectorworks should not allow the user to add BaseQuantities Sets to Primary Objects in the first place instead of quietly not exporting them despite the custom setting. Also, the behavior should be the same for all objects. For Ramp CW for example, the BaseQuantities Set can be exported to the primary object. I specified it that way because it’s a low hanging fruit to map desirable quantities from the PIO record, thereby enriching the IFC file. I wasn’t aware it could break a rule.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
IFC 4:<br/>
<br/>
If BaseQuantities should strictly not be part of IFC4 (by buildingSMART standard or for another reason) because they were replaced by the object specific Qto_... Sets, the user should not be able to set them in the OIP or the data manager. But as long as they can be set, like now, they should also be exported according to these settings which is currently not the case.

 * No clear way to fill in the Type Name field within Solibri – different results for different IFC objects. IfcWallStandardCase is the only one which is able to differentiate between Name and Type /Type Name<br/>
 * IfcFurniture Type – no way to add to Type or Type Name field, Had to resort to BuildingElementProxy<br/>
 * Assigning IFC data to 3D OR 2D/3D symbols displays unpredictable behaviour. I have avoided where possible and combined multiple hardscapes into a solid addition to show as one IFC object. Or, turning symbols into groups to ensure they come through into Solibri leads to a much larger file size.<br/>
 * Classification only comes through once. Classification 2 or 3 do not come through.<br/>
 * For most objects, the class (vectorworks class) corresponds with the Layer field in Solibri/IFC.. This is unpredictable depending on the type of object – Symbols / groups the main culprit – assumably because the objects within the groups are on numerous classes? This should pick up the class of the group.

                IFC Export: Auto Hybrids get not completely exported

<br/>
Auto Hybrides in an export as IFC 2x3 aren&#39;t complete. In the attached example are the parts on top and bottom missing. So I think the missing parts / informations getting lost if the geometry is edit to an auto hybrid. Because if I exported the same geometry not as auto hybrid, this one is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Thank for testing.<br/>

6) add both to the BIM Wall Data Sheet<br/>
7) for the record format field source click Edit Field...<br/>
8) append something to the name and create a popup list with at least two items (for example item1 and item2).<br/>
9) confirm OK, OK, OK<br/>
10) create a wall and see that the default value from the data sheet popup shows up on the Data tab<br/>

When one (window data sheet settings) has nothing to do with the other (wall data sheet settings), there is no reason for them to interact the way they do. This can and does lead to quite some frustration with our customers.

The tool should remember whatever mode was used last even between sessions.<br/>

Is this the desired behaviour? <br/>
Interestingly, I am getting a ghosted radius selection if I move the mouse to a certain point. This will not appear again, if I move the PIO somewhere else in the drawing.<br/>

to test, place two lines of truss at 20&#39; high and about 20 feet apart.<br/>

The third click will align the lens to the location clicked. The third click will not activate the Braceworks red alignment line.<br/>
<br/>
When inserting the projector, it should be placed centered as it would be hung rather than at the lens. The project should also adjust to the height of the truss.

In the enclosed file and movie you can see that when choosing a particular Root Ball 3D shape there are some preset but customisable sizes in litres.<br/>
A litre is divided by 1000 to get the cubic metres. So 100 litres should be 10 cubic metres.<br/>
<br/>
When the root balls are measured and modelled using the Model&gt;Volumetric properties you can see that the Volumes do not reflect what should be the litre volume. So the Root Balls sizes are inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
The texture mapping of the Structural Member tool is different between 2020 and 2021 (I suspect it is a bug of 2021).<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1.Draw a beam-shaped figure with the Structural Member tool at angles of 0 and 90 degrees, respectively.<br/>
 (In addition, the pillar shape is also drawn)<br/>
<br/>
(The Timber Shape is easy to understand for the Rectangle_Timber)<br/>
<br/>
2.Assign texture (&quot;Wood Arctiex Pine 03 RT&quot; is easy to understand)<br/>
<br/>
3.In 2020, the texture is mapped along the direction of the material, but 2021 is mapped in a certain direction along the coordinate axes.<br/>
Due to the nature of the figure, the 2020 specification is desirable, and the 2021 specification is inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample2020.vwx&quot;,&quot;sample2021.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie12560.mov&quot;,&quot;image12560.png&quot;.<br/>

                DOM: Double esc blocks normal esc

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The issue is a kind of hard to explain, because it has to to with interactivity with the Software and can only be reproduced in specific situations.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend you first watch the attached movie.<br/>
How to reproduce:<br/>
 # Activate the double escape Feature to exit groups and other containers.<br/>
 # See the Situation (one of many examples) where you use the smart edge feature and make some smart edges<br/>
 # Start drawing a line and escape smart edge and line to draw a new line<br/>
 # Do it in a normal speed a user would try it (0.5 sec)<br/>
 # Vectorworks recognise the first escape as a normal escape and the second escape as a &quot;double&quot; when you do it fast enough. <br/>
 # After that Vectorworks has the opinion, that the smart edge and the line are already escaped and dont allow to escape further. So the only solution to get the line from the cursor is, that user change the tool (x) or draw the line.<br/>
<br/>
We often hear from user, that escape does not work reliable. Also my fellows and me have this experience but we never cared about the real behavior and just ignored it (or worked around with changing tool(x) or draw the object and delete). Users just get used to it. But the feeling that behaviour can produces doupts about reliability. Not clear how to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
What seems to technically happens:<br/>
1. The first esc is recognized as a normal escape (the funktion do not know, that the key would be twice at this moment )<br/>
2. If the second keystroke follows in a small amount of time the double-key feature is executed and not a second single-keystroke<br/>
3. It seems that Vectorworks registered two single keystrokes and is of opinion, the tool is already reseted and does nothing after pressing the esc key. think that is a bug.<br/>
<br/>
What maybe could be done in my opinion:<br/>
1. Lower the douple click intervall to 0.25 sec. This will not really hurt the double-key function(whish).<br/>
2. Allow esc again after a double esc was made (bugfix).

<br/>
It would be nice if there was an automatic popup after an update with the question. There&#39;s some new functionality in the workspaces. Do you want to add this functionality automatically to your workspaces? <br/>

If yes, then the local workspaces will be added with the new tools and commands. <br/>

<br/>
If you remove the link between the 2D representation of the handrail post symbol and the horizontal rail it would be possible to create more flexible handrail posts. In the attached file you can see, that one of the railings has flying horizontal rods, because of a different 2D representation.<br/>

-Create a new design layer<br/>
-In the new layer dialog, choose to import &quot;Layer A&quot; from the attached file with the &quot;Import Layer Objects&quot; option enabled<br/>

Note that the Screen objects get imported on the Screen plane even though Legacy 2D is disabled.<br/>

I didn&#39;t see anything in the task doc about this but I&#39;m guessing the objects should get projected onto the Layer plane or the active Working plane.

                T02121 - Design Layer Viewport Fails to Project Screen Objects When Legacy 2D is Disabled, Shows No Plan Fills

</td>

<br/>
Note that the DLVP currently doesn&#39;t show any fills in plan view, and there&#39;s no &quot;Project Screen Objects&quot; option in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
-Now export the file to VW 2021 and open there<br/>
<br/>
Note that the DLVP doesn&#39;t show fills there either, but if you enable the &quot;Project screen objects&quot; OIP option the fills then show.<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like the 2022 DLVP has somehow gotten into a state where it isn&#39;t projecting the screen objects, but also isn&#39;t showing the OIP option since Legacy 2D is disabled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried replicating the issue in a new file but haven&#39;t had any luck, so I&#39;m not sure what triggered the problem. <br/>
<br/>
This started off as a Project Sharing project, where the main VWXP file had a reference from a regular VWX file that contained site geometry. That&#39;s where we originally noticed the problem, so it&#39;s possible this has something to do with Project Sharing or referencing. I&#39;ve attached a .zip containing the PF, my WF, and the ref file. Both the PF and the ref file have had Legacy 2D disabled for the entire project.<br/>
<br/>
The PF was located on the PSS server at: engmacserver/Projects/QA 2022 Project/QA Project_Tiny House_Main.vwxp<br/>
<br/>
The referenced Site file was located on the server at: nemetschekfiles/FileTesting/Individual TestFiles - QA/Mike/2022 QA pod project sharing testing/QA Project_Tiny_House_Site_3.vwx

Only linear is available, not inverse.  With linear you need to provide a limiting bound distance this will not work the same as inverse did.  Maxon may fix this, not sure.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make &quot;Working Plane Views&quot; active using the button in the mode bar<br/>
-Rotate the plan in the lower-right pane as shown<br/>
-Now switch to a Front view <br/>
-Draw any 2D object on the Working Plane <br/>
<br/>
Note that the Working Plane is oriented incorrectly so the 2D object gets drawn on a 3D plane that&#39;s not normal to the user&#39;s viewpoint (it&#39;s easier to see this if you Extrude it).<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2020. This also happens in 2022.

<br/>
The way I can reproduce it here is by printing with the Microsoft xps Document Writer v4. <br/>
<br/>
You can reproduce it with the attached Vectorworks File. Is is created from scratch with an empty file.<br/>
<br/>
1. Open The file<br/>
2. Print the sheet layer on windows 10 with the microsoft Document writer xps<br/>
3. I guess some printer previews also would thow the issue. Or Non-PS-Printers of windows generally maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If I convert the rectangles I can see the issue not anymore. So I guess it has also something to do the way Vectorworks handle those rectangle by printing or exporting the pdf and not just a limitation of the printing system.<br/>
<br/>
This issue landing frequently in our support box. Also there is a big thread about this in our user-forum. It seems a small thread in the us- forum. Seems to be related to pulling small frames out of big drawings, which maybe is made more often by some type user groups.<br/>

This appears to violate a basic Vectorworks cross-product principle.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the Wall Style and click &quot;Wall Closure at Inserts&quot;<br/>
-With the default Left edge active, switch to the Wrapping pane<br/>
<br/>
Note that everything is grayed-out at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now switch back to the Profile pane<br/>
-Change the &quot;Edit Edge&quot; option, then change it back to Left<br/>
-Switch to the Wrapping pane again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the controls are un-grayed and available.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in 27.0.x.<br/>
<br/>
When I try this on Windows 10 I&#39;m seeing that the browser remains grayed-out even after changing the Edge (will investigate separately).

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the &quot;Wall Closure at Inserts&quot; dialog<br/>
-In the Wrapping tab, enable the &quot;Wrap&quot; option for any component<br/>
-Now try to choose an item from the &quot;Wrap To&quot; menu<br/>
<br/>
Note that the menu can&#39;t be expanded and no further information is given.<br/>
<br/>
If you edit the Wall&#39;s components and designate a Core component the problem will go away, but it doesn&#39;t seem like that should be necessary. Maybe the menu should be expandable and should show an error if the user tries to choose the &quot;Center of Core&quot; option?<br/>
<br/>
This also happens in 2022 SP2.

Unfortunately, the customer (Disney) is not able to send the file due to NDAs. Is this working as designed? If so, I can submit a VE for this as it is very cumbersome to edit each Wall in the document.

 You will see an &quot;exterior&quot; wall with two &quot;interior&quot; walls t-joined to it.<br/>

 Notice the components of the exterior wall are clipped at the t-joins.<br/>

 # Select all three walls and use Duplicate Array to create duplicates of the walls with the following (or similar) offsets.  Make sure to include a &quot;Z&quot; offset.<br/>
 The following settings are used in the video:<br/>
<br/>
 - Number of Duplicated: 6<br/>
 Cartesian Offset:<br/>
 - X: 0&quot;<br/>
 - Y: 6&#39;0&quot;<br/>

 # In a 3D view and turn off the &quot;Wall-Interior&quot; class.<br/>

<br/>
The problem can be corrected by changing any the wall&#39;s Height settings in the Object Info palette to update the wall&#39;s 3D data.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  I was also able to reproduce the issue by flooding these steps:<br/>
 # Select all three walls and Group them<br/>
 # In a &quot;Right&quot; 3D view, option drag a copy of the group so that the duplicate is offset from the original&#39;s Z location.<br/>
 # Use the &quot;Duplicate&quot; command to create additional duplicates.<br/>
 # Turn on the &quot;Wall-Interior&quot; class and you&#39;ll see the same issue.

In the file is a Section Viewport and a Viewport. In the Section Viewport we can see that keeps the hatch.<br/>
<br/>
In the Viewport happens the following:<br/>
- switch from Wireframe to Shaded, hatch is lost without updating. Colours are kept.<br/>
- switch back to Wireframe, colours are still kept.<br/>
- switch again to Shaded and Update. Colours are lost.<br/>
- switch to Hidden Line and Update. No Colours.<br/>
- switch to Dashed Hidden Line and Update. No Colours.<br/>
- switch to Sketch and Update. Colours are back.<br/>
- switch to Unshaded Polygon. Colours are lost.<br/>
- switch to Shaded Polygon. No Colours.<br/>
- switch to Shaded Polygon no Lines. Empty.<br/>
- switch to Wireframe. Colours are back.<br/>
The Walls Hatch was never retrieved.

If I Render all together (which customers wants to do &gt; Render it over night), it crashes my Vectorworks. I have 64 GB RAM and 270GB Free SSD Space. I think it crashes the Moment it starts swaping on my Harddisk. I do the same on my macintosh. It is very much slower but it seems not to crash. I did not completed If I add RAM Vectorworks and RAM Cineware together It uses about 80 GB RAM. <br/>

The Customers said he was able to Render Layouts like this in VW 2019 but I not have verified this yet. I think also Cloud Service would not update this layout, also not tried that.<br/>

I&#39;ve trimmed out all the extra contents in the file, so it should open to the viewport in question and only include the Design Layers. The files were also purged, and my apologies for the larger size.<br/>
<br/>
The users are referencing a 3D document and placing the Design Layer Viewports over top of the contents in their 2D files. I don&#39;t think this is the best workflow in this situation, but please let me know if this is just a limitation of their current workflow. It&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever seen done before, but we should be able to see the 3D geometry in the viewport.<br/>

The user in question is Ben Bauer (benjamnn@gmail.com).<br/>

Please let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to be of any further assistance with this! Have an awesome day! :)

In the enclosed file there are some keynotes. They have &#39;Auto Fit Bubble Width&#39; unchecked with a maximum width set to 5.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the single digit ones are left aligned. Users want to centre them in the bubble. Yet no alignment options whether from within the OIP or from the text menu seem to have any effect on the text once the &#39;Auto Fit Bubble Width&#39; is unchecked.<br/>
<br/>
The workaround is to select all (if need be) and in the Keynote Prefix field in the OIP click the space bar and enter. That will work for the single digit ones at least.<br/>

In the enclosed file there is a wall using a Wall Style called &#39;Stud Ext 90&#39;. It has a solid fill and the wall is in the class &#39;Walls Ext ex&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
The textures come from the class and the one facing the viewer if the left hand side. The class has a solid fill &#39;Use at Creation&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Yet when the identical viewports are rendered using Renderworks, OpenGL and Hidden Line, only the OpenGL shows it as solid.<br/>
<br/>
The file was created in 2021 but the template originated in v2012. I used a layer import into a virgin 2021 file but that hasn&#39;t made any difference. You&#39;ll also see that if you return to the layer &#39;Ground Ex&#39; that the geometry lives on it will render correctly in Renderworks.<br/>

Doing anything in this dialogue like adding speakers to the array, changing angles, clicking into any field or changing anything takes up to 30 -40 seconds for something to happen. It is impossible to work.<br/>

In the enclosed file there is a Speaker Array using symbols. In the OIP click &#39;Configure Array&#39; and go to the Array tab. The preview is in wireframe and one can work immediately anywhere in the dialogue. Change the preview to Hidden Line and you will see that doing any work is near impossible due to the extended delay in navigating or processing.<br/>

                Hidden Line Render- inconsistency not showing intersections when Smoothing Angle is 0º for certain Plug in Objects from the Detailing toolset

In the enclosed file and movie you will see that there are a load of &#39;Channels, I Beams, Wide Flanges etc from the Detailing toolset.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when rendered in HL and the Smoothing Angle is at 0 degrees there are no intersections shown. This is not what is expected. In the movie I ungroup one object to get  it to an extrude, then use the Push Pull to change it from the Extrude to a Solid.<br/>
<br/>
The Smoothing Angle now has effect and it will need to go to 10º in order to see no intersections, which is what the PIOs show when at 0. <br/>
<br/>
In other words the PIOs are not affected by the Smoothing Angle in a HLR. It&#39;s probably always been like this but it is inconsistent.<br/>

We have recently had two users, one on the macOS v2020 and the other a Windows user on v2021 with this problem. It seems to happen very occasionally with people as noted on the forum.<br/>
The problem is that the Renderworks menu is greyed out and if you try and create a new resource from the Resource Manager nothing about Renderworks is listed (see enc screenshot and note no textures render in OpenGL).<br/>
<br/>
We make 3 suggestions and to try after each one to see if it comes back.<br/>
1. Run the repair from the Vectorworks Updater.<br/>
2. Delete the Maxon folder in their Preferences and also the Renderworks folder from the Vectorworks user folder.<br/>
3. Uninstall and then reinstall.<br/>

                Spotlight: Undesired re-orientation when placing lighting devices on rigging objects
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
This stems from this forum post:<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/90102-when-i-place-a-light-on-a-hanging-position-why-is-vw-automatically-rotating-the-light/<br/>
<br/>
You can see from my enclosed movies that when placing a lighting device that is +/-90º to the rigging object means that it forcibly re-orientates to be 0º to be perpendicular to the rigging object in my example.<br/>
<br/>
Also when placing a lighting device using the insert instrument tool and rotating the device with the tool, if it is moved along the rigging object a few times, eventually it re-orientates to 0º to be perpendicular to the rigging object. In the first movie that I posted to the forum it happened after 4 moves, the second movie after 5.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is that the lighting device should not change rotation unless actively done so by the user.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a bug regarding the new Spotlight Preference as you can see in the first movie when a device is placed on an angled rigging object and rotated by the instrument insertion tool. The device then ignores the new preference &#39;Orient loads with rigging objects when placing in 3D&#39;. <br/>

In the enclosed file there is a simple model and Renderworks camera. If the camera is activated, then deactivated, then unselected, note that as you move the mouse there is a black &#39;dot&#39; that mirrors the mouse as well as a line from dead centre of the horizon. This also mirrors the mouse direction side to side.<br/>

I have looked in the Help and can not find anything about this. These artefacts are only seen provided the view haas been set from the Renderworks Camera. Any other perspective view it doesn&#39;t show.<br/>

In the enclosed movie and file you can see that I am selecting a polygon and using the &#39;Create Objects from Shape&#39; command to make a Seating Section.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s shame that no preview can be generated, but as you can see I enter an angle of 46º before exiting the dialogue. Once the Seating Section is placed on the page this angle mis 0º in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
If I then enter an angle in the OIP of 46º the result is wrong in the Seating Section. I then undo and use the Focus Angle widget and move that into roughly the correct angle and it gets close say 52º. I can then type in 46º and the seats angle correctly.<br/>

In the enclosed file there are two polygons. One has a Tile fill the other an Image fill of the same type of wood.<br/>
Both have been locally mapped, and rotated and resized. When File&gt;Export PDF note that the Tile fill does not export correctly as the angle is wrong. The user has to replaced all Tiles with images or export to v2021 so it is a regression.<br/>

On sheet 1.01 there is a series of design layers with one that has a PDF. The PDF is a layer plane object.<br/>
The PDF is at the bottom of the layer stack and hasn&#39;t been over ridden in the viewport. If the viewport is rendered in Hidden Line render (HLR) then the stage disappears. If you uncheck &#39;Project Screen Objects&#39; you can now see the stage and although the viewport is now dirty you can export to PDF.<br/>
Sometimes it would display ok but when exported to PDF, none of the stage would be exported so it was just the base PDF. Sometimes when changing display settings when it&#39;s invisible I can occasionally see the objects in wireframe as if it&#39;s a VGM issue.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022 once rendered in HLR the stage is not visible at all. If rendered in Shaded mode then the PDF appears. It&#39;s as if there&#39;s an issue between HLR and the PDF in 2022. <br/>
<br/>
I have checked the file (origin etc) and all seems ok.<br/>

Prior to v2021, if a viewport was grouped, users could interactively rescale the viewport with the Selection tool. In the movie you can see me do this easily in v2020 and then see me unable to do this in v2021. I suggest this is a regression.<br/>
<br/>
This ability is very useful with perspective renders and doing a presentation layout on the page for one or multiple viewports. Instead of laboriously changing the scale numbers in the OIP you can just use the mouse. Users have been able to do this for many versions.<br/>
<br/>
Someone just said to me &quot;even Turbocad can do this&quot; and I was about to rebut them but checked and indeed we can no longer do this, hence this report.<br/>

It is only 21.5MB.<br/>
I have restarted the machine, from the enclosed movie you can see I can log out and back in but there&#39;s no escape it is stuck &#39;uploading&#39;. I would like it to stop so I can try again to upload the file to the assets and drag the pin onto the page.<br/>

In the enclosed file, there is a simple line and circle. If you Model&gt;Extrude along Path and choose the line (or the circle) as the path then it will fail.<br/>
<br/>
If you draw similar objects of a similar size it will work. <br/>
If you trace the original objects and run the command it will work.<br/>
If you rotate the circle  90º (ie flip it up so it stands vertically not horizontally) it will work.<br/>
<br/>
So it is bizarre that this doesn&#39;t.<br/>

On this page about the Model&gt;Surface Array:<br/>
<br/>
https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2021/eng/index.htm#t=VW2021_Guide%2FShapes3%2FCreating_a_surface_array.htm%23CSH_12<br/>
<br/>
Under Array Items it lists: &quot;Symbol instance&quot; as being one.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this report is that *3D only* symbols are able to be used as array items. If a hybrid symbol is chosen, then it will generate an error message with no detail leaving the user non plussed as it plainly states &quot;Symbol instance&quot;. What needs clarifying is that it must be a &quot;3D only Symbol instance&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This held me back quite a while until I experimented and discovered the reason why it failed. As the majority of symbols in Vectorworks are hybrid this will frustrate many users.<br/>

PS Unless it&#39;s a bug that hybrid symbols can&#39;t be Array items?! I didn&#39;t check SP4.<br/>

If OpenGL and HLR are combined or just OpenGL the 3D is seen as expected. This bug is only when HLR only. Weirdly it is only the vertical instruments that do this.<br/>

The enclosed file has an imported .pts file. When getting the view correct on the design layer, and then View&gt;Create viewport I did not get the image in the viewport as it was from the design layer. At the end of the enc movie you will see what it looked like when the viewport is in wireframe when created directly from the design layer as is.<br/>
<br/>
I had to draw a rectangle (not easy in perspective over a point cloud!) and use that as a crop to produce the viewport as I thought it didn&#39;t work at all.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when rendered in shaded to see the Renderworks background the point cloud is all white and not how it looks on the design layer. So two things here as better explained in the movie.<br/>

I posted this question to the internal Slack channel &#39;vectorworks-usage&#39; on 22nd October 21:<br/>
<br/>
Is it WAD, a VB or should I do a VE that Line Types do not negotiate some curves very well? This Line Type is for a batter slope but was unusable in practice.<br/>
Cheers Peter<br/>
Screenshot &amp; file enc.<br/>
<br/>
Hugues said:<br/>
&quot;It does not look like WAD. There are challenging cases that are difficult to get right. File a bug.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I enclose the file and screenshot and a PDF from a Landmark user (sorry I don&#39;t have the Vectorworks file) who couldn&#39;t get the line type to work on some parts for the &quot;batter slope&quot;. She had to create different line types and even then still failed in how she assumed and wanted the line type to work.<br/>
<br/>
Line Types should always be able to draw on the pen unlike currently how it is unable to on the parts of the curves and arcs you can see in my file and screenshot. It would be great for a line type to be able to somehow work out and follow the pen exactly. Currently it is limited and more often than not in with polylines and certain curves unable to be used.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

<br/>
In the left instance (as seen in the isometric view)/bottom instance in plan view, the window has wall closure turned off, and the &quot;stucco/air gap&quot; component has an offset of 6&#39;11&quot;above the wall bottom, hence *below* the window insertion. All behave as expected.<br/>
<br/>
The second instance from left in isometric view /second from bottom in plan only differs from the first in that the &quot;stucco/air gap&quot; component has an offset of 7&#39;0&quot; above the wall bottom, hence *above* the window insertion. All components except for the stone disappear in 3D views but are visible in top/plan.<br/>
<br/>
The third instance from left in isometric view /third from bottom in plan only differs from the second in that in the &quot;Plug-in Object Options&quot;, &quot;Use wall closure&quot;  has been selected and and wall closure profiles have been applied. All components except for the stone disappear in 3D views *and* in top/plan.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth instance only differs from the third in that all wall components have heights equal to the wall height, except the stone component bottom is registered to the layer&#39;s &quot;ledge&quot; layerless level (even the base component is full wall height). Wall closure is used, and it behaves as expected in 3D and top/plan view.<br/>
<br/>
The upshot is that wall closure does not play nicely with wall components of various heights.

<br/>
 <br/>
 # Open attached MVR (same results in ESC files as seen in video)<br/>
 # Select ALL ETC Source4 05deg Lighting Device (in design space)<br/>
 # Using the Up Arrow Key, test that the Lighting Devices move in the same direction<br/>
 # With the Lighting Devices still selected, Right Click to use &quot;Focus Selected Lights Here&quot; somewhere on the stage<br/>
 # Once again, Use the Up Arrow Key to move the Lighting Devices<br/>
 # Notice how they no longer move in the same direction (now opposite directions)<br/>
 # Steps 4 &amp; 5 can be repeated to show that each time this function is used different lights respond in opposite directions<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the video, I only used the UP Arrow to keep things simple and consistent.  You can see in the start of the video each Lighting Device was reacting the same to the use of the UP Arrow.  After the use of &quot;Focus Selected Lights Here&quot;, the Lighting Devices react in opposite directions to the Up Arrow. Use &quot;Focus Selected Lights Here&quot; again and different lights are moving in opposite directions.  It seems like there is a random element that occurs each time that function is used.<br/>
<br/>
(I haven&#39;t tested on MacOS _yet_, but my guess is it is the same even though I didn&#39;t mark the bug as such)

<br/>
The attached VWX file has a simple box extrude with the texture tool used to apply texture on one or more faces.  The attached MVR and ESC files are from this file.<br/>
<br/>
In the ESC file:  The screen shots maybe not look like it, but the texture files are attached to 2 out the 3 face for the large cube.  The small cube has an additional face with the single face texture.  All the textures are really off in scale and stretched - like switched from Surface US Mapping Type to Plane.<br/>
<br/>
In the MVR file:  The cube with 3 textured faces lost all textures.  The smaller cube with 1 textured face has similar results to the ESC file.

[~gmiller], [~stevej] I apologize for officially filing this so late, but I had the impression changes were in store for this, so I was waiting for a new version.<br/>
<br/>
We need the ability to adjust the location of the snapping buttons. I received an eye injury at birth that causes me considerable eye strain when looking down and to the right. Toggling snaps is critical to my workflow, so I also need to frequently glance at this information. <br/>
<br/>
With the snapping toggles in their current location, using Vectorworks causes me physical discomfort, especially on an external monitor positioned according to ergonomic standards. This makes 2022 unusable for production work for me. Please look into providing positional options for SP0 – this is more than a personal preference, but represents an accessibility issue that could provide a barrier for some users.

<br/>
I don&#39;t use this this feature much, so maybe this is WAD.  However, the Renderworks styles are somewhat new, so I wanted to pass this along. (Vectorworks 2021 &amp; 2022 look the same in this regard).  I worked with the &#39;Set Spotlight Rendering Options&#39;, but I wasn&#39;t able to fix the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I provided the Vectorworks file used, the video generated, and screen shots to get a quick idea of what the difference is between what is seen in Vectorworks and what is seen in the animated video.

The attached screenshot displays a rendered version of this viewport, which was done with VW 2021, so this is a regression.<br/>
<br/>
The same situation exists with sheet number 1. As you can see when you switch to that sheet in VW 2022, it already appears as up-to-date, which was done in VW 2021 (by the user). I tried updating it on my machine, and it didn&#39;t crash as soon as VW 2022 does, so I assumed it would finish. When you try to re-render this sheet with VW 2022, Vectorworks crashes shortly afterwards.

Is this a bug? Or is it WAD? Is it because the cloud has somehow a different renderer?<br/>

                KLS: Create Stage very slow with many Renderworks textures
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In our german Vectorworks the creation of a stage using at least one texture is very slow when there are many textures in Renderworks - Texures folder.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce (do it on Mac), rename libraries/Defaults/Event Planning/Stage to libraries/Defaults/Event Planning/Bühne and the file in that folder rename to Bühnen - Texturen.vwx.<br/>
Of course rename in Vectorworks.vwr/Strings/210 Folder.vwstring #3 from Stage to Bühne in order Vectorworks can use this renamed default.<br/>
<br/>
Download Entourage and Miscellaneous libraries and Renderworks Libraries with Vectorworks Package Manager. We need tons of textures.<br/>
Delete file Flooring Carpet.vwx inside Renderworks - Textures folder.<br/>
Very important: In order to see the effect, the texture we select in stage command does only have to exist inside event planning defaults and not inside Renderworks - Textures folder.<br/>
<br/>
Start Vectorworks and refresh libraries.<br/>
Draw a rectangle of maybe 5 x 5 Meters.<br/>
Invoke Create Stage command.<br/>
Set Structure = Legs-Basic and click 3D Options button.<br/>
Set Top Color to Custom Texture and select Carpet Low Pile 01 Blue RT.<br/>
Again because important: Select a texture which is only inside the event planning defaults and not inside Renderworks - Textures folder.<br/>
<br/>
Click OK and start creation of stage decks. Please notice it is slow.<br/>
Imagine how slow it will get, when creating for example 150 stage decks.<br/>
<br/>
I did some additional testing.<br/>
This only happens, when there is a german umalut (ä,ö,ü,ß) inside the event planning default folder. In this case it is an &quot;ü&quot; inside Bühne.<br/>
Notice, you can select a texture from that &quot;Bühne-folder&quot;, so Vectorworks recognizes and accepts the pathname with a german umlaut.<br/>
But when the command tries to create the stage decks, then the path that &quot;Bühne-folder&quot; does not seem to be recognized and Vectorworks looks inside the Renderworks - Textures folder in order to find the texture, which of course - because we deleted Flooring Carpet.vwx before - is not there.<br/>
<br/>
Mac and Win do have a different handling of special characters and so the german umlaute. Mac seems to use two characters to create e.g. an &quot;ü&quot; - first an u and then the two point supercripted. When I change the Mac created umlaut to a Win created umalut for testing, then it works too, because Vectorworks seems to find the path then.<br/>
Because Mac has its own way of handling special characters this is not a real solution.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, there is a function inside the spotlight tools like stage deck which creates the path to the defaults. It seems, that special characters like german umlaute are not supported. If so, there may be more places, where this occurs.<br/>

<br/>
In the attached .VWX-file we have a 3D-Symbol of a Chair, inside of this 3D-Symbol we have various other 3D-Symbols which are parts of the Chair (seat, legs, back, etc.). Inside of this 3D-Symbols we have a Mesh of 3D polygon in each.<br/>
<br/>
In the video we can see that the top part of the chair (main 3D-Symbol) is not displayed when Renderworks is active, while the bottom part / legs are displayed.<br/>
<br/>
If we zoom in and out, we can see the top part (seat) of the chair being briefly displayed and then disappears again when the zooming ends and the re-rendering is finished.<br/>
<br/>
If we go inside of the main 3D-Symbol, then also inside of one the next layer of 3D-Symbols (eg. seat back) and finally inside of the Mesh where the 3D Polygons are and activate Renderworks, in there the 3D Polygons are displayed.

If the base structure is set to none the problem goes away for all the screens in the file<br/>

<br/>
I have two lighting pipes which I name Pipe 1 and Pipe 2. I attach lights to Pipe 2, they pick up the position name as expected. I then convert both pipes to a Hanging Position, it suggests to me the name the pipe is already using, all good. <br/>
<br/>
If I now add lights to Pipe 1, they associate, with the rigging object and pick up the position name, still good. The problem is the lights that were already on Pipe 2. They are still clearly associated with the position because you can see the blue arrows. But they have LOST their position name. And annoyingly, the pipe has now been drawn over lights. <br/>
<br/>
If this is WAD, it shouldn&#39;t be. Whether you add lights before or after converting to a Hanging Position, they should continue to keep, or pick up, the position name of the Hanging Position.

The example used is the Section Viewport 4/4.3 and Design Layer EG, this happens when trying to open the Edit of other Design Layers and with other Section Viewports. I decided to use this one as an example.<br/>
<br/>
Like it is shown in the video, select the Section Viewport 4/4.3 and open the Edit of the Design Layer EG.<br/>
<br/>
Edit window takes 50 seconds to open with SP3 584826. After the Edit mode is open, it will take more 2 minutes and 8 seconds of rendering until we can work in this mode. This is a total of 2 minutes and 58 seconds until we can work on this mode.<br/>
<br/>
As we can see in the video the RAM used goes up to a little above 11 GB, it stagnated at precisely 11,34 GB right after I stopped the recording. This number didn&#39;t went down.

From my understanding, these should not be working as such.  I exported the file to Vectorworks 2021 and it works that same in Vectorworks 2021 SP4 &amp; SP3.<br/>

Just a note: While testing, I noticed that checking &#39;_Display extents beyond cut plane_&#39; (Under *Extents beyond Cut Plane* section in the OIP) causes the viewport to behaves the way I would expect, of course visually wrong results.  Just in case that is helpful information.<br/>

I did try re-importing from the VW stock library a new instance of the FD 34 4 m sections and after using the Replace Truss command there was two 4m choices available one had this issue the other did not, the first one was the default hybrid symbol and rendered correctly, the second which had the visibility issue was an instance in the file that had been rotated at some point.

Creating a section viewport in the attached file using clip cube crashes the file. Memory usage goes up to a point where machine just crashes with Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On a Mac on my side its a little bit better as it just starts to use 70gb memory on Vectorworks 2021 but i still can force quit it. I cant even take screenshots off the users windows machine as the machine completely crashes and the only way to get it back up usually is a force shut down and a complete reboot of the machine. <br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Whenever you have a jogged section viewport, the &quot;Extents Beyond Cut Plane&quot; is presumably based on the distance from the first segment of the Section Line, as indicated by the dashed line widget and blue control handle when reshaping the Section Line - this widget matches the distance in the &quot;Advanced Section Properties&quot; dialog box. In the screen recording this distance is 10&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the actual Section Viewport, the extents seem to be drawn from the second segment of the Section Line, rather than the first. Furthermore, when using both a foreground render (Hidden Line) and background render (OpenGL), the two modes are drawn with mismatching extents, neither of which are the expected measurement of 10&#39; from the first segment of the Section Line. It&#39;s very confusing and makes it impossible to draw jogged sections properly.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*OBJECT DISPLAY BUTTON*<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, only objects that are directly before/above the Cutting line and *not* *obscured* by anything else will be revealed using the visibility settings of this button. This is not necessarily the case and all objects are revealed when using the hidden line setting (not what I would expect) and hidden using the Hidden Line setting (what I would expect.)<br/>
<br/>
*HIDDEN OBJECT DISPLAY BUTTON*<br/>
<br/>
I understand that objects that are *obscured* by other objects are controlled by the parameters of this function.<br/>
Using a Hidden Line setting all obscured objects are revealed as you would expect but sweeps seem to only render in dashed hidden line.<br/>
<br/>
Using Dashed Hidden Line Rendering option also reveals the items, but only in Hidden Line. To achieve a dashed hidden line rendering I need to have Dashed Hidden Line enabled in the OBJECT DISPLAY settings.<br/>
<br/>
There is also variable behavior when an object is contained within a symbol.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea whether I am misunderstanding the functionality of these before/above cut plane settings as there is virtually nothing written about this in the help files, so forgive me if I have got all this wrong.<br/>

Enclosed is a file and also a video explaining the file a bit!<br/>

Then you create a Section Viewport that looks at just the door, perhaps for an enlarged elevation or something, so you set the Length Range to &quot;Limited by Section Length.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the resulting viewport, there are vertical wall lines drawn at the left and right extents of the viewport. This is very bad, as it indicates there is geometry there which doesn&#39;t actually exist (like the edge of the wall, or a corner or something). See attached example file. It makes the door look like it&#39;s in a separate wall (or in my case Hollywood flat). As a workaround I&#39;d add a viewport crop but this is not an ideal solution in certain scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
The Section Viewport should not add these vertical lines in the first place. If a user desired the lines they could always drawn them in Annotations. But otherwise those extra lines can only lead to problems.

Then I tried copying the viewport and that seemed to work. You can see on this sheet that all eight viewports have the exact same render properties, section properties, and class visibilities and overrides, but two viewports don&#39;t show the site mesh lines while the other six do. Each of the lower right viewports in the set is the copy of the original in the upper left.

-Modify&gt; Convert&gt; Convert Copy to Polygons<br/>

-Notice you get the &quot;Spinning beach ball&quot; indefinitely and the memory goes up to 15 GB or so, which is higher than the memory usage in VW2021 SP3 with the same above steps.<br/>

Note that performing the menu command &#39;Convert copy to Lines&quot; works as expected and the above steps don&#39;t cause VW2021 Sp3 to hang, so this appears to be a regression. <br/>

Also, this type of test is something I do every version of Vectorworks and its a good gauge that gives me an indication on the performance. <br/>

This happens in SP0, SP1, and SP2.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Render in Hidden Line<br/>
-Now open the Line Render Options and enable the &quot;Display Surface Hatches&quot; option<br/>
-Do a few zoom and flyover operations<br/>
<br/>
Note that, in certain views, the surface hatches will fail to show.<br/>
<br/>
If I try this in 2022 SP0 and SP1 the hatches seem to fail much more often. In SP2 the failure is more sporadic but still happens (the attached video shows SP2).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem in sheet layer viewports.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2021.

<br/>
We have a file from a user that is relatively small and simple. However the section viewports he has created cant be updated as the file hangs and Vectorworks is unresponsive. <br/>
<br/>
We can replicate this also, we cant get these to update within Vectorworks hanging. <br/>
<br/>
The sheet layer is called, 006 Proposed Elevations B<br/>
<br/>
Please find the file attached, the user needs to use this file and he has also tried starting the model again however this has happened again. <br/>
<br/>
I also attach a recording of my memory usage when trying to update the viewport. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas would be great as we have hit a dead end. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need any logs etc from me. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>

<br/>
Objects under a cut pane aren&#39;t visible, when the selection line cut a shell solid. The Problem is, so I think, that the cutting sections is also visible in the section viewport. It happens in a horizontal section viewport or when a viewport is in use to crate horizontal viewports with the section viewport. <br/>
<br/>
I attached my test file.<br/>

This only seems to happen in 2021; the user is able to work around this by using a Section Viewport or by using VW 2022.  I don&#39;t expect there to be any fixes aside from the workarounds here but was requested to report this in case there are any potential fixes or reasons for this rendering behavior.<br/>

It was brought to my attention that line styles, for example lines including text like gas, hot water, etc, when shown in an axonometric viewport, rendered with a hidden line style, the &quot;gas&quot; text looks not presentable.  I wonder if Line type and axonometric viewports do not get along.  I am including a screenshot and a small sample file. I&#39;d recommend looking at the single layer and then look at the viewport on the single sheet. The graphic quality seems to be not acceptable. text is rotated and some hair lines appear in random places.

When changing the class in the OIP, both the source and extrude are forced into the same class.<br/>

This issue evokes multiple bugs in section viewports and overruling class attributes in viewports. That&#39;s why we consider this to be a High Priority.

<br/>
Not sure if this should be a bug or enhancement request. <br/>
<br/>
When in a rotate plan you can&#39;t scale objects within a group, they seem to just move apart instead of scaling properly. This is only when in rotate plan. <br/>
<br/>
Please see video for example. <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks <br/>

<br/>
When Line Weight Scale in Advanced Properties is set to 0.1 it seems to get around this.  It also appears correctly on Windows rather than on Mac (but the exports will be the same either way).  It also looks like nudging the doors and windows will fix it, but that&#39;s not the best workaround.<br/>

 # Insert a Lighting Devices that comes with a C Clamp (ex. any ETC Source 4)<br/>
 # Attach a Lighting Accessory to the Lighting Device<br/>
 # Remove the Lighting Accessory Tool in Remove Mode (best seen in ISO view)<br/>
 # Notice the C Clamp was removed first<br/>

There is simple work around by using the Edit Accessory in the OIP, so not critical.<br/>

I tried updating the same viewport with VW 2021 (see the attached scereenshot) and when I checked the status 10 hours into the rendering, Cinerender did not exist as a process. So, this is not a regression, meaning that 2021 also can&#39;t handle this viewport update, but 2022 behaves differently - it completely crashes. <br/>
The attached crash dump is from when this file crashed on the cloud from one of the user&#39;s attempts to generate a PDF.

As I understand, the current logic is that upper/lower wall hole edges that have an angle less than 45º from the ground plane should be considered as Top/Bottom and use closure settings from those edges.<br/>
<br/>
Notice the wall holes in the red walls all have edges less than 45º but are using Left or Right edge settings.

When the exterior/interior profile type is changed to &quot;Round&quot;, the wall components don&#39;t look as expected. I narrowed this down to a corner window and a regular window within the wall.<br/>

When the regular window doesn&#39;t exist in the wall, the result is slightly different when the &#39;Splay&#39; profile is enabled.

Open test file. Note the closure doesn&#39;t look correct in Top/Plan, but its is very subtle. When switching to 3D view, you can see the gaps at the side and bottom of the corner windows.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also note there is a splay wrapping on the horizontal wall; however; the wrapping doesn&#39;t show in the &#39;horizontal&#39; corner windows. This seems like a specific issue with the corner window?

I used a window set to an opening. At first it worked, but when I set component offsets in the window, the profiles didn&#39;t look correct in 2D. If I didn&#39;t set component offset, the window showed header lines that lines didn&#39;t extend to the edge of the wall because the components were wrapped. I tried turning off classes in order to remove the lines, and suddenly a wall appeared in the opening. (It took me a while to figure this out, because it looked like the window wasn&#39;t cutting the wall in 2D or 3D.) I haven&#39;t been able to repeat the spontaneous wall creation but I have attached files with the wall there and after the wall was removed.

In the test file, with a round profile and a radius of 4&quot; or less, the wall closure looks OK. However, if you increase the radius value, the 2D representation doesn&#39;t look right. I know most people will not put a large radius value, but perhaps we have to restrict large values?<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-In the Render tab of the OIP, highlight the &quot;Siding&quot; component and change its Offset H so that it aligns with the lower wall&#39;s texture (a 13.4&quot; value aligns them cleanly)<br/>
-Now select the in-wall Window and change its height<br/>
<br/>
Note that the texture is no longer aligned.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this problem in 2021 so it looks like a regression.<br/>

When editing the seating section by double clicking on the section, the boundary will be adjust properly. But, if you are hitting the settings menu afterwards, and clicking ok, the seating section moves a bit. <br/>
<br/>
I assume that it has something to do with the adjustment of the seating boundary.<br/>

                Non-screen plane planar objects in SLVP annotations
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is an issue that&#39;s bothered me since the debut of VW2021 but for whatever reason I&#39;ve never filed a bug about. Another user made this post recently which inspired me to finally file this: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/83292-annotations-jump-around-on-viewport-annotation-layer/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Often we paste 2D objects from a Design Layer into viewport annotations (like ALL the time). What&#39;s happening in 2021 is that 2D objects that are set to Layer Plane upon copying (and likely other non-Screen planes) sometimes behave erratically when pasted into the annotations of a sheet layer viewport. And because you&#39;re working on a Sheet Layer, the OIP does not display the &quot;Plane&quot; dropdown, so it&#39;s impossible to see that the 2D object is still somehow remembering its plane. Furthermore, it&#39;s impossible to fix it in place without the Plane dropdown.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some of the sporadic issues include:<br/>
<br/>
-The object only appearing while zooming and panning, but otherwise being invisible.<br/>
<br/>
-Text objects appearing as grey boxes instead of the actual text.<br/>
<br/>
-The object not moving when the viewport is moved.<br/>
<br/>
-The object moving way off to the side when the viewport is moved.<br/>
<br/>
-The object flipping itself or rotating itself.<br/>
<br/>
-Other graphic glitchiness.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen with every single Layer Plane pasted object, but it&#39;s happened enough times over the past year I can confirm this is the cause. I deal with it several times per week. At the moment I don&#39;t have a file to attach, but next time I encounter the issue I&#39;ll try to remember to attach it here before fixing it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently the workaround is to cut the offending objects, paste onto a Design Layer or blank document, change their plane to Screen, then return to the viewport and paste again. However, I doubt most users are able to ascertain what causes the issue in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What SHOULD happen: all 2D objects pasted into SL annotations need to behave as Screen Plane objects do. This is what used to happen prior to 2021 - there was never any worry about what plane an object was on before pasting into annotations.

Using the exact same symbol, but having no record attached, the problem was solved. See the attached video and file. The reference symbols in the two different LL are exactly the same except one has an attached record and one does not.

<br/>
If I take a light that was in a drawing at 1/2&quot; scale, and paste that light into a new file at 1/4&quot; scale, all the labels seem to display correctly except my unit numbers. In the Text Style, the font should be 14pt. You&#39;ll notice when I first look at the LL the place holder &quot;Unit Number&quot; is in two different sizes that changes in the middle of the word, which is very strange. When I select that piece of text, the size is missing, even though it should be getting pulled from the text style. By reapplying the text style, the size does say 14, but visually it remains doubled in size as compared to the rest of the labels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like all the other label items are reducing their size by 50%, as I assume they are supposed to, when placed in a 1/4&quot; drawing...but the unit number is not. Either I&#39;m doing something wrong, or there is a bug, but something is amiss. As, I believe, all my text styles and LL items are built the same, I&#39;m confused why the Unit Number is behaving any differently.

Take Seating Section, choose &quot;Rectangle Mode&quot;, make your 1. click, after that try to define the size of the planned rectangle (border for the seating layout). There ist no ∆x and ∆y to define the size, same with the Oval Tool. Using the Poly Mode you can define every single line.<br/>
After you have defined the rectangle there is no chance to define the orientation properly. For instance you can not define the wanted angle, using pressed effects nothing. We have this behavior in 2021 and in 2022 beta 3.<br/>

                Wrong WallAreaNet calculation in Vectorworks 2021 and 2022
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Thanks a lot for the discussion about the „WallAreaNet“ issue and your effort to help us. We know that the numbers were wrong already for a pretty long time. The reason why we get more and more complains is just because of the fact that more and more people have to do BIM and have to deliver these kind of numbers.<br/>
 <br/>
In our opinion we can split that up in three issues:<br/>
 <br/>
1. We get wrong WallAreaNet in 2021<br/>
2. The WallAreaNet has changed in 2022 (better result but do not match the formula description)<br/>
3. More function/options for 2023<br/>
 <br/>
This report is actually only to address issue 1. Issue 2 is probably another bug but gives currently the better result in 2022. But I think it is wrong anyhow :).<br/>
 <br/>
To reproduce and understand the issue please:<br/>
 <br/>
1. Watch the attached movie first<br/>
 <br/>
Issue 1 (would be nice to address this in 2021):<br/>
We would like to get the right result for 2021 but honestly, most of our customers are interested in getting the Net/Gross area of the left and right far of the wall/component. But as I mentioned it would be fantastic if you find an easy way to address this in 2021.<br/>
 <br/>
a.) Open „Testfile 2021“ in Vectorworks 2022<br/>
The WallAreaNet should be calculated along the center line. Well, this is actually what this specific formula should do. In that case, the area should be (9.2*4)-4 = 32.8. You do not get a detailed information how the WallNetArea along the center line should be calculated. To keep it simple we think that it just should be the area of the section surface along the center line. Which is (9.2*4)-4 = 32.8. So it depends on the opening size that is on the plane of the section along the center line. <br/>
 <br/>
However, we definitely need better numbers that are part of issue 3.<br/>
 <br/>
Issue 2 (these are changes in 2022. Get better results but anyhow wrong)<br/>
As shown in the movie the WallAreaNet calculation is completely different. After file conversion from 2021 to 2022 you get a WallAreaNet value which is the left side of the wall. NOT based on the CENTERLINE anymore. This is actually the better number for the customer but wrong for the formula. In addition „WallAreaGross“ in 2022 is still based on the Centerline. Very confusing. I think this is a bug and should be fixed to as soon as we get some better function options in 2023 :)<br/>
 <br/>
Issue 3 (planed for Vectorworks 2023)<br/>
We realized that the description of the function/options in Vlados Excel Spreadsheet are good but not 100% clear in any case. We try to create some sketches that help you to understand the function/options we would like to see in 2023.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We hope that Issue 1 can be addressed in an SP for 2021 because some users will finish their projects with that version. I’m not sure if you should fix Issue 2 :). Because currently it gives the better number for the customers. But it is very confusing too because WallAreaGross is calculated differently (along CenterLine). Well, I think you should fix that to avoid confusion and the customer has to use some Object variables to get the numbers of Left/Right edge of the Wall.<br/>
 <br/>
We know that you expected to get a better description how the &quot;WallAreaNet&quot; should be calculated. But because of the fact the formula is calculating areas along the center line it probable can be kept simple and just give the section area along the center line. However, the plan is to provide sketches for the function/options for 2023 that also contain information how are things calculated if you have a more complex closer profile.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
PS: I&#39;m wondering if the new function/options are also calculated depending of object texture or if it is really based on the &quot;real&quot; geometry.

<br/>
Exploding a hybrid symbol whose elevation is &lt;&gt; 0 on design layer, turns unexpectedly the screen objects into 3D objects.<br/>
<br/>
This is highly undesirable. If they were screen plane, they have no reason to turn into 3D and it does no good to us, ever, to have them shoot themselves at 0, 0. And we don&#39;t want 3D objects floating around.<br/>
<br/>
Please<br/>
 * select the symbol on drawing and convert to group using cmd + K (this sym instance has elevation &lt;&gt; 0)<br/>
 * Ungroup until you reach the 2D objects: they are 3D plane<br/>
 * Make them from 3D plane to screen plane<br/>
<br/>
They shoot themselves at document origin.<br/>
<br/>
If the symbol instance on drawing was at layer plane, they would become layer plane.<br/>

Expected: what&#39;s screen plane, stays screen plane.

Like its shown in the video, do the following steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
<br/>
Select the group like its shown in the video and go to edit mode.<br/>
<br/>
Activate the Select Similar Tool and select / use the attribute Class in the Tool Preferences.<br/>
<br/>
With the Tool active, select one of the Symbols like its shown in the video. It should be 120 Symbols shown in the OI.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards press cmd+c (with Mac).<br/>
The ghost objects will be created, but won&#39;t stay permanently in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
As a last step, still with the Select Similar Tool active, click again in one of Symbols.<br/>
Now the ghost objects will stay permanently inside the group, every time that the Select Similar Tool is active.

I don&#39;t now if this is a bug or work as designed. Should it also be possible to edit an 3D symbol in a layer, when I open the 3D component over the resource manager? On a sheet layer I can only edit the symbol in a wireframe and can&#39;t change render mode.<br/>

If I open VW on the retina display, the opposite is true, so I know that the resources are constructed correctly.

<br/>
Open the bugfile;<br/>
Set layer &quot;Design Layer@0&quot; active; run script &quot;CreateCustomObject() Z-test&quot;.<br/>
Set Layer &quot;Design Layer@12_feet&quot; active; run script again.<br/>
Set layer &quot;Design Layer@-12_feet&quot; active; run script again.<br/>
<br/>
Notice that Z insertion values are neither document zero nor layer zero (either of which would have some logic) but rather the Layer Z offset. This means if my layer z is 12&#39; the object gets inserted at document z +24&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This makes no sense (I almost said &quot;zero sense&quot; :)); CreateCustomObject() should default to local layer zero. Or rather this should be fixed with CreateCustomObjectNew-2().<br/>
<br/>
This is such odd behavior (and so easy to run across) that it seems it could be a regression. But who can say? It&#39;s kind of a jaw-dropper.

In German you would use different words for &quot;Component&quot; for arch. and landscape objects. For wall, slab and roof (roof face) we would use components = Schalen. But for hardscape, landscape area and site model you have to use components = Schichten.<br/>
<br/>
Using the word Schalen for landscape objects sounds funny in german and gives our customers the impression, that we know nothing about landscaping.<br/>
<br/>
I tracked it down to dialog Vectorworks.vwr/Strings/WallSlabRoofDialogs.vwstrings. Please double this dialog for landscape objects or s.th. else.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I try to use Components = Schalen/Schichten (or singular component = Schale/Schicht) in this dialog, which is a workaround, but not a real solution.<br/>
<br/>
We had this problem also in 2021, but there it was only hardscape and we postponed it to 2022. Now we have three objects. So, s.th. must be done here. Thanx.

When deleting the layers  &quot;Schnitt&quot; and &quot;Ansicht aus 3D&quot;, then it works. The two layers do contain sections. So somehow the sections of these two layers must influence the wall behavior.

<br/>
A user has reported this issue and I have tested this in house and it would seem it&#39;s an issue with the attributes of the wall being set/changed after the insertion of a window or Door. The caps don&#39;t update. <br/>
<br/>
Please see the example file and video of the process and showing the issue. <br/>
<br/>
If you change the attributes of the class the wall is assigned to, this doesn&#39;t come through to the caps. However, if you take the window out the wall and reinsert it takes on the changes. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need any more information <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks <br/>

A lot of our clients report this bug to us as very annoying. They using the tool &quot;wall end cap&quot; for custom end caps in combination with the attributes from the components. By more Components in one Wall style with different thick lines on the right and left pen, those end caps are wrong in the result.<br/>
<br/>
I attached a test file with different situations to show you, what I mean.<br/>
Thank you for testing.<br/>

-Select the feature and apply the &quot;Stato costruzione&quot; record format<br/>

Note that this causes the feature to disappear in all render modes, even though it&#39;s still selectable.<br/>

In past versions this would cause the feature to get completely deleted, but in 2021 it just disappears.

                                            <td class="description">      Steps to reproduce<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a wall or round wall.<br/>
2. Create a roof with the roof face command.<br/>
3. Select the wall and roof and run the &quot;Fit walls to objects&quot; command.<br/>
4. It seems that the wall might distort and some panels of round walls might lack when fulfilling conditions.<br/>
 But we couldn&#39;t find the cause of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached file &quot;Sample12649.vwx&quot; and screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
You can see that there are three issues.<br/>
<br/>
In 1) the edge of the wall is distorted.<br/>
<br/>
In 2) some panels are missing.<br/>
<br/>
In 3) a part of wall is protruding from the roof.<br/>
<br/>
In our environment, we were able to reproduce the problems 1) and 3).<br/>
<br/>
However, we couldn&#39;t reproduce the problem 2), aside of the file (Sample12649.vwx) that our user provided.<br/>

I have no way of telling if &quot;USGS_LPC_VA_FEMA-NRCS_SouthCentral_2017_D17_17SNB35500250.laz&quot; is truly corrupt or if VW does not understand the file format completely.<br/>

In the attached file 2022SP2[RC4]-latlongNOTset.vwx, the site was found by placing a GIS Stake object and using Set Geolocation to known values in the OIP. Observe how when Geolocated to the S/W crn of the GeoImage (E:323,000, N:5,814,000) a User Origin IS placed (preserving the map grid). Note also, the Doc Geo Settings are switch on automatically (as one expects). <br/>
In the attached file 2022SP2[RC4]-latlongSET.vwx, the doc geo lat/long is defined prior using the same known values as above. Observe how no User Origin is automatically generated. Subsequently, when the geolocation of the same file is adjusted using the Geolocate Tool from the GIS toolset, a User Origin IS NOT placed.

Objects display also changes every time that we move the objects to a different location.<br/>

If the objects are copied to a new empty file, the problem will not happen in that new file, hence this seems to be file specific.

These levels can be viewed in 2D due to a horizontal section view. The levels are imported in Vectorworks as design layers.<br/>
<br/>
The strange thing with the added document is: all imported layers are imported at an elevation of &quot;0&quot;, all objects get their correct height by z- heights and bottom offsets. This is a very nontransparent and confusing way to get your document in Vectorworks. I don&#39;t have Revit on my computer, so I have to guess how this document is originally build up.<br/>
<br/>
This issue can have 3 different origins:<br/>
<br/>
- The Revit user crated all levels at a height of &quot;0&quot; and adjusted his object manually with a bottom offset and adjusted manually his cut heights to get the right plan view. This is very unlikely, because it is a very confusing way to work in Revit as well. But if this is the case, of course the Revit user himself is to blame and this Jira issue shouldn&#39;t exist. (off course, all pronouns can be replaced by the female or any other equivalent)<br/>
<br/>
- This is just how the import is designed to work, levels import as design layers with an elevation of &quot;0&quot;, no matter what the height of the levels is in Revit. In this case, this issue should be an Enhancement Request.<br/>
<br/>
-This is a bug (general bug or specific for this document, I can&#39;t compare). In this case, this issue is placed right here.<br/>
<br/>
Tech support was not able to answer all of my questions about this issue, That&#39;s why i&#39;m not sure yet this is either a bug or this works as designed. you are the last station for me to get some answers.<br/>

I think it depends on Os settings.

 # Open a new document<br/>
 # In the attribute palette select the fill color picker<br/>
 # Notice there are the document default colors<br/>
 # Open the Vectorworks preferences dialog<br/>
 # Select the Interactive tab and select the Interactive Appearance Settings...<br/>
 # Select a few items in the list with different colors<br/>
 # Close all the dialogs with either OK or cancel<br/>
 # Open the fill color selection again<br/>
<br/>
_Notice that the color that was already set has now been added to your list of document colors.  Unless I&#39;m missing something this seems to be doing nothing but adding clutter to an open document._

The save palate positions command has a number of issues.<br/>

1. users are not aware of what exactly is being stored?<br/>
2. do palettes get resized or simply repositioned?<br/>
3. There should be a load saved palettes menu command. I do not always want to load the workspace<br/>

The garbled characters change depending on the combination of fonts and characters and the ON / OFF of the Subset fonts option in the Export PDF dialog. <br/>
By the way, the result of opening and printing with &quot;Preview&quot; of macOS or &quot;Acrobat Reader DC&quot; of Windows is not garbled. <br/>
<br/>
Example of font and character combinations that have been confirmed to be garbled:<br/>
  Font: &quot;Hiragino Kakugo Pro W3&quot; - Characters: &quot;Numbers&quot;, &quot;Alphabet&quot;, &quot;Hiragana&quot;<br/>
  Font: &quot;Arial&quot; - Character: &quot;Hiragana&quot;<br/>
Printer and app used:<br/>
  Printer: Canon iR-ADV C5255F<br/>
  app: Acrobat Reader DC (Continuous Release | Version 2021.005.20048)<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction method:<br/>
1) Open the sample file &quot;12596.vwx&quot;. Characters exist in the worksheet or in the group where the worksheet is converted by &quot;Convert to Group&quot;.<br/>
2) Execute File&gt; Export PDF ... from the menu.<br/>
3) Export 2 patterns of ON and OFF of Subset fonts option. (Settings other than the Subset fonts option remain the default settings.)<br/>
4) Open each of the exported PDF files with Acrobat Reader DC on macOS and print them.<br/>
5) As a result of printing, the characters are garbled. And as a result of comparing with the Subset fonts option ON and OFF, the garbled characters are different.<br/>
Also check the &quot;Print PDF of Subset fonts_ON.jpeg&quot; and &quot;Print PDF of Subset fonts_ON.jpeg&quot; which are the photographs of the printed matter. <br/>

None of the render settings have changed from one render to the next, nor has that geometry.<br/>
<br/>
The one with less AO shading would be considered the &#39;incorrect&#39; one based on how it usually renders.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve encountered this issue or something like it periodically since 2021 came out, and perhaps older versions as well? So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fluke in this file, but I&#39;m also not sure the exact scenario that&#39;s causing it...<br/>

This particular viewport has some Data Vis applied as well, but I&#39;ve had similar AO irregularities with regular Renderworks renderings too.

Going to design layer and making all classes and layers visible, I am unable to move into a 3D mode.  I discovered a light symbol has become corrupt.  Deleting the symbols highlighted in my screen shot, the file starts to behave as expected, and his viewport will now render correctly.<br/>

I have told the beta tester to remove and replace the symbol with new ones.<br/>

Really he should be testing and submitting this himself.

As these items are classed as Lighting Devices, then it seems inconsistent that this feature is not available. It would also be very useful as many Accessories look very similar to each other and having to dig through the Object Information Palette to find the precise symbol name is time-consuming and prone to error.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This also does not seem to allow the Spotlight - Reports - Lighting Symbol Maintenance work as well.  I can edit things in there but they do not seem to actually apply to the fixtures. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For me this is very critical as I find it is often easier to layout 2D symbols not as lighting devices and just convert them later.  We do a lot of work where things follow paths etc and distributing as 2D symbols seem to work better.

Ch 440...can be selected by dragging a marquee box around the light regardless of whether the beam is showing or not. Ch 472, which is a different symbol, is selected via a marquee box when the beam is not showing, but when the beam is showing, the marquee box does not select the light. I can&#39;t quite tell what does allow the light to become selected. You don&#39;t have to select the entire beam, but maybe at least the center of the beam? Not sure what is causing this...seems like a bug? Or if there is not a bug, there is something that is creating inconsistent behavior that should not be.

You will see that the hatch doesn&#39;t rotate with the viewport. I consider this behavior incorrect, because:<br/>
- When you disable &quot;accelerate graphics&quot; the hatch does show rotated (as it should)<br/>
- When you print the or export the sheet layer to PDF, the hatch shows rotated as wall (no matter the graphics setting at that moment)

<br/>
1) Open the sample file. (12630_UnifiedView OFF.vwx)<br/>
　There are an Extrude and a Heliodon object.<br/>
2) Run Shaded.<br/>
3) Select the Heliodon object and click &quot;Solar Animation...&quot; from OIP.<br/>
4) Click &quot;Export Movie&quot; tab in the Solar Animation dialog and click OK.<br/>
5) Place the time and date text.<br/>
6) &quot;Video Settings&quot; dialog shows and click OK. And save the movie to any destination.<br/>
7) Date and time don&#39;t show on the exported movie.<br/>
 (Please see &quot;OFF.mov&quot; movie. These steps are recorded.)<br/>
<br/>
If creating solar animations with turning on Unified View with following the steps above, date and time show on the movie.<br/>
　(Please see &quot;ON.mov&quot;)<br/>

*As long as I tried, I see this problem also Vectorworks 2021.<br/>

<br/>
This is an issue in the criteria dialog where it would be ideal to be able to remove an image when changing the interaction edit control type for a column item that has an image already set. If this is not possible, it would be useful to have the ability to set a column to the original default settings it had when it was first created.<br/>
<br/>
This criteria dialog issue was fixed by use of a workaround, changelist 602198, implemented in criteria dialog code; VB-179858.

<br/>
I noticed that signal types descriptions from connectCAD_Data/SignalTypes.txt were localized. However, the ConnectorTypes.txt descriptions were not localized. The description can be localized I think but if they are localized for signals, they should be localized for connectors too, as both are visible in the UI<br/>
<br/>
The socket symbols in the default content (skt_txt_L, skt_txt_*, skt_con_*) and the terminator symbol should not be localized, since we still do not have a better way to implement this.<br/>
<br/>
Strings like “%02d” should not be localized, as this is a string format that represents a floating point number with a precision of 2 digits. The same goes for “%s”, “%d”, “%f”, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We have some placeholder strings in the localization texts, such as “&lt;NumSys&gt;, &lt;make&gt;, &lt;model&gt;, etc.” (all placed within &lt;&gt;) which are placeholders for replacing and should not be localized. If it is not possible to not localize these and we should use %1, %2 or %s (even though these are meaningless in the string and do not help in understanding the context), let me know so that we can take care of this.

This was mac, and was consistent for a short period.  It stopped when I restarted VW. Not sure if closing and reopening the dialog would stop it. Haven&#39;t seen it since. Palette was not docked.<br/>

_Notice all the palette tabs appear.  This is a disconnect with the term hide.  Using the word hide implies you are hiding it in it&#39;s current state.  But I don&#39;t see a way to get it back in it&#39;s current state._ <br/>
<br/>
_An analogy of this term would be if I hide a browser window from my desktop into the task bar, then when I bring it back up, my open pages are gone and I&#39;m met with a homepage instead.  This is what seems to be happening here._<br/>
<br/>
_If this is expected behavior, I would suggest removing the term hide and replacing it with remove._

<br/>
Do a &quot;complete export on exit&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Launch Lightwright, connect to the .xml file<br/>
<br/>
Look at Floor Unit #1 in Lightwright, see the Label Legend is &quot;C.F 12&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In Lightwright, edit the Label Legend for that light to &quot;CB Add/Cir&quot;. This is the name of an existing label legend in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
In a text editor, open the .xml file and notice that the new label legend has correctly been assigned to the light. Close the .xml file.<br/>
<br/>
Click on Vectorworks, it will process the .xml file, leaving it mostly empty.<br/>
<br/>
Look at Floor Unit #1 in Vectorworks, the label legend still says &quot;C.F. 12&quot;. Vectorworks read the .xml file, but it did not assign the incoming label legend.<br/>
<br/>
This is easily reproduced, and is not new to this build. My customer reported it using a released version of VW 2022.<br/>

In Top view, GS_GetToolPt2D will shift according to the user origin, while GS_GetToolPt3D behaves as expected.<br/>

I believe the behavior of GS_GetToolPt2D is a bug. While only retrieving 3D tool points is an easy workaround, this could easily lead to bugs with tools and PIO insertion.

<br/>
Hatches with the property that they rotated in walls are misaligned, if the viewport is rotated. This relates to the problem with the navigation graphics &quot;best performance&quot;. If I zoom on the sheet layer, the rotation of the hatches in the walls are correct, also when I export the layer as PDF. It would be nice when the viewport shows the suitable view on the sheet layer. So it would not so confused for some customers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>

The Customer informed us that after editing the Hatch local mapping length, Vectorworks crashed when clicking back on the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
By giving a size of Zero, got a warning that the size must be bigger than zero, which is WAD. Afterwards has given a size of eg. 0,3m and clicked back on the drawing causing Vectorworks to crash.

However, Vectorworks seems to be applying the opacity to each individual segment of the polyline, rather than the overall object. This leads to the unsightly appearance of dark splotches where the segment points overlap, instead of a uniform 50% value.

Method SpinAsPolyline does not look to be safe. It takes an object of kOvalNode type and converts it to kPolylineNode. This handle is passed by reference and presumably can be used after return.<br/>

This method is used only at SpinObjectManUnld for ovals under some conditions.<br/>

It would be good if an engineer who has better understanding of the case can look into this.<br/>

    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Customer has this misfunction already one year, but until now it was not possible to save one project file with missing data, one workfile with missing and one with complete data.<br/>
But those files do have the disadvantage, that the failure already have happened and I have no way to reproduce it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the reason for the report in which is not really a bugrport but asking for help.<br/>
Customer is working with 2019. I know, in older version of Vectorworks there have been many undo bugs, which could now in 2022 and also 2021 been corrected.<br/>
But customer says that the misfunction is still with 2021 SP3. Okay, maybe the failure came into 2021 when converting those old files? Maybe customer should have revised those files first? But how?<br/>
<br/>
Files HOB-06__VW19_pccad31.vwxw and HOB-06__VW19.vwxp do have missing data. See pink revision cloud for missing dimensions.<br/>
File HOB-06__VW19_pccad42.vwxw does have these missing dimensions. But there is no way to these into the project file. It seems, that the project file already have received them but lost somehow. Guess that is the reason that a newly created workfile has 10 MB less size.<br/>
<br/>
The problem disappears if a new project file is created.<br/>
<br/>
Customer says that he has this problem 1-2 per week (project with the most errors). It seems to affect all project of that customer. Maybe something with workflow or hardware?<br/>
<br/>
Project Sharing via SMB. Project file is on a central server (NAS), working files are local on Windows.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have possibilities to look into files and maybe you habe had customers with similiar problems and could give me some advices.<br/>

If the checkbox &quot;Reset All PlugIn Objects&quot; in the Export PDF settings is on, the space label get&#39;s lost / receive wrong scale with Export PDF.<br/>

From my point of view, this checkbox should not update the space labels.<br/>

Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a few Lighting Devices on different layers, where one of the layers is grayed.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, right-click on the &quot;USITT 10BP 1.NNA-3&quot; light in the Visualization palette and choose &quot;Force Select&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Lighting Device gets selected and its layer (&quot;Design Layer-2&quot;) seems to get activated, but the Nav palette and mode bar still show &quot;Design Layer-1&quot; as being active.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem with classes so it only seems to affect layers.

 <br/>
<br/>
My Vectorworks updater doesn&#39;t work properly, and gives me an connectivity issue. Quite strange because I don&#39;t have any internet related issues.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I assume this is a bug? I had this issue before, and had to uninstall VWX.

<br/>
I have attached a file where the client has imported a Flexijet3D siurvey. He extracts the imported polys to create VWX objects for planning. Very often, the extracted 2D planar objects do not match their parent primitives. Once, this 2D planar object is extruded, the discrepancy rectifies itself. <br/>
<br/>
This is not so much serious as it is irritating because it gives users the impression that VWX is imprecise. It also creates A LOT of support traffic because our clients use digital laser surveying equipment more often these days.

Observe how the texture mapping of the 2nd., 3rd. and 4th. components are not rendering correctly. <br/>
(Note: Component 1 texture is rendering correctly.)<br/>
Changing the Map type in the Render tab of the OIP does not resolve the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The Group to the right (in the attached image) was created using the Convert to Group command. <br/>
Component 2 was edited and the 3d (mesh) polygons were &#39;closed&#39;. <br/>
This action resulted in the Component 2 texture rendering correctly. <br/>
[Editing the Component 2 mesh a second time reveals the polygons are no longer &#39;closed&#39; however the rendering appears unaffected.]

we received the attached file from a client. Project was made in v2021.<br/>
If you open it with 2022 and you updates the Viewports, you may notice that the lines around doors and windows are in magenta. In the original project there is an override to the class &quot;muratura&quot; to render the pen in black. This override is not considered in version 2022 so the pen is rendered with the wrong color.<br/>

Note that in 619242 everything prints to pdf as expected. However notice that in build 621161 there are some serious missing portions of the (rendered) viewports as well as weird/erroneous &quot;X&#39;s&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
[NOTE: after creation I applied gray scaling to the 619242 pdf. I did not with the flawed pdf. After the fact I did apply the gray scale filter, curious if it would reduce the pdf file size down to the same or close to the 619242 pdf. It did not. I have also attached that pdf as I think you might want to look into why the size of the flawed pdf is so much larger than the correct one.]<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>

-Select the object and activate the Attribute Mapping tool<br/>
-Click on the front face as shown<br/>
-In the Render tab of the OIP, change the texture mapping in any way<br/>
-Switch back to the 2D Selection tool<br/>
-Now Undo the mapping change<br/>
<br/>
Note that this causes the face&#39;s &quot;Repeat Vertical&quot; and &quot;Repeat Horizontal&quot; options to become disabled in the OIP, so the texture now only shows one repetition.<br/>

To reproduce the problem from the scratch do the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open a blank new document.<br/>
<br/>
2. Create a new Sheet Layer.<br/>
<br/>
3. Go to File &gt; Page Setup and select &quot;Choose size unavailable in printer setup&quot; and use for example ISO A1.<br/>
<br/>
4. Select the Title Block Border Tool and use the Style provided in the attached files as example, but with US Arch NCS 02 the outer line was also not present in the PDF Export.<br/>
<br/>
5. Make sure to have &quot;Fit to Printable Area&quot; selected or the same ISO as the Page Setup. Result will be the same. Press OK to close the Dialog.<br/>
<br/>
6. After setting the TBB, export to PDF.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
-Enter the viewport&#39;s &quot;Section In-Place&quot; edit mode<br/>
-Render in OpenGL/Shaded or RW<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021, note that the textures show correctly (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, note that the textures fail too show on several objects (see second screenshot)<br/>
<br/>
If you open the file, switch to the design layer and render, then switch back to the sheet and repeat the above steps, the problem won&#39;t occur.<br/>
<br/>
This happens in 2022 SP0, SP1, and SP2.

 # In a VP, with OpenGL and Hidden Line, the lines are much sharper<br/>
 # In Enscape, the “outlines” can be adjusted by percentage to thicker or thinner – much like SketchUp<br/>

First, I&#39;m unable to draw a line starting elsewhere that snaps to the tangent point of an arc/circle.<br/>
<br/>
Second, drawing a line that starts on the end point of an arc seems to let me draw the line tangent to the arc only if I hold the Shift key, but even then it doesn&#39;t display the Smart Cursor cue nor the dashed extension line.<br/>
<br/>
Screen recording of these two issues attached.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed this in 2021. Now that I&#39;m also trying it in 2022, I see that the tangent snap button is just disabled entirely when inside Extrudes.<br/>
<br/>
We need to be able to edit the 2D geometry within Extrudes the SAME way we that can outside of extrudes, including having full tangent snaps.

See VB-180639, VB-180811. Problem appears sometimes, and I was not able to reproduce it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes immediately after VW started I saw tools not reacting. For example, I selected the Rectangle tool, but was not able to draw a rectangle until I clicked on a palette and back on the drawing. Maybe related. <br/>
<br/>
Today I caught such situation and found that reason for notifications being ignored is fSuspendUpdate == true in TNotify::UpdatePendingRequests.<br/>
<br/>
This flag is set in TNotify::NotificationHandler on kNotifyBeginToolMode.<br/>
<br/>
My guess it could have been caused by CL 557761. Maybe some extra begins not followed by ends.

-Instead of clicking &quot;Ok&quot;, click &quot;Cancel&quot; notice the view doesn&#39;t revert back<br/>

<br/>
Could the orthogonal or diagonal quotations be improved for chain or series quotations?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2 possible points of improvement:<br/>
- When we have a chain dimension, when we want to quote the height the possibility to put suffix/prefix/note, puts it on all the dimensions so not practical. It should be possible to annotate the chain quotations separately.<br/>
- In the same principle why when everything is drawn in 3D, the height of door or window is not automatically set if we want, for example by adding it in the object info palette<br/>

<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/56398-viewport-camera-automatically-activated/]<br/>
<br/>
When editing a RW camera via a viewport, choosing the Edit Camera option takes you to the camera object within the Design Layer context, and selects it, but it does not Activate the camera. Therefore when you make changes to the view and return to the viewport and render it, nothing has changed. I&#39;ve seen this trip up users (including myself) many many times over the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t have to manually remember to Activate it every single time. The camera should be automatically Activated when choosing Edit Camera, and in the thread Jim Wilson mentioned that this is how it is supposed to work.

On my machine the render seems to complete around the 15:00 mark, but the progress bar still shows 0% at that point. The progress bar then keeps going for another 12 minutes or so before finally getting to 100% and showing the render as complete. <br/>

The final render looks exactly the same as the render at the 15:00 mark, so I don&#39;t think the extra 12 minutes is actually doing anything...

&quot;Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
This file is very difficult to navigate. Once I finally got it into a top plan mode on the design layer, I turned all classes and layers to visible and then fit to objects and I see some 37 large objects 1.2 million by 2.6 million meters away from where the model is.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect these objects / geometry is causing the issue you describe. You may be able to clean this up for them or have them determine what these objects are and either move them or remove them to see if the problem persists.<br/>
<br/>
Even when I remove those items I am still finding objects strewn far from the model.<br/>
<br/>

After deleting these objects, the problem still presisted, so these objects are not the cause of this issue.

I am able to get a movie with All High settings and 1 frame per second. I think the issue occurs when there are a lot more frames to render, which I believe can be a sign of a memory leak?<br/>
<br/>
Please investigate what is the reason why Vectorworks is unable to produce a High quality Renderworks animation at a higher frame rate. <br/>
I also received the attached Cinerender error dialog - I believe Cinerender has crashed during one of my rendering attempts.

set viewport to any sheet<br/>

notice model view is cut<br/>
<br/>
try using the walkthrough tool, and notice model cut away from view<br/>

this bug can be avoided if after creating viewport - render viewport in any render mode other than OpenGL.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
 # Open the attached file [^Ski_Lodge_OpenGL_Test_2.vwx]<br/>
 # Once everything is loaded, take note of the current graphics performance<br/>
 # Create a new render style using redshift<br/>
 # Uncheck all features in the options tab<br/>
 # Render in the design layer using the new render style<br/>

Notice that once the render finishes, the card continues to be used as if it&#39;s still working.  For me (without screen recording) it would jump 1500MH on the GPU clock speed.

To reproduce, open the file in VW 2021 and 2022 and update the viewports in each version.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Section Viewport shows one of the solids incorrectly in 2022 (see attached screenshots).<br/>

This object has a brown fill color applied so it looks like the render is showing the fill color instead of the texture.

I was exploring the various Artistic Renderworks style options, and as I switched from one style to another in the popup to view the previews, I got the Beta Undo Alert 4. I was switching styles pretty quickly, but I think it was the Hatch style selection that brought up the alert. Of course, the alert didn&#39;t just go away, but I switched to a couple of other types, and then back to Hatch, and a chime sounded, which I assume means the alert was triggered again. I did that twice, and got the chime both times.

Create roof face, apply roof texture to top of roof. Cut section through roof and see the hatch show up in viewport.  Go back to the design layer and add a skylight and the hatch will not render in the updated viewport

<br/>
A user has sent in a query about grass not rendering correctly on geometry in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
All seems fine in 2020 rendering as it should. <br/>
<br/>
All fine for rendering on extrudes, However Generic solids, fillets, etc all render incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
I have also replicated this in a blank file with one of the library textures on an extrude and a Generic solid. Extrude works, Generic Solid doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also tried rendering on the cloud and still the same outcome. <br/>
<br/>
Please find example files attached of 2020 and 2021. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need any more information. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;d be grateful for some assistance with this model which has been sent in by a customer. <br/>
<br/>
He is trying to use Renderworks textures with the Grass shader, within texture beds on a site model. His textures are correctly set up, and his Renderworks style has Grass activated. But we are not seeing any blades of grass!<br/>
<br/>
I have tested this in a different file, and the grass shader is doing its job (See Grass on Site Model attached).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, in his file (also attached), we just can&#39;t get it to behave. <br/>
<br/>
We have checked:<br/>
 * Origins<br/>
 * Set up of grass textures<br/>
 * Set up of site model (which layers etc)<br/>
<br/>
All looks fine.<br/>
<br/>
We have also extracted (via layer import) the relevant bits of the model for testing this (just to rule out other things) and this is what&#39;s in the attached file. <br/>
<br/>
We are rendering in the cloud for speed, but no matter what we try, NO GRASS.<br/>
<br/>
Any genius ideas would be gratefully received. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!

 * the problem is that planar objects are brought forward (to address coplanar z-fighting with surfaces) too much for this file.  Changing the offset number too small may introduce z-fighting.  Maybe there could be a SetPref secret or a Shaded Preference to allow user to control the number ?<br/>

ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION:<br/>
<br/>
There is a Blue Polygon, the orange &quot;Glow Glass&quot; texture of a wall component and the &quot;Glow Glass&quot; texture applied to a 3d Polygon that bleed through when navigating.  For instance, depending on the view:<br/>
<br/>
1) The blue polygon on the site will override the slab that is above the polygon.<br/>
<br/>
2) The &quot;Glow Glass&quot; texture of a wall component which is on the inner face of the wall will appear to be on the outer face of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
3) The &quot;Glow Glass&quot; texture applied to a 3d Polygon is not part of the Slab above it but it will appear to be on the top of the slab.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This has been happening for some time in this file.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.

I&#39;ve attached a document where we can see this occurring, and please let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can help clarify!<br/>
<br/>
We can work around this by using a Hidden Line foreground and another render mode as the background, but it&#39;d be nice to be able to simply do it all in Open GL.<br/>

 # Open the “Export Shapefile.vwx” file<br/>

 # Export objects:<br/>
 - with the record RoadPly<br/>
 - with classes Road-1 and Road-2 <br/>
 - in layers Design Layer-1 and Design Layer-2<br/>
 - choose &quot;Keep projection&quot; and &quot;Write projection files (.prj)&quot;<br/>
 # Import exported shape file and zoom in/ zoom out<br/>
<br/>
I think that there is problem with importing shape files only on MAC because I tried to reproduce this behavior on Windows and there is no problem. Also I imported on Windows exported shape file from MAC ( try with shape file from attached _Shape_file_MAC.zip_ ) and everything looks okay.

There are existing workflows that require the &quot;Convert to:&quot; objects to be aligned with the original objects in the current 3D view, so ideally these would get placed on the 3D plane that&#39;s aligned with the current view (in this case the &quot;Screen Aligned&quot; plane).

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Let me first say that any time Vectorworks exports a PDF that looks different than what we see in Vectorworks, this is VERY BAD. This leads to errors that aren&#39;t caught before distributing documents.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of this bug, it&#39;s possible to end up with a PDF that has upside down or backwards text, even though the text looks correct in Vectorworks. This bug has existed for a while and has caused great headache recently.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the steps to reproduce, which can be seen in the attached screen recording:<br/>
 # Have the Document Preference &quot;Adjust flipped text&quot; turned off.<br/>
 # Have a Sheet Layer Viewport.<br/>
 # Have some text in the viewport Annotations, then mirror the text with the Mirror tool. (This bug only affects text in Annotations)<br/>
 # The text appears correct on the screen.<br/>
 # Export a PDF. The text is in fact flipped in the exported PDF. This is very bad, and since it&#39;s different than Vectorworks, it&#39;s very easy to miss this error.<br/>
<br/>
An underlying cause is that viewports have their own &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; preference under Advanced Properties in the OIP, which seems to conflict with the document preference of the same name.*<br/>
<br/>
If a viewport has &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; on, I would assume this supersedes the document preference. Alternatively, an argument could be made that turning off &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; on a Document level should disengage it globally. Either way it needs to be consistent, but right now it&#39;s not. Vectorworks displays it one way and exports it another, and this should be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
BTW, if I uncheck &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; for the viewport as well, then the text is accurately displayed as upside down or backwards and I can see that it needs to be addressed manually. However, this should not be necessary, as viewports always default with this setting checked, so it&#39;s easy to end up with errors.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*As an aside, the UX of having these two conflicting settings is confusing, and it&#39;s hard to interpret how or what takes precedence. This should probably also be addressed with a VE. Perhaps the Viewport  &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; setting could have the options of On, Off, or Use Document Preference (which should be the new default).

How to reproduce the problem:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached .vwx file<br/>
<br/>
2. Publish to PDF like its shown in the video.<br/>
<br/>
3. Open the published PDF with Adobe Acrobat.<br/>
<br/>
4. Click where is the Sheet Number, for example BS_01 or BS_02<br/>
<br/>
Result: it will show a &quot;e-mail link&quot; and it will open the email app.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the name of the Sheet Number makes no difference, the result is always the same.

When you hold the keyboard shortcut to suspend snapping, instead of being able to smoothly draw the rectangle the cursor instead snaps to 1/8&quot; increments. I have no idea what&#39;s causing this, but it happens both in 2021 and 2022. I can also recreate this by starting a blank file, making an extrude, switching to perspective, then trying to draw on a surface while suspending snapping.<br/>
<br/>
I also notice that if I change the Design Layer scale it affects the spacing of these erroneous snaps.<br/>
<br/>
Screen recording attached. You can tell when I&#39;m holding the suspend snapping hotkey by looking at yellow indicator in the utility bar. The 1/8&quot; snap grid ironically only occurs when snapping is suspended.

I am trying to add text to a symbol in 3d.  I do this semi-regularly without issue.  In this one, I have a 3d symbol I&#39;m editing.  I type text, which as a separate note does not really appear to be visible while editing and end the edit mode.  I have the text selected go-to text - convert text to polylines.  It converts them but not close to the size it previously was and in a big jumble rather than as it typically works.

<br/>
The VW file has a 2D Symbol which after exporting to PDF, it is not displayed as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Various options were used, downrate, compression, rasterize.<br/>
<br/>
Rasterize being the only one that makes the 2D Symbol being correctly displayed, but as expected Rasterize also decreases the quality of the export and greatly increases the size of the PDF, as warned.<br/>
<br/>
We do hope that is not a must to have Rasterize active to correctly export the 2D Symbol and a solution for this problem can be found, thank you in advance.<br/>

<br/>
We have a user reporting inconsistency with PDF sizes and we can replicate this. <br/>
<br/>
When you first open Vectorworks and the file if you export the sheet (VP01- Footpath 108), it exports as 3.6mb. However if you then go and export again, without changing anything the PDF comes out as 11.1mb. For some reason there is a considerable increase in size with no change to the document. <br/>
<br/>
Please find attached the users file and also PDF tests. <br/>
<br/>
If you then close Vectorworks down and relaunch it will export the PDF as 3.6mb and then anything after is 11.1mb again. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>
Helen <br/>

<br/>
By a PDF export with tiles, these are calculated for the bounding area of the object. This is a Problem, when the Objects are rotates. An example: a wall with the length of 100m is rotated with an angle from 45°. Consequently is the area from the bounding box ca. 70m x 70m. In this area are the tile calculates. This has an effect on the data volume.<br/>
In the attachments are two exports:<br/>
Ohne Titel 12 = 27.6mb (with tile)<br/>
Ohne Titel 13 = 11kb (without tile)<br/>
<br/>
I attach also my test file.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Draw a marquee around the Shell to select it (this is needed due to the bug reported in VB-179068)<br/>
-Run the Modify/Move/Move command and move it any distance<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the object disappears in static views and is only visible while navigation is active.<br/>

This is a regression from 2021.

<br/>
User mentions that they have to select each viewport and toggle the Grid 3D layer invisible and back to grey to get all grids to reappear.  In many cases doing so loses the viewport formatting of the gridline.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, we tested this on sheet  A1.04 RCP.  I could see upon opening that sheet layer that only a few gridlines were visible.  I navigated to the GRID 3D to see all the gridlines were visible.  I chose Grid 14 as it was not visible in the viewport and could see that its instance was not set to be visible in that viewport.<br/>
<br/>
Navigated back to sheet layer A1.04 and in the OIP toggled the GRID 3D layer to invisible then back to grey.  All the grids showed up.  Navigated back to the GRID 3D layer and chose grid 14 again and can see its instance is now set to be visible in Viewport A1.04<br/>
<br/>
User will toggle the layer off and on in the viewport and all will work for a while, but when reopening the file a day or two later, the visibility has changed back to missing random gridlines.

The extension is shown on the .vwx. It must be extended along a curved path, the same as the curve of the outer handrail of the stairs, which has a 27&#39;4&quot; radius. It would cover a sweep of about 2.51°. They have sent 2 screenshots which may be of help.  The first image shows the path (in red) they would like to bend the extension to. The second picture shows the extension from a front view but it is straight, not bent.<br/>
<br/>
The process of bending using the bend option in the deform tool seem to work for this object when bending at severe angles greater than 45° but not for smaller angles.

<br/>
This issue seems to be happening after the Windows 10 20H2 update.<br/>
<br/>
The only way around this is to set the laptop screen as the main display in the display settings and let Vectorworks open up on the laptop screen.  Once Vectorworks is open, it behaves as normal.  The user can unplug the dock and plug it back in without issues when Vectorworks is open.

I created a dynamic attribute by checking the Symbol box, except the symbol is not taken into account.<br/>
My initial wish was to create a dynamic attribute by showing all objects without IFC in red and objects with an IFC entity in gray &quot;colonne romaine 3.25m&quot; , when the symbol has an IFC entity it always remains in red, while it should be in grayed out, so this means that the symbols are not taken into account in the dynamic attributes

If 2022 allows center mark for regular polygon then object need to show red highlighting and also it should constrain to object.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the Site Modifiers tool in Pathway Path Mode<br/>
-Draw an object as shown, using the red locus points to snap to<br/>
-Now activate the Reshape tool in Longitudinal Profile Mode<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Longitudinal line only has a few vertices.<br/>
<br/>
-Now activate the Site Modifiers tool in Boundary Path Mode<br/>
-Draw another object as shown, using the blue locus points to snap to<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Longitudinal line has 90+ vertices.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense that the two would give different results based on the way they work, but ideally there&#39;d be some background code that simplifies the profile line to keep the same basic shape while reducing the number of vertices. Users will most likely need to do some manual tweaking of these lines and that gets really difficult with so many vertices.

<br/>
These are the instructions from Justin and Dave:<br/>
       - Run the attached “FPS Testing ON” script in VW 2021 and VW 2022 (this shows FPS in the bottom-left and sets the view transition animation to 5 sec)<br/>
       - Open the test files in VW 2021 and create some saved views if there aren&#39;t any (5 saved views should be enough)<br/>
       - Activate a saved view and then Pan slightly<br/>
       - Activate the saved view again and estimate the average framerate over the 5 seconds it takes for the view transition to complete<br/>
       - Open the same file in VW 2022 and repeat the same steps<br/>
       - Record results for both versions in [this spreadsheet|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1clDsAK2G-08L5gn9pocilMSgBZUJM-JgtJiuAgFow-k/edit?usp=sharing]<br/>

<br/>
The command &quot;Unfold Surface&quot; is inaccurate. I think that values is for the production industrie (f.ex. wood work or exhibition industry) not precise enough.<br/>
In the attached file you see 4 surface profiles on different position around the origin marker. All 4 surfaces have different values. The coordinates shouldn&#39;t a importance of the values form the surfaces.<br/>

<br/>
Viewport takes excessive time to update.  Noticed this in a file I&#39;ve been using regularly w/o issue on previous builds.  This issue happed in that file and was then reproduced in the file (included) in which all of the previous geometry had been purged to lighten the load.<br/>
<br/>
Issue 1 - Updating the viewport to reflect the new geometry takes way too long.<br/>
<br/>
Issue 1 - Updating the viewport to reflect change in scale locks up Vectorworks and also severely reduces the ability for any other software functionality outside of Vectorworks.

When trying to change snapping settings using the new palette, while a tool is still active, it is very difficult to keep the drawing area from automatically panning. I guess this is because the cursor hovers outside of the drawing window and the automatic pan is initiated. <br/>
<br/>
Could this function be disabled when a settings popup is activated from this palette?<br/>

I think it isn&#39;t a Bug, it&#39;s more about the performance of the reshape tool. <br/>
In the attachments is a customers file with a lot of detailed objects (lines &amp; polylines). I marked two areas in red rectangles, were the reshape tool has stops and loads longer to reshape the active objects.<br/>

The dialog says there are 498 objects and the script only selects 3 Groups.<br/>

Bugs:<br/>
1) why does dialog say 498and only select 3?<br/>
2) why are the three objects selected? I do not see any Screen Plan objects. Is this expected? Does the group get treated as screen plane? It might be set to screen plane in the low level data field. But it is not a screen plane object<br/>

<br/>
However, the render still issue seemed reproducible.<br/>
<br/>
While on the call, I was able to load the midsize demo file and reproduce the crash regularly. It appeared based on my tests and feedback from the customer that anytime the Texture Quality used for the Render Still did not match the Texture Quality used for realtime, a crash would occur.<br/>
<br/>
This seemed to occur regardless of whether or not the &quot;&lt;Default&gt;&quot; preset was used or if &quot;&lt;Active Settings&gt;&quot; was used. Note, that when using active settings, you must customize the settings in order to allow the Texture Quality used for realtime / render still to be different.<br/>
<br/>
The customer was on PC and I tested on MacOS.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to post more information in this ticket shortly. I just wanted to open this so I do not forget.

_Notice that because the user in the properties panel, keyboard shortcuts appears to not take.  In this instance it&#39;s an issue as the only way to put the focus back on the viewport is to click which would insert another drummer or ignore the viewport entirely and use the side menu to select the select tool negating the use for the shortcut keys._

This test is meant to show the performance after all the geometry has been cached, so it includes a few extra steps.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the objects on the left in Top/Plan view, then de-select<br/>
-Switch to a 3D view and zoom<br/>
-Return to Top/Plan view and select the objects again<br/>
<br/>
Note that the selection is noticeably slower in 2022 (about 5 seconds compared to 1-2 seconds in 2021). This is an extreme example with lots of objects so this slowdown isn&#39;t quite as noticeable on a smaller scale.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not noticing much of a difference when selecting in 3D views so this might only affect 2D selection.<br/>

Notice the viewport shifts but does not scale along with the group.<br/>
<br/>
Users have come to rely on this method of scaling viewports to allow them to easily create page layouts were specific viewport scale are not necessary.  It allows users to immediately get the viewport to the desired size to the layout.  There are no other ways to get these results quickly and easily.

<br/>
Is the geometry of the tile in an extra class (tile fill) and this class is invisible. The fill isn&#39;t no longer visible in an object as fill, when the navigation graphics is on &quot;good performance and compatibility&quot;. On best performance the fill is visible until to the pdf export. For the export I need to change the visibility from the class &quot;Tile fill&quot; to visible, to see the tile in the export.<br/>
I think the invisible class shouldn&#39;t be a problem for export. Because in the end, the geometry is used as an image fill, thus the visibility should not have any influence on it. So primary I think its a problem of the navigation graphics?<br/>
<br/>
I attached you my test file and a movie with my full steps.<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Denis

See the attached video which demonstrates the issue better than I can describe it. It doesn&#39;t matter which symbol I use or what file I&#39;m in.<br/>

Other tools with previews don&#39;t behave this way, it seems to just be Symbol Insertion.

You will see &quot;out of range SysName&quot; assert.<br/>

This happens because an internal slab has fOldTextureRef != 0 and we have chain of calls:<br/>
TextureTableMapSysNames -&gt; SetTextureRefOld -&gt; SetDefaultTextureSpaceOld -&gt; GetBoundsCube - &gt; Reset3DSlab. Please, see attached Call stack.<br/>
Reset is using some RefNumbers of the parent slab which have not been matched yet.<br/>
<br/>
As I can say this does not cause user problems, possibly only reverse translate problems, but worth fixing.

I&#39;m unable to track down what could cause this on my end. I have been unable to reproduce the hang under the same circumstances. I&#39;m wondering if this could be a workspace issue.

I am also seeing all these new fields that display in OIP are not listed in IFC data dialog<br/>
for example <br/>
Stair Width, Tread Depth fields are missing<br/>
I am not sure if these should display in IFC data dialog<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce this bug:<br/>
 # Enable the time trigger for the SOD in the Vectorworks Preferences dialog, set a timer<br/>
 # Activate a random menu from the menu bar<br/>
 # Mouse hover on a menu command for a few seconds longer than the set timer<br/>
 # Quickly move the cursor onto the drawing area<br/>
<br/>
Notice the SOD will be triggered immediately when you stop moving the cursor without resetting timer.

<br/>
-Make sure the &quot;Show other objects while in editing modes&quot; preference is enabled<br/>
-Enter the 2D Component of the symbol<br/>

In VW 2020, note that the edit mode doesn&#39;t show the geometry of the symbol instance that&#39;s currently being edited.<br/>

<br/>
I have a plug-in with multiple image-based control points (<br/>
<br/>
eCursorHandleType_Image). After a while working in Vectorworks, all but one control point stop displaying. I can still grab the control point if I can find it, but it does not display on screen.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, if I move the window from my external monitor, which is standard resolution, to my retina laptop screen, the control points instantly appear. I can again see them disappear as I drag the window back to the external monitor.<br/>
<br/>
Changing graphics performance to &quot;Best Compatibility&quot; made no difference. I confirmed that the image specs are the same for all the control point images.<br/>
<br/>
I was not able to identify another plug-in that displaced multiple image-based control points at a time to test.<br/>
<br/>
Restarting Vectorworks immediately resolves the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I did notice this message in the console: <br/>
Error in TXImage::GetImageDataFromImageSpecifier.<br/>

I have found that changing the OpenGL quality to Medium or High will fix some of the Truss, but not all. I was also able to reproduce this problem in a new blank file with default Truss from the Library. In my file, I am unable to see the Truss in OpenGL, even after adjusting OpenGL settings, Navigation Graphics, etc. However, the Truss does eventually become visible after exporting the file to Vision.

<br/>
Note: Once the file is saved and reopened in Vectorworks the problem is corrected.  Seems to occur when the symbol is first imported from the Resource Manager.  This is occurring with many different symbols but the most reliable recreation is in the Chauvet Trusst product line.  That symbol&#39;s location is included in the attached screenshot to that testing can be done.<br/>

<br/>
When you run the Export Web View command with the Vectorworks Cloud Services app not running, the Save on dropdown reverts back to Local Storage. If you want to export to VCS, there should be something that tells the user to wait until the Vectorworks Cloud Services app is started and the choice on the menu should be preserved, so they can move forward without having to re-select this option. If the user doesn&#39;t pay attention that the choice is reverted to local storage, it may cause an impression that Cloud storage option is not working properly.

Josepth Block has told me that he was unable to replicate the issue. After searching through bugs and previous cases, he found that this issue has come up a few times in the past and was always related to a localization issue with localized versions of Vectorworks.

I tried updating/rendering all VP&#39;s and after about 45 minutes I clicked back on VW and it crashed<br/>

The file is not very large and although there are not a lot of objects in the case, it does not want to finish rendering.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Before the student asked me to look at the file she had already converted objects to Generic Solids but she said it was happening before she did that as well<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have also tried to render just one of the VP&#39;s and I get a render progress bar but after about 10 minutes the progress stays in the same place<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do not have a crash log as the program just seems to be rendering but nothing happens so I have to force it to shut down<br/>

I am on Windows 10 and my student is on OS10 - she is on SP2 so that is what I listed below but I tested on Beta SP3 to the same result

                Erroneous &quot;Layer Plane&quot; as current plane in Orthographic Views 
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Without getting into any discussion about the poor nomenclature and implementation of planes, there has been an ongoing bug in 2021 which causes the current plane dropdown to say &quot;Layer Plane&quot; when in orthographic views, which should not be possible since the Layer Plane is perpendicular to these views. In orthographic views it should say &quot;Screen Aligned Plane&quot; (and usually does except for when this bug happens). When this bug occurs, 2D Objects are indeed drawn correctly as if the dropdown were set to &quot;Screen Aligned Plane&quot; - it&#39;s just that the dropdown erroneously says Layer Plane.<br/>
<br/>
Here are steps to produce this bug:<br/>
<br/>
-Start new file.<br/>
<br/>
-Go to Front view.<br/>
<br/>
-Make sure current plane dropdown is set to Screen Aligned Plane.<br/>
<br/>
-Hit 4, draw Rectangle.<br/>
<br/>
-Hit Cmd+E to Extrude, click OK.<br/>
<br/>
-Hold down control+MMB to flyover in 3D (my settings keep me in orthogonal wireframe). This causes current plane dropdown to say Layer Plane (as expected).<br/>
<br/>
-Go to Front view again. The current plane dropdown still says Layer Plane. This is where it&#39;s now wrong. It should again say &quot;Screen Aligned Plane&quot; like it did when you first went to Front view.<br/>

 <br/>

This is causing an issue as in this instance elevation benchmarks need to be placed in on the design layer.  When creating a viewport of this, the text can become unreadable due to how pixilated it becomes (even after increasing the sheet layer DPI)<br/>

Please can you confirm whether or not this is working as intended.

They act the same for a string with two successive embedded single quotes (xyz&#39;&#39;bc) but act differently if string has only a single embedded quote (abc&#39;bc). Also, the one in CriteriaInterpreter uses GetAt (I think that change was made with Unicode task).<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of consolidating the two functions but then I saw they were slightly different.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached snaps of the two methods with the line that differs highlighted.<br/>
<br/>
I made copies of the functions and wrote some test code to demonstrate, this is what I saw:<br/>
orig: xy&#39;z,  critInterp: xy&#39;z, critDlg: xyz<br/>

<br/>
The dialog, TComboDialog, excludes some node types via a logical check from being listed for the criteria categories, Name and Location in the Criteria dialog. See TCriteriaDialog::IsExcludedNodeType. See screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
Dialog code needs to be rewritten to correctly list those object types that are valid for both the Name and Location criteria functions.<br/>
 # Open the test file.<br/>
 # RIght click on the row 5 cell header and select &quot;Edit Criteria...&quot; from the context menu.<br/>
 # In the displayed Criteria dialog, note that in the row 2, 4th column text edit control the name of a tile resource, Tile-1, is entered.<br/>
 # Click on the 5th column icon to display the Object Criteria dialog.<br/>
 # NOTE: in the displayed Object Criteria dialog, the tile resources name is not listed even though it is a valid argument for the Name criteria function.<br/>
 # NOTE: this is not a regression. This has been the existing behavior for many versions.

Selecting all objects and then using the rotate tool rotates only the lighting devices. The pipe does not rotate correctly.<br/>

For lighting devices that are &#39;paired&#39; and have the same channel identifier it is possible to associate them as a pair by using the ganging tool. However, It is not possible to do this through a schematic view. In the attached image the lights above are ganged where the schematic view will not allow the user to use the ganging tool to do this via a schematic view.

They were not selectable as they were still in the symbol, so I had to enter into the symbol to delete them.

<br/>
1) Create a Rectangle.<br/>
2) Select the rectangle and select AEC&gt;Floor.<br/>
3) Enter 100 for &quot;Height&quot; and &quot;Thickness&quot; in the Create Floor setting dialog.<br/>
4) Go to View&gt; Create Viewport.<br/>
5) Select &quot;New Sheet Layer&quot; from &quot;Create Layer&quot; and select &quot;OpenGL&quot; from &quot;Rendering&quot;.<br/>
6) Select &quot;Right Isometric&quot; from &quot;View&quot; and close the Create Viewport dialog with OK.<br/>
7) Moved to the created sheet layer. Select &quot;Viewport&quot; and click &quot;Classes&quot; button on OIP.<br/>
8) Select the class of the floor object (&quot;None&quot;) and click &quot;Edit&quot;.<br/>
9) Click the Textures tab in the Edit Class(es) dialog.<br/>
10) Check on &quot;Texture&quot; and select any texture from the pull-down.<br/>
11) Close all dialogs with &quot;OK&quot;.<br/>
12) Click &quot;Update&quot; of OIP.<br/>
13) The selected texture is reflected on the sides of the floor, but not on the top.<br/>
<br/>
* * For floors created by ungrouping slabs, the texture will be reflected on the top surface if the same procedure is followed.<br/>
<br/>
* If you create a viewport on the sheet layer after assigning textures to the floor class in advance in the design layer, the texture will be reflected on the top of the floor.<br/>

                Spotlight Distributor tool auto numbering bug
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When using the distributor tool to insert a distributor object that has been stored in an active file, turning on auto numbering causes the tool to forget the symbol at insertion, instead a bounding box with label is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
create a new file and import a distributor symbol into the file resources,<br/>
<br/>
activate the distributor tool<br/>
<br/>
in the distributor symbol drop down choose the distributor in the active open file, not from the default library<br/>
<br/>
toggle the auto numbering on<br/>
<br/>
set the auto numbering preferences (making sure to tick the name field)<br/>
<br/>
as soon as you exit configuring the auto numbering the tool loses resets the Distributor symbol drop down in the tool mode bar to &#39;Select a distributor symbol&#39; and instead of inserting the originally chosen symbol a 2D rectangle is inserted with a label<br/>
<br/>
the rectangle registers as a distributor object in the OIP but losses most of its symbol defined configuration data such as output count, output connectors, etc...<br/>
<br/>
If you instead, re-select the distributor object after configuring the auto numbering the distributor object will correctly insert<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a video showing the issue<br/>

In the enclosed file and movie you will see a Hoist with both and ID label and a Measurement Label.<br/>
<br/>
The ID label&#39;s size can be changed simply by going to the Text menu&gt;Size. The Measurement label is unaffected by this. Even if placed into it&#39;s own class the label is unaffected by any class settings. This goes against a lot of Vectorworks usual workings, and appears hard coded and unable to be changed by users.<br/>

                Issue when changing Mesh Smoothing to None

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      There seems to be an issue with Mesh objects, where switching the Mesh Smoothing in the Render tab from &quot;Use Document Preference&quot; to &quot;None&quot; has no effect.  You have to first switch to &quot;Custom Crease Angle&quot; then to &quot;None&quot; for it to take affect.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
• Draw 3D Sphere.<br/>
• Modify &gt; Convert &gt; Convert to Mesh.<br/>
• The new sphere-like Mesh takes on the Document Preference smoothing (which I have turned on); this is indicated in the Render tab, and the Mesh looks smooth.<br/>
• Switch the smoothing dropdown to None. The Mesh still appears smooth. (In fact if you deselect and reselect the object, it&#39;s still set to &quot;Use Document Preference.&quot;)<br/>
• Switch the dropdown to Custom Crease Angle then back to None. Now the Mesh appears with hard edges as expected.<br/>
<br/>
This bug seems to only occur with Mesh objects that&#39;ve been created by me (as opposed to something imported from SketchUp for example). If I were to import something from SketchUp I can switch the Smoothing setting and it works as expected. However, if I take two imported meshes and combine them by selecting both and doing Convert to Mesh, then the issue occurs since that object is technically a new Mesh created in this document. <br/>

It seems to be related to the render engine saying that render is done.<br/>

But while moving a control point like this, the render should &quot;wait&quot; for the change from the user to be finished before rendering again....<br/>

The Check Box Three State control changes its state the the user presses, but its DDX data is updated when the user releases the mouse button *while the control is hovered*. This causes issues when the user presses on the control, moves the cursor away from the control and then releases the mouse.<br/>

For example this can be reproduced in the Title Block Border Settings Dialog:<br/>
Create a TBB, open the settings dialog from the Shape Pane, open the Drawing Stamp pane; Toggling the check box there should enable/disable the controls below<br/>

                [Mac Only] Floating windows show gray selection highlights instead of blue

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is an issue that appears wherever we are using standard system highlight behaviors for selected-item highlighting in containers like outline views, table views, and selection views.<br/>
<br/>
Normally an active window shows selected item with a blue (or settings-defined) highlight color, and when the window becomes inactive this changes to gray.<br/>
<br/>
Our floating windows are almost never considered active key-windows, so the highlighting of items in table and collection views are always gray. However if you can make a floating window key (e.g. by using an edit field in a floating OIP window) you can see that the highlighting in tables (e.g. texture browser) will change the blue.<br/>
<br/>
This can be seen in the floating Resource Manager window as well.<br/>

&quot;Shaded Polygon&quot; requires a vast amount of memory. Try to use Shaded Polygon for any Medium oder Big Sized 3D-Model and you will see, that Vectorworks is getting slow. And it&#39;s not really possible to go on with the work fluently after updating a viewport with &quot;Shaded Polygon&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view this render option with this amount of memory should no longer be a part of Vectorworks. In my opinion, customers who choose this render option will be 100% frustrated.<br/>

Then choose OK to close the dialog and when the DXF/DWG Import Options dialog opens, check, that the dynamic text for proposed units is set to &quot;&lt;Multiple files with different units&gt;&quot; and corresponding popup for unitless files is empty - this is the correct behavior.

<br/>
 - It ships a lot of the &quot;debug&quot; Qt DLLs (*d.dll and everything in QtPlugins/plugins/qmltooling), which makes the download and install a few hundred MB larger than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
- There are a lot of MSVC DLLs in the application folders, especially &quot;Vectorworks Cloud Services&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Putting them in the application directory only ensures they will become security problems as Windows Update will not be able to keep them updated.<br/>
<br/>
The installer should simply run the redist installer, as that way Windows Update can apply security fixes.<br/>
<br/>
(It also makes the install go faster, takes up less space on the customer hard drive and also ensures the install actually works for everyone. The new layout of MSVC redists since MSVC 2015 has made it pretty much impossible to figure out which DLLs are required.) <br/>

Some of the areas are loosing the fill and some are moving around when exported, especially if they’re using the ‘Export as ACIS solids’. If they’re using ‘triangulate to preserve fills’ then even more areas are loosing the fill.<br/>
They’ve tried all settings they can think of - do you have any suggestions? Attached are the screenshots from the files, the original VW file and the DWG export.

This is also reproducible for the Graphics pane, but it isn&#39;t for the Border Style field in the 2D Display pane. Probably because the Border Style field is more distanced from the Border style text.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have included a snap shot, video, and file.  The issue is with both the Hardscape tool set to Pathway as well as &#39;Create Objects from Shapes&#39; and selecting &#39;Hardscapes/Pathways&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hardscape Tool:<br/>
 * Select Hardscape Tool<br/>
 * In Tool Bar, select &#39;Pathway Configuration Mode&#39;<br/>
 * Using any of the listed Polyline modes will get the same results<br/>
 * Draw a CLOSED Polyline shape - notice the Hardscape Pathway does not completely close.<br/>
<br/>
Create Objects from Shapes:<br/>
 * Draw a closed Polyline using the Polyline Tool<br/>
 * With closed Polyline selected, right click and chose &#39;Create Objects from Shapes&#39;<br/>
 * In the Object Type dropdown, select &#39;Hardscape&#39;<br/>
 * Under &#39;Configuration&#39;, check &#39;Pathway&#39; (depending on size, set width to reasonable value - doesn&#39;t affect issue as far as I can tell)<br/>
 * After clicking &#39;Ok&#39; - notice the Hardscape Pathway does not completely close.<br/>

The hardscape&#39;s path has 2 consecutive corner vertices and 5 consecutive Bezier vertices. The corner segment is hidden (using the Reshape tool&#39;s &#39;Hide or Show Edges&#39; mode) so no border should be created along it. Notice that the border has issues in this case:<br/>

<br/>
It seems to happen because the neighboring segments are Bezier segment. After making (changing the type of) the corner segment&#39;s immediate neighboring Bezier vertices be Corner vertices, one of the problems is fixed, the other one remains:<br/>

                Marionette Pie Chart: Data Labels are not &quot;Outside&quot; when set as such
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The Marionette pie chart offers in its settings the option for the position of Data Labels to be either &quot;Inside&quot; or &quot;Outside&quot; - I assume &quot;of the pie or circle&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What really is outside is the top center point of the text object, which is not what I would expect as a user and it doesn&#39;t work out so well either, because the text objects can be hidden beneath a sector of the pie chart. (see screenshot and attached file &quot;Pie-chart-data-labels-outside.vwx&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I believe the &quot;outside&quot; position to be faulty right now and I propose an alternative, which would position the text object outside of its corresponding sector at any time.<br/>
<br/>
For the visual explanation please watch the attached video.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the text explanation:<br/>
There are two coordinates to consider:<br/>
1) The intersection of the angle bisector with the arc of the sector and adding an offset of 1/8 of the circle diameter. Let&#39;s call this point Poutside (Point outside)<br/>
2) The position of the text object (usually the center point). Let&#39;s call this point Ptext. <br/>
<br/>
The coordinates of Poutside are good, but not the current alignment with Ptext of the text object.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I propose the following two rules a) to avoid interferences with the pie chart and b) to position the text object really outside:<br/>
<br/>
Rule 1: when Poutside is left of the pie center point, the text object&#39;s right edge should be aligned with Poutside. If it&#39;s on the right, align the left egde.<br/>
Rule 2: when Poutside is above the pie center point, the text object&#39;s lower edge should be aligned with Poutside. If it&#39;s below, align the upper edge.<br/>
Rule 3: when Poutside is at the same x- or y-coordinates, align the text with the corresponding middle point.<br/>
<br/>
This way the text object can never interfere with the pie chart.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Originally this was happening in VW26.0.4, but only in this file, not a new document.<br/>
<br/>
Then I tested VW27.0.3b and it&#39;s still happening, but only in this file, not a new document.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
1) open file section-line-markers.vwx<br/>
--&gt; here the error has already occured, so we will start with the temporary fix/workaround.<br/>
2) Go to: Sheet Layer &quot;SCHNITT 1&quot;, select the SVP, in &quot;Section Line Instances...&quot; remove the SVP from all Viewports and confirm, readd the SVP to all VPs and confirm<br/>
3) Go to: Sheet Layer Grundriss Untergeschoss:<br/>
--&gt; the SVP marker is back where it belongs<br/>
Now to reproduce the bug:<br/>
4) Save and close the file<br/>
5) open the file<br/>
--&gt; You will see that the SVP marker has moved to a group of other SVP markers.<br/>
<br/>
Deleting the old SVPs and creating new ones did not solve the issue.

I put breakpoints in the notification handling and they seem to be hit, in particular in <br/>
<br/>
TViewportComparator::AtLeastOneBackgroundRenderingViewport()<br/>
<br/>
where it checks to return FALSE which should remove the &quot;Cancel Update&quot; button. If the breakpoint is HIT, then it seems to work, but if there&#39;s no breakpoint, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Scrolling on the OIP or clicking anywhere, EVEN ON OTHER APPLICATIONS (NOT VW) will make Windows refresh the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
This happens with RW and the new non-section backgrounded HL viewports.

See the screenshot attached. The action is Replace Selection, so the Field and Value fields should be hidden. If you switch to another action and back, they hide properly, so the issue applies to hiding not happening when the dialog initializes.<br/>

I did not test for all possible actions.

It&#39;s kind of silly to ask if the user knows about the shortcut they just used! The dialog should only come up with other methods of invoking the command (e.g. right-clicking and choosing Apply in the Resource Manager).<br/>

                Mac floating OIP steals main window keystrokes after text field edit
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Normally floating panels do not intercept keystrokes, so that all of our keyboard shortcuts work in the main window.<br/>
<br/>
After you edit a value with a text field in a floating OIP, it will become key window and keyboard shortcuts in the main window will no longer work, until you click on the main window.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a document with a simple shape<br/>
 # Make the OIP a floating window if it is not already (drag its title bar out of docked position)<br/>
 # Try some main window keyboard commands, e.g. &#39;4&#39; and &#39;x&#39; to switch between rectangle and selection tool<br/>
 # In the OIP, click to edit a text field on the Shape pane (such as shape size), then _click on an empty part of the OIP*_ to apply change and end text-editing<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: at this point you can type &#39;4&#39; and &#39;x&#39; to switch between rectangle and selection tool<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: keyboard commands are no longer delivered to the main window so nothing happens when you type those.<br/>
<br/>
*The issue does not occur if you hit return to complete text editing, rather than click on an empty part of the OIP<br/>
<br/>
WORKAROUND: either leave the OIP docked, or learn to always hit return to end editing, or always click on the main window after editing a text field in the floating OIP.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this pertains to some underlying Mac issues with floating panel configuration, key-window status, and NSEvent processing.<br/>
<br/>
Only tested under Big Sur 11.6 in VW2021 and VW2022, so far.<br/>
<br/>
This should also be tested with other panels that can float and have text-edit controls.

The clamp on the left is from the default content. The next are engineering drawings for Altman (fairly ubiquitous c. 2000), ETC, and a generic aluminum clamp, which is most similar to the one included in the content.<br/>
<br/>
The three actual clamps have fairly similar dimensions from the center of the pipe to the end of the stem. The default clamp, in contrast, is considerably smaller, and doesn&#39;t even quite fit around a standard 1-1/2&quot; schedule 40 pipe.

When offsetting a Lighting Accessory via the &quot;Edit Accessories&quot; mode, the label legend in 2D Plan view follows the lighting symbol without regard for the accessory offset. I believe this is the preferred behavior. When creating a schematic view of that hanging position, however, the label legend position does not account for the accessory offset. I would expect the schematic to follow the same rules as the model in 2D/Plan.<br/>

Is this WAD or should the label legend follow the placement when a schematic view is created?

A little bug by the definition of the attributes at the grade tool. If I steering the tool by class attributes it works with the assignments. But when I add text style to the class, the assignment for the background color is not changing. It needs first a refresh over the attribute-palette. <br/>
I attached my test file and also a movie to show you better the problem. <br/>

<br/>
You can see this for example in the Google Fonts downloads for Josefin Sans and Raleway. The downloads offer two &#39;Variable&#39; .ttf files to install, or you can instead install multiple .ttf files from the &#39;static&#39; subfolder.<br/>
<br/>
When you install the static, separate files, Vectorworks lists all of the font faces as you would expect, e.g. Josefin Bold, Josefin Thin, Josefin Medium Italic.<br/>
<br/>
If instead you install the variable .ttf files, Vectorworks lists &quot;Thin&quot; under all of the font faces. That is, Josefin Bold becomes Josefin Thin Bold, Josefin Medium Italic becomes Josefin Thin Medium Italic. The same happens with Raleway when you install the variable font.<br/>
<br/>
This does not occur in other applications, so it must be a Vectorworks issue.<br/>

<br/>
Reproduce steps:<br/>
 # Launch Vectorworks  with a new untitled document.<br/>
 # Create a Text object with default font, leave selected<br/>
 # Look at list of available fonts (check both OIP pull-down and main Text menu) - naturally you will not see the font you have downloaded but not yet installed.<br/>
 # Install the font in the local machine*<br/>
 # Again check the font list in the main Text menu or in the OIP with the text object selected<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the installed font shows up as available now<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: you have to quit and restart Vectorworks for the new font to show up<br/>
<br/>
*On Mac you can do this either using Font Book to preview and install the font, or simply by adding the font to the user ~/Library/Fonts folder.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably also an issue on Windows but only checked on Mac so far. Mac OS has a notification available to detect when available fonts change, so this would be not hard to implement. (Thinking to do it as part of PLAT-119 time permitting).<br/>
<br/>
Note, this is somewhat related to enhancement request VE-91304, though that is specifically about re-scanning for missing fonts during missing-fonts resolution on document open.

<br/>
To reproduce on Mac, you need to have some non-standard font installed in your ~/Library/Fonts folder.<br/>
 # Launch Vectorworks with new untitled document<br/>
 # Create a text object and set its font to a user-installed font<br/>
 # Uninstall/deactivate the font being used*<br/>
 # Create another text object; open the font menu (in OIP or in Text menu)<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the font that has been removed/deactivated is no longer in the fonts list; also, when font removal/deactivation is noticed an alert will be shown if fonts in use in open Vectorworks documents are no longer usable.<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the font removed is still in the list, and you can assign it to the new text object, but it will render incorrectly (see screenshot) as will the text object created at step 2.<br/>
<br/>
(Note however if you save the document and restart vectorworks and re-open it after re-installing/activating the font, the text objects will render correctly).<br/>
<br/>
* On Mac you can uninstall/deactivate using Font Book or by simply dragging the font out of the ~/Library/Fonts folder e.g. to the desktop.

</td>

In the enclosed file is a piece of truss on it&#39;s own layer and some conventionals on another. When the truss moves the instruments move with it. If users don&#39;t want them to move with the rigging for design purposes, then using the Modify&gt;Lock command should prevent that. Indeed the OIP is greyed out as expected but if the rigging movies the instruments still move.<br/>
<br/>
The workaround to disassociate them with the rigging is to set the Pick Radius to 0 in the Spotlight Prefs and select all the lights and use Edit&gt;Cut. If you then use Edit&gt;Paste in Place then they&#39;re back in the drawing and moving the truss does not affect the lights. <br/>
<br/>
The Lock command should prevent the Lighting Devices from moving like all other locked objects.<br/>
<br/>

                Spotlight + Renderworks: rendering of beams for Lighting devices unreliable
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
In the enclosed file there are some focussed lighting devices with a gobo in them. When I closed the file yesterday the beams were rendered. When I opened it today they are not. I have restarted the computer in between sessions.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see in the enclosed movie, using the new Spotlight&gt;Visualisation&gt;Set Spotlight Rendering Options the lit fog is checked. Yet now in Custom Renderworks or FQRW the beams do not render.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to the Visualisation palette and select all the lights and choose &#39;edit&#39; you can see that lit fog is turned on. If lit fog is turned off here, then if you go to the Set Spotlight Rendering Options command there the lit fog is still on. This should surely be off? <br/>
<br/>
Still the beams don&#39;t render. <br/>
<br/>
In the Set Spotlight Rendering Options command, if lit fog is turned off then on again, go back to the Visualisation Palette and edit the lights the lit fog option is rightly back on in the Properties window. <br/>
<br/>
I also note that a Renderworks background is generated each time a new lit fog option is checked. Surely it should use the existing or, rather than adding endless Renderworks backgrounds that will add to the file and make it very messy for the user. <br/>
<br/>
After I made the movie I repeated this and the beams appeared. I then reverted to saved, but the beams also rendered. It&#39;s as if the render was stuck in OpenGL (which it might have been). So this is why I label this unreliable as there is no rhyme or reason to why it fails.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>
<br/>
PS Tried to edit and strike through this: &quot;- if not then the user should be able to choose- &quot; but it didn&#39;t seem to work. You can of course choose the Renderworks background.<br/>

 * Click *Edit Bubble Layou*t from either the OIP of a selected grid line or from the *Grid line style* dialog box if editing the style. The bubble layout opens in object editing mode.<br/>
<br/>
The upper right corner shows the _Exit Bubble Layout_ square, which the user can click on after he&#39;s done editing the bubble layout. This text, _Exit Bubble Layout_, is made up from two concatenated strings, _Exit_ and _Bubble Layout_. These strings need to be resolved into a single string, _Exit bubble layout_, to avoid negatively impacting the localized versions of Vectorworks. See screenshot below for details.

When they would go to move multiple walls by using the move by points tool, the wall caps get set to none. You can go in and change it back, but if you try to move them like that again then the end caps reset to none again. Their file was somewhat cumbersome, but I was able to recreate the issue in a blank file of my own, so I have attached that file. In my file, if you try and move all of the walls using this tool, then the endcaps don&#39;t change. If you try and move all of the walls except for the top horizontal wall using that tool, then the endcaps change to none every time.

I found one light that had its wattage set at 6kW instead of 6,000w like the other lights.  If I changed this one light wattage to match the others then the summary would update to 69<br/>

Is this WAD?  Would a difference in wattage throw off the count?<br/>

How to reproduce the problem:<br/>

1. Select the Group in the attached vwx file.<br/>

2. Go to the Attributes Palette and try to change the Pen Style from Class Style to Line Type. It will not be possible.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to change, as example, from Class Style to None and then to Line Type, but never directly from Class Style to Pen Style.<br/>
<br/>
3. Ungroup the objects.<br/>
3.1. Select a Line and see that they are all Line Type.<br/>
3.2. Select a Text and see that they are Class Style and the ones responsible for this change to not take place. <br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to switch the Text directly from Class Style to Line Type, or a group that has the same text.<br/>

====ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION======<br/>
<br/>
To create renderings in VW you must put in furniture. <br/>
<br/>
The only way to have good furniture is to download them. Sketchup warehouse is one of the very popular options.<br/>
<br/>
But these furniture items end up becoming very big mesh objects in VW. Making it very hard to oparate. <br/>
<br/>

possibly we can go backward to find origins of this file and how it went wrong.

<br/>
If all options for the viewport attributes (eyedropper tool) are active and I picked up the information from viewport A and transfer them to B. It changes also the camera perspective. Are the position &quot;other properties&quot; in the viewport attributes inactive,  the perspective aren&#39;t changing.<br/>
I think it isn&#39;t practically when the &quot;other properties&quot; are includes the camera perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I attached my test file and my steps.<br/>
<br/>
Thank&#39;s for testing.<br/>

Even if the toggle is used the projector has to be manually moved in a 3D view for the field to update,<br/>
 * changing the Projector Distance(straight) field will move the projector but the position field will not update.<br/>

I know this may be WAD right now, but it would be great if sooner rather than later we could utilize the addition of the light emitter to properly represent lighting fixtures like this one that are out there.<br/>

There are 27 lighting devices that keep being &quot;reselected&quot; but I have no idea why. Often I can&#39;t unselect them by clicking in a blank space, but eventually, I can unselect. With nothing selected in the OIP, activating clip club makes the entire drawing disappear, which I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s related or not. While changing views, turning on/off clip cube, those 27 lights keep being selected I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. I tried closing and reopening the file, and also closing and reopening the app and neither fixed the problem.

The user has a new M1 13&quot; MacBook Pro running OS 11.2.3. VW2021 SP2.1 unclickable in certain areas of the screen, notably in the lower right of the screen within the nav palette. For example, when trying to make two layers invisible, the cursor changes to a vertical arrow (see screenshot).<br/>

Thankfully I was recording the session and I caught it on video. (Attached)<br/>

The user will be updating Vectorworks to SP3 and Outlook if an update is pending and they will let me know if the issue persists.

<br/>
When a texture with the &quot;cast shadow&quot; setting is applied to a lighting instrument and an RW Background is used with &quot;receive shadows&quot; set for lit fog, the beam from the instrument is completely blocked from drawing.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, this is the intended behavior for this combination of settings, but it&#39;s not very intuitive (especially if the texture is applied indirectly through a Data Visualization). At least for me, it took a while to figure out exactly why this was happening. We might want to show some sort of alert in this situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a reduced version of the original bug file for this issue. To reproduce: switch render mode to &quot;Spotlight (veloce)&quot; and turn on the &quot;Luci chiare&quot; Data Visualization.

 # Can be verified further by creating a Schematic View for the Lighting Ladder<br/>
<br/>
In the video, I gave the Lighting Ladder a Position Name to show/verify the Lighting Devices were attached before converting to a Hanging Position.  Lighting Ladders don&#39;t have &#39;Select System Objects&#39; in OIP, like Truss, till it is converted into a Hanging Position.  Once converted to a Hanging Position, all but the top Lighting Device lose their Position Name.<br/>
<br/>
If a Lighting Ladder is converted to a Hanging Position before the Lighting Devices are attached, this is not an issue.

I wouldn&#39;t expect that message to show when in a Workspace that doesn&#39;t have the Lighting Device tool, especially since the tool doesn&#39;t get activated and the symbol is not inserted as a Lighting Device.<br/>

All I did was copy and paste the lights from another .vwx file, then I did a lot of Data Exchange back and forth with Lightwright, using Duplicate Array.<br/>
<br/>
Late in the process, I resized the Vectorworks drawing window to make room for some other things. To my surprise, the contents of the drawing stretched and compressed in response to the window resizing. I was in standard Top/View 2D, Unified off. I have no idea how this happened. Quitting Vectorworks and launching it again, everything was OK. Screen video is attached.

 File-&gt;Import PICT as Bitmap.<br/>

The Command &quot;Import PICT...&quot;<br/>

The only difference between the two method is a slight difference of the <br/>
 image file size.<br/>

So I&#39;m not sure why we have two commands in Vectorworks.<br/>

<br/>
In the Attributes palette, note that the End Marker menu graphic shows a line segment running through the entire width of the marker (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t match the appearance of the actual marker so ideally that line would appear shorter.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021 the graphic didn&#39;t show a line at all so this wasn&#39;t an issue (see second screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 10 the menu graphic shows a line that runs halfway through the marker (see third screenshot). This shows regardless of whether the marker is filled or unfilled.

 <br/>
<br/>
The test file has an orbital path. Create a movie from the orbital path via the OIP by selecting &#39;Final Quality Renderworks&#39; mode with a duration of 5 secs. The movie takes a log time for the 100 frames, but if you click the &#39;Cancel&#39; button to stop it, this doesn&#39;t work too well. It appears that VW would let the render frame render all the way to 100%, which could take minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The other issue is that if you hide the &quot;Cancel&quot; dialog somehow behind the other dialogs, then there is no way to get it back because the movie preview dialog doesn&#39;t move

<br/>
There are still a couple situations, where a dropdown menu will not show up completely even though there is enough space to show it.<br/>
<br/>
For reasons of continuity within the Mac version and across platforms this should be harmonized.<br/>
<br/>
These are the situations where I found this behaviour (even though it&#39;s not the same):<br/>
<br/>
1) Resource Manager:<br/>
When the RM is at the very top of the screen<br/>
and any of the resource types is selected:<br/>
* Hatches<br/>
* Images<br/>
. . .<br/>
* Tiles<br/>
* Wall Styles<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
2) Attribute Palette:<br/>
When the AP is at the very bottom of the screen<br/>
and any of the Attributes is selected:<br/>
* Line Thickness (BTW: there is NO hover tooltip compared to the others)<br/>
* Line Startpoint Style<br/>
* Line Endpoint Style<br/>
<br/>
... the drop down menu is not shown completely but scrollable.

<br/>
We have a user having activation issues where it&#39;s saying the license is being used on another machine. However this isn&#39;t the case. <br/>
<br/>
From the user information its conflicting with itself. <br/>
<br/>
The LAN Shutdown seems to be happening every 5 minutes so its hard for them to user Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
Please find attached the system dxdiag and also screenshots from the user information. <br/>
<br/>
Myself and Joe havent been able to resolve this one. <br/>
<br/>
Joe suggested trying the  “netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt” in the command prompt. No luck. <br/>
<br/>
Any help on how to identify what is happening or resolve this would be great. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the VW Preferences and, in the 3D tab, change the 3D Conversion Resolution to &quot;Very High&quot;<br/>
-Close the dialog and select the Extrude<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, note that the object highlighting and line geometry update to show the higher resolution as expected.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, note that the line geometry updates to show the higher resolution, but the object highlighting remains in its original state.<br/>
<br/>
This happens in 2022 SP0, SP1, and SP2.

Weirdly, the attachments that were in the latter half of the post were still attached in the editor.<br/>

This has happened once or twice before but I have no idea what circumstances cause it. Would having multiple tabs open to various forum topics affect it somehow? Working in Safari 14.1.2.

The Vectorworks file includes a link to a PDF that goes over the math to confirm this; it&#39;s on the link below and the page underneath that.<br/>

I&#39;m not entirely sure if his math is correct in this case, and how this is being calculated in Vectorworks is most likely correct. I just wanted to submit this in the event the user is correct, and it would be good to be able to fix this for future versions.<br/>
<br/>
This was submitted by Francois Laroche (francois.laroche4@videotron.ca), in case we need to reach out to him in the future.<br/>

Please keep me posted if I can be of any further assistance with this, and have a great day! :)

It‘s added a search field, the texture and map type are next to each other. Scale and Rotation can be adjusted via sliders and Reset default mapping is moved down. For the rectangle, a search field, texture, and map type have been added to the Render pane.<br/>

*BUG UPDATE*: As Hernan&#39;s comment mentions, the actual bug here is that after changing the story elevation and pressing &quot;OK&quot; in the Organization dialog, the active plane is changed from Screen Aligned to Layer Plane. Since the active plane is changed from Screen Aligned to Layer Plane, the ruler behavior is expected (i.e., Works as Designed).

<br/>
After the first click for setting placement, the second click should set the angle.  Using three different methods, I was unable to do that correctly.<br/>
 # Using the Green dashed guidelines.<br/>
 # Using &#39;Shift&#39; to hold an angle (Shift seems to break the guidelines)<br/>
 # Using &#39;Tab&#39; to set the angle value<br/>
<br/>
There is a work around by setting the angle value in the Object Info Palette after the Video Camera has been placed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note: After pressing &#39;Shift&#39; the Green dashed guideline is gone completely.<br/>

Video was made in Vectorworks 2021 SP3, but this appears the same in Mainline.

Would you please investigate whether it is a Vectorworks specification or a Bug?<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction procedure:<br/>
1. Since Windows is easier to understand, open the sample file &quot;12623.vwx&quot; on Windows.<br/>
2. Start the Export Image File menu, select &quot;Marquee&quot; in the Export Area and click the &quot;Draw Marquee&quot; button.<br/>
3. Snap to the Top Left of the Rectangle with the red line in the center of the drawing and click, then snap to Bottom Right and click. This will specify the range along the red frame.<br/>
4. Click the Save button to save the image file. Just in case, I also attached the saved file &quot;12623.jpg&quot;.<br/>
5. Open &quot;12623.jpg&quot; with the &quot;Paint&quot; application to zoom in on the edges of the image.<br/>
6. Some of the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the image will be slightly outside the red frame. Please also refer to the screen dump &quot;Reproduced.jpg&quot; that shows the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please refer to &quot;12623.mov&quot; for the operation according to the reproduction procedure.<br/>
* There seems to be a difference in the appearance of the image file depending on the OS, display resolution, and zoom of the drawing. The OS of &quot;12623.mov&quot; is Windows 10, and the screen resolution is 1920 x 1080. <br/>

                                            <td class="description">      When you use the &quot;Insert-&gt;Function...&quot; menu in a VW Worksheet, it opens a list browser dialog named &quot;Select Function&quot;. The window always opens with the &quot;Functions&quot; choice selected in the &quot;Select from:&quot; popup menu; and the &quot;&lt;All&gt;&quot; choice selected in the second popup menu. Additionally, all of the items in the left column are expanded in the hierarchical display.<br/>
<br/>
1) The entire state of the dialog should be remembered when the dialog is closed and that state should be reapplied for all dialog elements the next time the dialog is reopened.<br/>
<br/>
2) The popup menus should remember which choice the user selected last and reopen the dialog with those choices selected.<br/>
<br/>
3) The hierarchical display in the left column always opens with all categories expanded. The list may be long. If you spend the time to close all of the unwanted categories, they will re-expand the next time the Select Function dialog is opened, which defeats the utility of closing unwanted categories. <br/>
<br/>
4) Also, it would be quite helpful if there were two extra buttons added to the dialog to Expand and Close all hierarchical categories when they exist. This would greatly improve the navigation of the items in the longer lists.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To view the problem:<br/>
<br/>
1) Create a worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
2) Place the cursor in a cell.<br/>
<br/>
3) Go to worksheet menu Insert-&gt;Function...<br/>
<br/>
4) The &quot;Select Function&quot; dialog opens. Note the &quot;Functions&quot; choice is always presented in the first popup, and &quot;&lt;All&gt;&quot; is always presented in the second popup, and all hierarchical elements are expanded in the column &quot;Function/Field&quot;.<br/>

As this is not a frequently used feature, the priority of this enhancement is quite low. Modeling should be performed in a modeling program. Vision is merely a previz-renderer for VW.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Render in OpenGL<br/>
-Now go to the OpenGL Options and change the Detail level <br/>
<br/>
Note that this causes many of the objects to disappear in OpenGL. The result will vary each time you change the view.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this on OSX 10.15 or on Windows 10 so it might be a 10.14 issue (specs attached).<br/>

-Draw a line and a rectangle<br/>
-Select both objects and in the Object Info Palette, change the class, to the class you created moments ago<br/>

<br/>
This is an issue I have experienced a couple of times, but finally managed to &quot;campture&quot; it. <br/>
<br/>
After setting out elements in a drawing and placing them, I can open the drawing at a later point to find that elements have moved. If this starts, it keeps on going. I will move them back - they move again. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have also experienced this as a blitting issue - which can be resolved by zooming in and out. In this case its in a viewport. Updating does not solve the issue. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have attached the file with an issue and a screenshot of where to find it. In this case its an imported part of a DWG that moves. These lines are collected in a group.

Also, I don&#39;t know how to display the counter of the &quot;Denials&quot; parameter of Server Status on the License Server Administration interface. Please show me how to do that?（Attached screen shot : Denials.png)<br/>
I tried denying the license by the Exclude command, but the Denials parameter remained 0. <br/>

<br/>
Many versions ago, when you typed a value in object info and pressed return, the value would remain highlighted, making refining the value easy.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, this behavior changed, and pressing return causes Object Info to stay highlighted. So technically a regression :) <br/>
<br/>
I believe from the discussion the last time came up, this was due to an update to Object Info, and not implemented by design.

 <br/>
<br/>
During a call with a customer, we ran into some issues with the Photometer values. With the light displaying with default settings, it seems to be working as expected; however, if we adjusting the lamp rotation or change the field/beam angles, it begins giving unexpected results.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In my testing, it seems changing beam/field angles slightly still provides expected results, but at a certain point, it just starts reporting 0&#39;s everywhere?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do not know enough about calculating the photometer values to confirm what they are supposed to be reading, but I seem to be getting unexpected results in my testing so far.

Under Advanced Section Properties, if you choose to set the Line Style to &quot;Use Class&quot; it&#39;s also affecting the pens that are part of hatches, and therefore Surface Hatches. I would personally expect this setting to NOT affect Surface Hatches.<br/>

See attached photos, where blue diagonal lines are a hatch on the glass material that I&#39;d like to stay blue and thin.

<br/>
On Mac, after users clicking on a tool from a SOD palette (other palette disappear at this point), users are still able to press shortcut key to switch tool. This is currently not possible on Windows.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
 # Users trigger the SOD<br/>
 # Users expand the Standard View SOD<br/>
 # Users click on a Standard View from the SOD palette (other palette disappear)<br/>
 # +While the Standard View SOD is still active+, notice now on Mac, users can still press the numeric key to switch standard view. On Windows, this is not possible.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to make this possible on Windows to create a consistent experience across platform.

<br/>
Straight truss foreshortens the 2D geometry with a hanging angle, so that the overall dimensions are correct, but the ends of the truss and far ladders and lacing are not correctly depicted. The exception is a hanging angle of 90. A roll stretches the object incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
Truss and Curved Truss just switch to 3D only, such that when the user needs to create a proper groundplan, they either need to convert any angled objects into auto-hybrids or cut up the viewport and apply different render modes to different portions of the ground plan.<br/>
<br/>
The disparate behavior also makes the concept of rigging object harder to grasp for users.

There are some simple dormers (not using any PIOs, just 3D geometry) - they&#39;re not aligned on the north and south walls, so I&#39;m using jogged sections for the viewports in order to cut through the middle of the respective windows.<br/>
<br/>
However, this is causing extra horizontal lines to appear on the angled surfaces which are the underside of the dormer ceilings. I&#39;ve indicated the extra lines with red arrows. These lines happen to be exactly where the initial segment of each jogged section would intersect (which I&#39;ve indicated with the dashed red line in plan). But these lines should not appear like that. And I can&#39;t figure out how to get rid of them.

Note that it renders as black.<br/>
<br/>
If you update it a second time, it then renders correctly.<br/>

This only seems to happen when the viewport&#39;s updated before a redraw is done. So if you open the file and zoom/pan before updating, you won&#39;t see the problem.<br/>

Also note on the polyline that I can&#39;t add a dimension at the mid-point of that arc which is annoying.<br/>

Lastly, the red error message in the lower right is misleading, since it says &quot;Diametrical dimensions can only be on circles.&quot; This is false, since they also work on Arcs and Polylines (when clicking in the right spot). Additionally, this error message says &#39;diametrical&#39; dimensions even when using radial dimension mode.

&quot;Creating a reference to a Vectorworks file in this manner allows you to reference resources from that file via the resource manager&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t. There is no place in the resource manager where I can browse referenced files. I can navigate to the referenced file from the resource manager in the same way as I can navigate to any file.

<br/>
but in the video, you&#39;ll see that mirroring two brand new focus points across the CL takes  a full 39 seconds. Is that to be expected? While working in this file, I have found doing things such as selecting, deselecting, moving, mirroring, distributing, and aligning focus points all take a long time and really slow down the workflow. In the second video, you&#39;ll see just selecting a focus point(s), there is a very noticeable pause while my crosshairs catch up to my cursor. Same issues after moving FPs. Should it be behaving like that? You can turn on other classes labeled Focus Points to play around and see if you experience the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
This is my first file using Focus points and I&#39;ve been disappointed in how sluggish they are. Not sure if that is fixable or not. Since using focus points is one of the primary ways of getting conventional focuses into Eos Augmented, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only person who will be using these more. I wish didn&#39;t slow down my work so much.

<br/>
When recalculating this worksheet, VW starts calculating and doesn&#39;t stop while the RAM usage gets out of control. Sometimes it rises up to around 24GB and stays there and sometimes it gets much higher. In my current test it&#39;s sitting at around 46GB. If I try to access Vectorworks, I only get the beach ball (MacOS). 30 minutes later Vectorworks is still recalculating and the RAM usage doesn&#39;t change anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If instead of recalculating the worksheet immediately I delete &quot;=IMAGE&quot; from the function cell, the worksheet recalculates in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The odd thing though is: there is another worksheet in this document (albeit with a different object list) &quot;TAB - FENSTER&quot; that uses the IMAGE function and it works fine and it also shows the window images. &quot;Fensterliste ALa&quot; is a worksheet in which I recreated &quot;TAB - FENSTERLISTE&quot; a few columns at a time. This new worksheet not only doesn&#39;t get stuck when being recalculated, but also shows an image of the windows.<br/>
<br/>
Using 27.0.1 B1 (599272) recalculation takes about 1-2 minutes (and the worksheet still doesn&#39;t show any images). I think this still takes too long, but overall in this case a lot better than blocking Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this and see if it&#39;s something that could be fixed for SP4 or SP5.

<br/>
VWX version used: Vectorworks 2021 SP2 R1 (Build 574483) (64-Bit)<br/>
OS: Win 10<br/>
CPU: Intel Core i7-5930K @ 3.50GHz, 6 cores<br/>
RAM: 16GB<br/>
GPU: 2x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980<br/>
Hard drive: SSD (system - with 25GB free memory)<br/>
<br/>
File contains 6 construction levels. Construction plane-1 contains 133, construction plane-2 133 and construction plane-3 134 individual 2D symbols (colored squares). Total 400 symbols.<br/>
Construction Plane-4, Construction Plane-5 and Construction Plane-6 each contain 5 copies of the same 30 individual 2D symbols. Total 450 symbols. The file also contains a database (dummy record) with 1000 database fields (Int with default 0). The 2D symbols are linked to the database and contain three entries per symbol. (In each case Int 1 instead of 0).<br/>
<br/>
Problem 1:<br/>
Selecting the 133 2D symbols in e.g. construction level 1 takes about 10 seconds! (Time until OIP update).<br/>
During the selection process, the CPU load increases from 0% to 10% (VWX App) or 1% to 3% (system-wide).<br/>
When VWX is in operation, the memory is permanently around 694MB (VWX app) or 6.8GB (system-wide) and does not increase when selected. Other running processes are Google Chrome, MS Excel, MS Notepad, MS Task Manager, other system processes.<br/>
Question: Why doesn&#39;t VWX make use of the abundant free hardware resources to speed up the selection process? 10 seconds waiting time to select 133 2D symbols while the CPU is at 3% total load is annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2:<br/>
The file contains a script called &quot;KA_Import_WS&quot;. This imports a worksheet (dummy record table) that is already in the file from the source file &quot;WS_Source_File_v2021.vwx&quot; and configures the filter lines of the table to the levels specified by the user selected in the GUI. The table is then recalculated. (vs RecalculateWS () - line 103). The script then prepares the table data for transfer to the OS clipboard. The script measures the time of the individual steps of the script execution and shows this after completion of the script (AlrtDialog). The table recalculation process takes a very long time, which is not really surprising due to the size of the table and the number of symbols, but on the one hand the duration of the recalculation varies from 54 seconds to 104 seconds and on the other hand, the free hardware remains of the computer in deep sleep. (Example execution of the script for construction level -1 to -3 // 400 symbols)<br/>
Question: Is the spreadsheet process to be speeded up and why does the duration vary? And as with question 1, why doesn&#39;t VWX use free hardware to speed up the process?<br/>
<br/>
To configure the script:<br/>
Enter the local path to the source file in line 278. (I upload with)<br/>
<br/>
You can ignore the remaining tables and scripts in the file.

This might be an issue on our side, but we have no idea if or what we did wrong in our plug-in.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we don&#39;t see everything that happens in VW, we don&#39;t know why several functions in VW are triggered several times and why they do take so long between calls. We don&#39;t know if this is something we did wrong in our plug-in, or if this is something in VW.<br/>
<br/>

The issues are:<br/>
 # Why is IProviderShapePane::Active() called 3 times?<br/>
 # Why does an object (C) that is in a wall that&#39;s not directly attached to walls with corner windows in it, causing those corner windows (A+B) to be recalculated?<br/>
 # Why doesn&#39;t point 2 happen in that stripped down file?<br/>
 # Why does it take so long between a Recalculate() and the next Recalculate() or Active()?

In the enclosed zIp file there are two files, both identical with one exported to v2021.<br/>
<br/>
If you File&gt;Export&gt;Export MVR both versions use up a huge amount of memory. This report is to say that v2022 uses considerably more memory and takes longer to export than v2021 hence this is a regression.<br/>
<br/>
2021 = 58.52GB<br/>
2022 = 90.97GB<br/>
<br/>
I have advised the user to swap out the trusses he is using as I suspect they are one element of why it takes 30 mins plus to export but nevertheless there is a difference in memory and time with v2022 compared to v2021.<br/>

`Delete called on &#39;DMX::DMXProvider&#39; that is abstract but has non-virtual destructor [clang: -Wdelete-abstract-non-virtual-dtor]`<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, because the purely virtual class had a non-virtual destructor, every call to free memory for any given DMXProvider would not free the appropriate amount of memory causing a leak.<br/>
<br/>
Because this issue was introduced in 260x at CL # 571694, this is a regression. The issue is still present in 270x and mainline.

<br/>
The only time editing a cable style should force a parts recalculation is if the cable type or connector fields are changed.<br/>
<br/>
It should not recalculate if of the other settings are changed as they have nothing to do with the cable parts used by any cable objects using the style<br/>
<br/>
Ideally even if the connectors and type gets changed there should be some sort of warning dialogue or option to not change the existing part configuration<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce<br/>
<br/>
draw a cable using any style<br/>
<br/>
hit the cable configuration button and had a couple of parts to it<br/>
<br/>
edit the style the cable uses, doesn&#39;t matter what is changed<br/>
<br/>
re select the cable object and look in the cable configuration, it will have recalculated the parts from scratch<br/>

<br/>
The `m_needs_lightmap_update` boolean should only be set to true when something in the light train has changed and a new lightmap needs to be generated in the LightMaskFactory class. This is because generating new lightmaps is expensive and doing so unnecessarily causes framerate issues in Vision.<br/>
<br/>
GDTFs appear to be setting the `m_needs_lightmap_update` to true every time that `DMXControlledObject::Update` is called. This happens inside of the `GDTFControlledObject::OnBeforeUpdateGdtf` method.

We have confirmed the following problem compared to VW2020.<br/>
I think performance will improve if the following problem is resolved.<br/>
Also, I think that the preview function of the new feature of VW2021 depends on the performance of the PC to display many objects, but I think that should be considered separately from this problem. <br/>
<br/>
About the problem of VW2021:<br/>
When moving many objects with Move by Points Tool, the move process takes longer than older versions such as VW2020.<br/>
<br/>
Reproducibility procedure:<br/>
1) Open the sample file &quot;12546_v2021.vwx&quot;. Many objects are in the selected state.<br/>
2) Select the Move mode of Move by Points Tool.<br/>
3) Click the start point position and move the mouse cursor to the end point position to display a preview of multiple objects. * This preview is a new feature of VW2021<br/>
4) Wait for the preview display process to complete. So far, no problems have occurred yet.<br/>
5) Clicking at the end point will start the move process, but it will take longer to complete the move process than before VW2020. This is the problem. <br/>
<br/>
Please refer to the video &quot;12546_v2021.mp4&quot; of the problem that occurs in VW2021 and the video &quot;12546_v2020.mp4&quot; that does not occurs the problem in VW2020.<br/>
The sample files &quot;12546_v2021.vwx&quot; and &quot;12546_v2020.vwx&quot; used are also attached. <br/>

This auto hybrid took over 3 hours to generate initially, and almost any modification of it takes almost as long (changing the cut plane, or applying a class to it). <br/>
<br/>
While processing the auto hybrid memory use increased to a peak of 120 - 130 GB (the laptop has 64 GB RAM) and then gradually declines until the process is finished. In some cases the Mac locks up with a warning that the computer is out of system memory and I have to force restart.<br/>
<br/>
There are many extrudes in this object, but Vectorworks should be able to handle objects of this complexity.

I retested to update an viewport with IFC objects in VW2021.The Viewport is extrem slowly to update as OpenGL. I tried to reduce the meshes from the IFC object but without an improvement to the updatetime. After an hour I had canceled the update.<br/>
Sadly I haven&#39;t the original import file as .ifc. I hope the file is useful anyway. <br/>

Thank you for testing.<br/>

Same file on PC has no slow down at all with accelerate graphics active so this may be isolated to Mac only?

                This file has very slow screen redraw times in last four VW versions
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The attached VW file has very slow screen redraw times for VW 2019, 2020, &amp; 2022. It fails to open completely in VW 2021, and just hangs before refreshing the screen.<br/>
<br/>
The file is saved in VW 2015 format to allow it to be opened in all newer releases. There are three design layers each with an array of 2D symbols (qty 588). Each layer contains a different symbol name. <br/>
<br/>
From VW 2019 to the present, it can take from 12 to 40 seconds to switch layers when viewing everything in the design layer. Zooming and scrolling is also affected but not to the same degree as changing layers.<br/>
<br/>
See attached Excel file with times listed in seconds for each operation in each version of VW, except VW 2021, where the file failed to open completely. Typically I&#39;d kill the application after 1-2 minutes of waiting, but I once waited over 7 minutes before aborting.<br/>
<br/>
There were many VW crashes in this exercise, even after rebooting the computer to see if that would stabilize things. It did not. I am attaching three crash logs that occurred during my testing. The last word in each file name shows what I was doing when each crash occurred. VW 2022 crashed twice today while switching layers, but did not generate a crash log either time.<br/>
<br/>
The number of symbols on one layer is small compared to some files I have worked on in the last few years. Symbol counts can easily exceed 3,000 per layer with 5-10 layers being common. <br/>
<br/>
For this exercise, VW 2017 proved to be the quickest and the most stable. Usually, VW 2019-2021 has been able to edit my designs, but this file has caused all of the recent versions to fail, or crawl so as to be effectively useless. I am not sure if my recent OS upgrade to OS 10.15.6 in July is a contributing factor.<br/>
<br/>
Please note, VW 2015 &amp; 2017 have nearly instantaneous screen redraws for a file of this complexity, and I consider this to be a relatively simple file. This is the screen refresh performance I expect all of the time.

Enclosed is a v2021 file called &#39;Damien Cooper - State LX Plan&#39; and it has a file called &#39;Damien Cooper - STATE vector ref&#39; that is referenced into it.<br/>
<br/>
These files have also been exported to v2020.<br/>
<br/>
When the main file is open there is an Instrument Summary. Click on that and it takes a few and acceptable seconds to calculate. However in the v2020 file it is almost instantaneous.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this has been dealt with in:<br/>
Vectorworks BugsVB-177625<br/>
Spotlight Instrument Summary Build list takes forever in SP3 but only in this file.<br/>
<br/>
However this report shows a direct comparison between versions, as I have some users who are complaining and thought this comparison useful.<br/>

<br/>
The issue, imo, is that anytime an item is selected we walk all verts and calculate the min/max. This allows us to draw the selection box.<br/>
<br/>
We should try to work towards caching this information so that selections are snappier.<br/>
<br/>
We can probably do something similar to what we did for object transformations. We can simply dirty the min/max cache for selection box and recalculate whenever it is requested and necessary. When not dirty, a request will simply return the cached value.

From Rob Hollis:<br/>
<br/>
The customer has a 2022 trial version and complained that there is “unbelievable” lag in zooming in and out in 2022 vs 2021. He was using an M1 Mac Mini. On a Macbook Pro, I did notice a slight difference in the zoom speed in 2022 vs 2021 but nothing “unbelievable”. Would you be able to please assist Ish and me by looking into this for the customer? Thank you very much.<br/>

Customer notes:<br/>
<br/>
Below is his response.  I’ve asked again for the referenced files.<br/>
 “I looked to update Vectorworks 2022, but it said it was up to date.<br/>
 The Mac Mini M1 has 16 GB of RAM. <br/>
 There might have been couple of other programs running such as Mail and Safari, but that was true for both VW 2021 and VW 2022. <br/>
 At the time I was running both Vectorworks at the same time to compare them.”

You can see that their Text objects are quite complex and very lengthy. Trying to add characters to any of their existing Text objects is very delayed. This seems to get worse as the Text Objects become longer/have more characters. I am also able to replicate this in a new file by continually adding characters to one Text Object until it starts getting delayed. Breaking the Text Objects into smaller sections seems to help, but it is not ideal for their workflow. I have tried all different Navigation Graphics settings and Vectorworks Preferences, but the result is the same.

A bit more context: the file size doubling has existed since the tool was introduced in v2021. However, the file/computer slowing down to a crawl is new to v2022.

In this case a Vectorworks user is affected that switched form AutoCAD to Vectorworks. Creating, Moving or deleting objects can take several seconds. We know the file has a lot of objects but it seems that all objects are always calculated although they are invisible.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Watch the attached movie<br/>
 # Open &quot;Testfile 20210308_01&quot;<br/>
 # Move an object<br/>
 # Delete an object<br/>
 # Create a new rectangle<br/>
<br/>
The problem occurs on Mac and on Windows . But on Windows it is even slower. We already reported several similar issues.<br/>
<br/>
VB-157268<br/>
<br/>
VB-168056<br/>
<br/>
VB-166974<br/>
<br/>
We compared the speed with AutoCAD and ArchiCAD and there is close to no delay when creating, moving and deleting objects. Therefore we hope that you find a way to optimize the performance too. Our guess is that invisible classes and/or layers are always calculated and this slows down these processes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I log this as high because it is a performance issue and offen our key customers are often affected.

Maybe there would be a some ways to improve this because many of our interior-designers working with such &quot;imported&quot; geometries. That would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Performance issues, normaly we are rating high, but in this case i am not sure, if this is an issue by nature of CAD. I tested in 2020 and 2022. The issue in 2022 is the same.

<br/>
Originally the Delay was 50 Minutes and the project was on 2019. I think we have a workaround for the customer. But It would help us if you could take a look at the situation and could tell, why with the same informations once it takes 6 Minutes and the second time it takes 2 Minutes.<br/>
<br/>
The Situation was reported from a big costmer (50+ Lic.) wo we need to produce detailed informations and also the reference-Speed is a continous burner for issues and takes a lot of time to give transparent feedback to customers so i rated by high. I think 6 Minutes in an isolated case are not a blocker but often this produces other issues (Source Files (PS) are locked)<br/>

1. Open the file. Select Sheet Layer: A1 and Update the Section Viewports (they have different settings)<br/>

<br/>
here in Germany we are facing a growing number of customers complaining about a slow text tool. Some customers suggest it has something to do with drop shadow, certain fonts, complex lines using text, a bigger number of geometry and text mixed in a document.<br/>
<br/>
Please see video and testfile. What I found out is, that text has a poor performance in bigger text fields. Reproducibility with bigger text fields is always, and with less big text fields sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Please increase the performance of the text tool.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards Klaus

                Default Hatches Causing Vectorworks to be Very Slow and Leads to Memory Hangs

<br/>
If you edit section in place on it, Vectorworks will begin to hang because it starts using over 30GB of RAM (I saw it climb to 50GB before I force quit it).<br/>
<br/>
After some testing, it seems to be linked to a default resource we have in our libraries. These hatches have over 1,000 layers in them. We shouldn’t have resources like this in our default content.<br/>
<br/>
I put together another test document that only had 20 walls and 7 slabs that used the materials that have this hatch applied, and while it wasn’t nearly as bad as this example document, editing section in place caused Vectorworks to use over 10GB of memory.

<br/>
Have quite a lot of problems with a file. It seems that section viewport that is on the screen when file is opened is very slow. Opening the section in place or design layer takes a lot of time. I think there is not much on the file for it to be so slow. The main problem that the user has a computer which is not the strongest machine which makes it even slower than i see on my machine. <br/>
<br/>
With the add of a memory leak, which by the way is on users machine as well when this file is opened it makes it very problematic to work.

<br/>
After uninstalling Vectorworks Site Protection that used the activation key, even if it was installed again on the same PC, the activation key that was used could no longer be used. * Occurred with macOS and WindowsOS.<br/>
<br/>
Version of Vectorworks Site Protection used:<br/>
 RLM software version: v14.1 (build: 3)<br/>
<br/>
Activation key used with macOS: AC1-GW7DJP-JA-BEAF46<br/>
macOS used: Big Sur version 11.4<br/>
<br/>
Activation key used with Windows OS: AC1-7LP667-JA-B05AE1<br/>
WindowsOS used: Windows 10<br/>
<br/>
Reproduced background:<br/>
1) I installed Vectorworks Site Protection and activated it with the Activation Key.<br/>
2) With Vectorworks Site Protection running, I also started the SG client and confirmed that I could connect to localhost.<br/>
3) Click the Vectorworks Site Protection menu&gt; Uninstall ... to open the Uninstall Vectorworks Site Protection dialog.<br/>
4) The option of &quot;Revoke Internet activated licenses&quot; / &quot;Delete license files, logs and settings&quot; was left with the default setting of On, and the Uninstall button was clicked.<br/>
5) After uninstalling, when I installed it again on the same PC, the same Activation Key could not be used. When I tried to use it, the following message was displayed. &quot;Activation failed, because the key is being used on another machine. Please revoke it first there and activate again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I tried to reproduce this phenomenon using a different activation key, but I could not reproduce it. Therefore, please note that this procedure does not always occur.<br/>
<br/>
In a similar report, VB-181906, it seems that the Bug fix is ​​done in RLM 14.1, but I think that such a problem may still occur.<br/>
<br/>
Please investigate the cause of this problem from the activation key you were using.<br/>
Also, I want you to be able to use this activation key again.

I am starting with something really simple, a vertical boom pipe and conventional units. I am waiting for content from VWX that makes a sidearm with a T and a C-Clamp a useful accessory. In 2D and 3D.<br/>
<br/>
In top/plan, I have created a 21&#39; pipe on the floor. Using the OIP, I rotated to vertical. I have given the pipe a position name. I have added units. I selected the position and gone to Spotlight?Visualization&gt;Create Schematic view. I selected the top option.<br/>
<br/>
What I expect is a view showing the pipe and the units using the top/plan 2D representation. What I have is a pipe laying over there, one unit near the pipe, another unit near the vertical pipe, and the model. <br/>
<br/>
Still no way to tell someone how to hang the pipe. I have purposely made this really simple. That&#39;s a first step.<br/>
<br/>
Should I select the pipe and the units? Is there some operator error here? Is this functionality not working yet in 2022? If this is WAD, where did the design/engineering go wrong?

<br/>
To be able to run bracework with tower, made like rigid corner (I know it&#39;s not mechanical correct...), I created towers with different Z attach.<br/>
<br/>
If I construct my tower symbol with L truss departure at z0, &quot;Select system object&quot; command works perfectly with the tower and the 4 attached trusses in 4 directions.<br/>
<br/>
If I construct my tower symbol with L truss departure at z6000 by example, &quot;Select system object&quot; command works only with the tower and 3 attached trusses, Right, Top2D, Bottom2D. The Left truss isn&#39;t selected by the command.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for Braceworks it is obligatory to always create L departure at z0 ?<br/>
<br/>
In my case, have the possibilty to have a different z for departure will be great, so base tower will be at z0 instead of z-6000 in this example.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution would be to have adjustable towers in height.<br/>

<br/>
When connecting a cable object to a lighting device the lighting device only get data pushed into its circuit name and circuit number fields if the cable is directly connected to a distributor object at the other end (and has a cable run ID) first. <br/>
<br/>
This prevents lighting devices from correctly documenting the circuit name and number in a number of common scenarios<br/>
 * using daisy chain mode- only the first light in the chain will have the circuit name and number.<br/>
 * single connection mode- often users want to connect cable to lights without using a breakout or distributor.<br/>
<br/>
The correct behavior from the users point of view is that whenever a cable is connected to a lighting device the lighting device documents the connecting in the circuit name and number fields

<br/>
[https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Windows-are-not-cutting-their-host-wall-in-a-specific-linked-IFC-file-in-Revit.html]<br/>
<br/>
IFC exported from Vectorworks opens as expected in Solibri and BIMVision, but when linked to Revit is not cutting openings in host Walls. The inserts are there and can be seen if Walls are hidden, but are buried inside them. <br/>
<br/>
When IFC is imported into Revit, it completely fails.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reporting this here as reference, I&#39;ve confirmed the issue has been resolved in Revit 2022. Bug can be immediately resolved.<br/>

The IFC-DataMapping is done by the &#39;Electrical Item&#39; . The DataMapping from CH-Pset-Datas are mapped by Datamanager. This Mapping does not work.<br/>
There are no CH_Pset_Datas attached to the &#39;ElectricalObject&#39;, and there is no IFC-Export. <br/>

Exactly these walls with a wall feature are somehow duplicated and positioned all together at the very same location, but somewhere outside of the original model, when exporting the model to IFC.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce (see video):<br/>
1) open file wall-with-recess-ifc-export-bug.vwx<br/>
2) export IFC<br/>
3) import IFC file in Solibri or BIMcollab ZOOM<br/>
--&gt; 5 walls are on top of each other<br/>
(re-importing the file in Vectorworks will not show these ghost walls)<br/>
4) delete some of the walls with a wall feature and repeate 2 and 3<br/>
--&gt; the deleted walls will show fewer duplicates<br/>
5) now just delete the wall feature from the last walls and repeate 2 and 3<br/>

Steps to reproduce (see video):<br/>
1) open attached vwx file<br/>
2) export IFC with &quot;Quantity Take Off&quot; and &quot;1st Level Space Boundaries&quot; enabled<br/>
3) import IFC into Solibri and switch the Model Tree to &quot;Component Hierarchy&quot;<br/>
4) select the door and window components to see all are positioned correctly<br/>
5) select the lower level space<br/>
6) select the tab Space Boundaries in the INFO area and click through the components to see that all are positioned correctly<br/>
7) repeate 6) with the upper level space selected and see that the door and the window space boundaries have a z offset - as if they were in the lower level.<br/>
<br/>
The video shows this in the German version of VW in 2021 SP 2.1.1, but I tested it using the US version 26.0.2 (580007) and got the same result.<br/>
<br/>
I also tried replacing the German doors and windows with US ones, but those don&#39;t show up for &quot;Space Boundaries&quot; tab in Solibri.

I attached an example and a test export. <br/>

As you can see only the ungrouped objects are exported.<br/>

I log this as medium. Actually it is a high for us because a big customer is affected and reported it.

If you use different classes for dimensions, the function &quot;Create Similar Object&quot; doesn&#39;t change the class settings in the document preferences and draw the next dimension in the class of the settings and not in the class of the clicked dimension.<br/>
<br/>
If a user would like to use &quot;Create Similar Object&quot; with dimension she/he must switch off the class option in the document preferences.<br/>

Dimensioning is a 2D object and we can switch the 2D objects on and off (they should be displayed in full). It should work for &quot;All Edges&quot; as well as &quot;Only Visible Edges&quot;. It is also displayed differently depending on the height.

<br/>
If the drawing has Constrained Linear Dimensions using the first, third and / or fourth methods, the Report will have only one &quot;Dimension&quot; Criteria.<br/>
<br/>
If the drawing has also a Constrained Linear Dimension with the second method, then it will be created a duplicated &quot;Dimension&quot; criteria.<br/>
<br/>
The second method in the German Version, we call it &quot;Kettenbemaßung&quot; and we differentiate it from the other methods. In the German Version point of view, we would expect to exist two criteria (one being &quot;Bemaßung&quot; which means Dimension and the other one for the second method being &quot;Kettenbemaßung&quot; which mean Chain Dimension).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if one Criteria for all Dimensions or a different Criteria for the second method, it shouldn&#39;t exist two Criteria with the same name.

Customers want to set the minimum required URLs and ports in the firewall&#39;s safe lists.<br/>
For example, if a URL or port is only used to download BIMObjects, customers who do not use BIMObjects will decide that they do not need to be set in the firewall&#39;s safe lists. <br/>
<br/>
Forum page:<br/>

<br/>
The following is an excerpt from the Forum page.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Firewalls:<br/>
These URLs should be added to any FireWalls safe lists:<br/>
<br/>
activation.vectorworks.net<br/>
connect.vectorworks.net<br/>
installer.vectorworks.net<br/>
notify.vectorworks.net<br/>
release.vectorworks.net<br/>
api.bimobject.com<br/>
api.vectorworks.net<br/>
sso.vectorworks.net<br/>
<br/>
These ports should be open on any filters / routers / firewalls:<br/>
 <br/>
Port 80 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 75 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 475 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 1045 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 1947 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 5053 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
Port 5054 (UDP and TCP)<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Customers want to know what features these URLs and ports are used in Vectorworks.<br/>
Also, if there are any Vectorworks that use URLs or ports other than the above, would you please give me that information as well?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the information we have so far grasped by asking questions and checking Vectorworks help is about the following three features.<br/>
<br/>
1) Export Web View (3D only)&gt; &quot;Upload To Vectorworks Server&quot; in Export WebView Options<br/>

    Port: 443 (TCP)<br/>
<br/>
3) Vectorworks Site Protection Server<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
When having multiple trusses below each other, with fixtures hanging, fixtures changes with different z height when mirroring the lx below to a different truss<br/>
<br/>
Example, when having 2 LX&#39;s below each other with truss, and mirroring the fixtures only to the mirrored trusses, the fixtures jumps to the highest LX.<br/>

[~ilane], [~tfapohunda] : this sort of thing keeps cropping up and creating problems. Is it time to change the limit? Or strategy?

1) Set the active class to none<br/>
2) Create new text object<br/>
3) Change its class to Text Class<br/>
4) Notice how the text is using Unstyled text style and has its fill not By Class resulting in a mixture of colors taken from the unused text style and from the class<br/>
5) Set all attributes of the text to be by class again<br/>
6) Notice that the text style is still Unstyled<br/>
7) Change the text style to &lt;Class Text Style&gt; or TextStyle-1<br/>
8) Notice how the text gets the colors of the text style and sets it fill attributes to be not by class<br/>
9) Notice that the pen attribute is set to be By Class and purple but actually the text style pen color is used - red<br/>

I think that we have problems with classes using text styles with different fill/pen colors. What should be the correct way for these to behave?<br/>

It is important for me to know as using classes with text styles is part of T02268 - ConnectCAD Classes. For example, we would like to set up a text object using a specific class and have all its attributes set to by class. The users will be able to set text styles for this class and we want them to correctly apply. What happens currently is that the text style&#39;s fill color overrides the class fill color and sets it not to be by class but the pen color remains by class and uses the class attributes.

User experiencing crashes when working with ODBC.<br/>
<br/>
Additional information from the user following Crash Report being linked to closing Vectorworks,<br/>
<br/>
_&quot;For info, I don’t believe it was the closing of the file which tripped it as previously it has crashed simply being open. Subsequent to the recording I reopened the file and left it open in the background while I was answering emails. Vectorworks crashed in the background about 5 minutes later without me activating the Vectorworks drawing window.&quot;__<br/>

When trying to start up 2022, it fails; even when the proxy file is implemented correctly.<br/>
It crashes before reaching the SSO Login dialog.<br/>
<br/>
The error message he receives says, ”attempt to reach the login server fails due to communication problems”.<br/>
Ports and server addresses you provided are already deposited.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to open sso.vectorworks.net by using the microsoft browser. This works pretty fine when proxy information are stored within the internet settings.<br/>
After turning off the Proxy-settings for the browser, sso.vectorworks.net can’t be reached anymore.<br/>
Then  we checked the VWProxy.txt and the same proxy-information are stored in this text file.<br/>
<br/>
It seems, that Vectorworks isn’t checking the VWProxy.txt when the Login dialog should start.<br/>
Therefore the message, the screenshot shows, appears.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible, that the login dialog is another web-window (chromium?) that doesn’t take a look into the proxy file?<br/>
What means, that the login is not able to start up and leads to the error message?<br/>

The user origin aligns 2D Objects direct in a 3D plane, when they are drew in in a 3D view. The object orientation should also on layer, when a user origin is active. Above all if the objects haven&#39;t an z value.<br/>

After I saved the file, the file size increased 101MB, to 822MB If I open that file, and execute a saved view, that switches to Top/Plan, and turns on all Layers/Classes, when I save the file, it jumps to 1.2GB. However, if I open the original file at 721MB, with no objects deleted, run the same Top/Plan saved view, save the file, it remains around 722MB with no file increase.<br/>
<br/>
-Download and unzip the following:<br/>
\\nemetschek.net\Files\Engineering\QA\FileTesting\JIRA-LargeBugFileDownloads\VB-176818<br/>
<br/>
-Open, &quot;File1.vwx&quot; This is the original file, without deleted objects<br/>
-Execute saved view, &quot;Wireframe - Top/Plan - All Layers and Classes&quot;<br/>
-Save the file with a different name and verify the file size<br/>
-Open, &quot;File2.vwx&quot;  This is the file were items were deleted and the size increased 101MB<br/>
-Execute saved view, &quot;Wireframe - Top/Plan - All Layers and Classes&quot;<br/>
-Save the file with a different name<br/>
-Now compare the size of both files and you&#39;ll find the second file is over 1GB<br/>
<br/>
In the course of deleting objects from the second file, something has happened, to cause a large increase in file size.   <br/>
<br/>
In my testing, I&#39;ve deleted objects from the first file and it drops down to 300+MB as expected.  Once saved view, &quot;Wireframe - Top/Plan - All Layers and Classes&quot; is executed, it&#39;s still in the neighborhood of 300+MB.  It&#39;s just once in awhile, deleting objects from File1.vwx, appears to corrupt the file in some manner and future saves could balloon the file size.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in VW 2021<br/>
-Edit the 3D Component of the symbol instance<br/>
-Select all the objects and drag them upward while holding down the SHIFT key to constrain the movement to the Z-axis.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the movement gets constrained as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now open the file in VW 2022 and try the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the movement fails to get constrained.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen when the symbol instance is rotated. It also seems to depend on which object is clicked-on to initiate the move operation.<br/>
<br/>
This happens in 2022 SP0, SP1, and SP2.

I have a customer who was trying to delete an object which was appearing in his viewport, however that object is not present on the design layer to be selected, We also did a report on &#39;extrude along path&#39; objects and it reported but again we were not able to see or select the object through the report. <br/>
<br/>
This happens on VW2018, 2019 and 2020. However, in Vectorworks 2021 and VW2022, we can select and delete the object from the design layer. <br/>
<br/>
The user only has access to VW2018, so I was able to export to a vw2018 version from VW2021 but we cannot understand what happened in the first place and why in the later versions we can see the objects. <br/>

We have that regression, since Layouts also gets cached.<br/>
<br/>
It is sure, that could be some work on the user-front to reduce meshes etc. But still the issue is there and we need to work further additionally on the performance of wireframe viewports.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
-In the OIP, change the door jamb width to 4&quot; then press Enter key<br/>
<br/>
-Don&#39;t move the mouse<br/>

-Notice the wall geometry doesn&#39;t refresh<br/>
<br/>
-Once you move the mouse, the geometry updates properly<br/>

Sending the file back to the customer and updating the viewports on his end will revert the rendering, showing wrong class visibilities in the viewports.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached files, simply update the viewports and see how the class visibilities repair themselves with classes either hidden as expected <br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Test_Klassensichtbarkeiten.vwx&quot; the door of the cabinet should not be visible - classes affected:<br/>
*XG-Korpusmöbel-Tür-Bauteil<br/>
XG-Korpusmöbel-Tür-Belag Außen<br/>
XG-Korpusmöbel-Tür-Belag Innen<br/>
XG-Korpusmöbel-Tür-Kante<br/>
XG-Korpusmöbel-Tür-Trägermaterial*<br/>
<br/>
these classes are all turned OFF. They render as turned ON.<br/>
<br/>
In &quot;Ohne Titel1-4.vwx&quot;, the class *&quot;XG-Bauteil Bearbeitung-Profil&quot;* should render turned OFF. The viewports are showing this class as tuned ON.<br/>
<br/>
This is a v26 file because I cannot test. As soon as I convert to 2022, the issue rectifies itself. Very elusive problem!

<br/>
The Customer informed us that after converting the file to 2021 everything was OK, but after duplicating this file, then the duplicated one shows some of the sheet layers without a name, the name field is simply empty.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot reproduce the problem, but the Customer informed us that has intentions to transform the file into a Project Sharing file and feels insecure about doing so because it has the fear that this will continue happening or that the file is simply broken, hence asked us for advice in the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to see what caused this problem and what should we advice the Customer in this matter, please?<br/>

Thank you in advance.

1-Creating a new Story with Level Types of Ceiling (with Layer Name of Ceiling) and Top of Slab.<br/>
2-Notice when I edit Level Type Ceiling by just changing it&#39;s elevation.<br/>
3-A new Instance of &quot;Ceiling&quot; is created, but the original is still the one being selected.<br/>
4-I edit again, the same check/selected Level Type, again new instance is still being selected.<br/>
5-Click &quot;Ok&quot; Edit Story Level dialog and click &quot;Ok&quot; on the New Story dialog.<br/>
6-As expected a new Story is created.<br/>
7-With the story selected, click on the &quot;Edit Button&quot;<br/>
8-In the Edit Story, edit the same Level again. Ceiling by just changing it&#39;s elevation.<br/>
9-Notice a new instance of Ceiling is created and it&#39;s selected by default. This should be<br/>
  the expected behavior in Step 3 when the story was initially created.<br/>

attached a Video, where you can see, that snapping and rotation of a Lighting Device on a truss is different between 2021 and 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Also you are not able to snap directly on the chords anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like something changed here?<br/>
Can you explain me, what it is? Some Customers are confused by this workflow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Best Regards<br/>

<br/>
1. Create a new empty document.<br/>
<br/>
2. Create a new class (or use an existing one) and change pen color of the class to red.<br/>
2.1. Active &quot;Use at Creation&quot; on the top left corner.<br/>
<br/>
3. Draw some text and see that is of the color that we have chosen.<br/>
<br/>
4. Edit the class in use and activate &quot;Use at Creation&quot; in the Text Style section on the bottom right corner. Choose any Style.<br/>
<br/>
5. Draw again some text and now the text is black. If the Style is changed to un-styled, the red color will be displayed again.<br/>
<br/>
With 2021 this does not happen, hence its a regression.<br/>

As we can see in the video, the blue from the image in the polyline changes after exporting to PDF.

If we create a new empty file with a new polyline and using the same image, the problem does not happen.<br/>

If we copy the polyline to a new blank document, the problem also does not happen.

<br/>
These are longstanding problems with Stories. Fixing them will improve usability. The good news is, these seem to be problems localized in the dialog handler, so hopefully they will be easy to fix.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have a furious user that is comparing 2017 and 2022 performance on a couple of files. Basically If user exports the attached files to 2017 version of Vectorworks they work way better compared to 2022. For 2022 they are using brand new M1 macs with 8gb of Ram and the old machine is around 2gb graphics i7 , 16 gb of ram, ~2016 model Mac computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything we can offer them or at least explain why this is happening and wether they can suspect improvements in the future?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are aware about their way of working. We explained that placing objects on different layers and working with visibility will make the file faster as well as 1:1 scale does not help. We pointed out that improving workflows will make it better but the bottom line is that 2017 is handling these files in the state that they are way better compared to 2022.

<br/>
1. Open the attached .vwx file<br/>

2. Go to Edit Mode on the Top Viewport like shown in the video<br/>
2.1. In the Edit Mode select the 5 Section Viewports and update them<br/>
2.2. Return to Viewport<br/>
<br/>
Result: Viewport is still empty<br/>
<br/>
3. Go to Edit Mode on the Bottom Viewport like shown in the video<br/>
3.1. In the Edit Mode select the 2 Section Viewports and update them<br/>
3.2. Return to Viewport<br/>
<br/>
Result: Now both Top and Bottom Viewports objects are being displayed, but the bottom Viewport has objects that seem to be misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
4. Go again to Edit Mode on the Top Viewport and return immediately to the Viewport<br/>
<br/>
Result: objects in the Viewports have disappeared again.

In the attached Document there is an example (screenshot right side) with the Wall named &quot;wall-3&quot; which you also can see in the Worksheet. the GrossWallArea is 36.8 which is the middle wall line and is OK. The WallBreak is 2 x 2m (4qm) so NetWallArea should be 32.8. But the NetWallArea in the Worksheet and IFC Export is 34.9. I think it is related to the system, &quot;Window CW&quot; creates the wall break. It would be good to know, how the Wall-Break must be created to get a complete-Wall-Break.

Create a new document. <br/>

Insert a plant. I used drag-n-drop to insert a plant from the Default content.<br/>

Please, see the image attached.<br/>

Same is happening if I import the plant first (no alert), and then insert it onto the drawing (alert).<br/>

This does not happen if I insert a plant using the tool.

They quit VSS in 2017 or 2019 and had some points with issues. Many of the we was able to fix or handle. The most important point is still open. The Delay of Drawing objects was OK for them in 2017 but slowed down in future Versions and compared to 2022 (which seems the fastest one after 2017) it is still better in the direct comparison. And thats what they do, they compare from the user-sight.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great If we would be able to speed up this kind of Drawing-&quot;Organisation&quot;. It would give us more buffer for drawing workflows, while have a lot of visible objects.<br/>

To reproduce, click-drag each Window, and hold-down the Option key on Mac (CTL key on Win) to duplicate the instance.<br/>
<br/>
With the Window that&#39;s outside of the Wall, note that the cursor shows a + sign to indicate the duplication.<br/>
<br/>
With the Window that&#39;s inside the Wall, note that the + sign doesn&#39;t show. This makes it difficult to tell if the object will actually be duplicated.<br/>

The same thing happens with all in-Wall objects in 3D views. I don&#39;t see this problem in plan view.<br/>

The same thing happens in past versions.<br/>

<br/>
I have a user having difficulties with updating references in a certain file, i cant seem to see why this is happening. <br/>
<br/>
They did have loop referencing in the files, so deleted this, however it works for a while and then becomes unresponsive when updating the references. <br/>
<br/>
If they re reference the layers into the file it starts working again but this isn&#39;t an effective solution. <br/>
<br/>
1223_2D main file with following files referenced in: <br/>
<br/>
1223_Existing_BIM<br/>
<br/>
1223_Proposed_BIM<br/>
<br/>
If you go to update these files in the 2D main file it just spins and spins. <br/>
<br/>
Any help with identifying what the issue is would be amazing. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Note: this might be related to the bug reported in VB-152939, which was resolved several versions ago. In that bug, creating a simulation from an existing object was failing on certain types of polylines. That bug was fixed, but now I&#39;m seeing failures with other types of polys that previously worked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a movie and test file that show this. The file contains three objects; a Polyline that was created with the Polyline tool, a Polygon that was created with the Polygon tool, and a Polyline that was created by filleting a Polygon object.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Send the file to AutoTURN Online<br/>
-Click the &quot;Generate Path Follow Simulation&quot; button<br/>
-Select the Polygon in the middle or the Polyline on the right<br/>
<br/>
Note that the simulation runs the enter length of the object, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try the same thing with the Polyline on the left<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it only affects a small segment. It looks like this is happening because the poly is getting broken-up into a bunch of segments.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the movie attached to VB-152939, you can see that this same poly worked fine at some point in VW 2019.<br/>
<br/>
I see the same problem in VW 2020, 2021, and 2022.

<br/>
In the attachments a file, where is very slow in a dwg export form the Layer, when the multiple view panes are active. I tested it on different layers and it&#39;s the same result, that the view panes slows down the export.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also the same thing, when I try an export in VW 2022 R1 (Build 600925).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Denis

<br/>
To reproduce, select both objects and run the Add Solids command (this is a really useful method for creating single-object Shells from multiple surfaces).<br/>
<br/>
Note that one of the surfaces disappears from the resulting solid.<br/>
<br/>
If I rebuild the surfaces using the &quot;Rebuild NURBS&quot; command, the problem goes away.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing this is a Parasolid issue.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make sure the Attributes Palette marker controls have the Marker Link Toggle button enabled<br/>
-Draw a Line object<br/>
-In the Attributes palette, choose any End Marker (which will automatically apply a Start Marker)<br/>
-Now Undo once<br/>
<br/>
Note that this only undoes the application of the Start Marker, while the End Marker remains intact. At this point the object is in kind of a contradictory state where the link toggle is still enabled but the Start and End Markers differ<br/>
<br/>
This also happened in past versions so hasn&#39;t been marked against the T02155 task.

<br/>
First bit of the Video is setting up the scenario, multiple view planes to just understand the situation better and its drawn a 3D object that is used to work the problem on.<br/>
<br/>
The scenario is already set in the attached file, so you can jump to the next part described below to reproduce the Problem:<br/>
<br/>
- Use the Set Working Plane Tool and, like shown in the video, pick a side of the 3D Object thast is not the XY. <br/>
<br/>
- After the Working Plane is set, we have the following two results when attempting to draw a rectangle:<br/>
<br/>
If we try to draw the rectangle by mouse clicking on the Rectangle Tool. The set working plane will be lost and the rectangle will be drawn in the XY-Plane.<br/>
<br/>
If we use the Keyboard Shortcut (4) for the Rectangle Tool, the rectangle will be correctly drawn in the designated working plane. <br/>
<br/>
The same happens with other shapes, like for example circles.

Actually the active class should not have an influence on &quot;Hidden&quot; line rendering.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Watch the attached movie<br/>
 # Open &quot;Testfile 20210525_01&quot;<br/>
 # Choose &quot;Hidden Line&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you can see the hatch fill is not rendered <br/>
<br/>
4. Change the pen attributes of the default class &quot;100 Entwurf Deckweiss&quot; to Solid and black.<br/>
<br/>
5. Render the file again with &quot;Hidden line&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, the hatch fill can be rendered correctly.<br/>

For example open the attached file and movie<br/>
Switch to top/plan<br/>
Click on flyover tool<br/>
Note that view shows top but will not completely switch since screen plane rectangles are still shown<br/>
Zoom IN/Out now it will switch to top view completely.<br/>
If there are any 3D objects exist and clicking on Flyover tool will work as expected.

<br/>
They sent 2020 files through and when I converted to 2021, I noticed Data Tags were not displaying in 2021 on the Sheet. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a look at the Project file, and noticed that DTs are there in the model, though in Hidden Line view, there is a graphics issue where they display only during zooming in and out, while they are invisible (but selectable) while view is still. They are visible in OpenGL as expected. Changing the viewport to OpenGL however, does not make them appear. The Data Tags are on _OMI_Ref_Unitised Elevation_ class.<br/>

<br/>
The cause appears to be that we override the context of the criteria (eVSCustomSelVisCriteria,  //Used for custom selection and custom visibility menu items) to something else  (eVectorScriptCriteria,  //Used for VectorScript editor).  Custom Selection dialog only has in-sym, in-pio, and in-viewport checkboxes.  VS makes it also look for controls like in-subparts and include owner. <br/>
<br/>
The reason appears to be that a context was doing something not quite right, and instead of fixing it we jumped to a different one.  It&#39;s gotten messier over time as we have a larger number of contexts and the number and nature of the controls has diverged more widely.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Create a Railing/Fence object with default settings<br/>
-Activate the Reshape tool<br/>
-Click on one of the blue handles<br/>

Note that when you initially click, the widget graphics show a rectangular box between the cursor and a seemingly-random point (it starts off at the document origin but then changes). Screenshots are attached showing a few different results.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

In Edit mode, when going to the Annotations, the blue hatch is also visible. Customer expects the Blue-Hatch-Objects to also be Exported to PDF, which are not.

The Vectorworks file from the test is (probably) version 16. Currently, we test v27.<br/>

If we test with the original file, the result will be different from the test result with a file created in the current version. Theoretically, the test with the original file may be perfect, but the test with a file from the current version would fail.<br/>

That means that the acceptance test does not give us an idea of what we deliver to our customers.

User has a bit of an archaic work flow, but I was able to reproduce it in a new file as well.

<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen consistently, but I&#39;ve seen it twice now where I&#39;ll simply open the Working File and the layer scale of the active layer (in this case &quot;Building Shell&quot;) will randomly change to 1:1.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only seen this happen in VW 2022, but we&#39;ve had similar problems in the past with Multi-View changing the design layer scale (particularly when sheets are active in other panes), so I doubt this is specific to VW 2022.<br/>
<br/>
I also doubt that this is related to Project Sharing, but so far I&#39;ve only seen the problem in PS files.

Attached please find a sample of the VW CPU Process when this is happening. When this happens the % CPU for VW in the activity monitor goes up to 101% and my computer fan kicks into high speed. Please let me know what your Engineering Team comes up with. Its really impairing my workflow. <br/>
 <br/>
Another weird thing happens every 5 or so files that I open in VW. When I double click the file to open it, the window opens in VW, however it is all grey. Screenshot attached. The drawing cannot be seen but the window does have the proper file name. When i close this window, the standard prompt asking if i want to save pops us. After I close the window, I double click the file again and it opens up normally. This happens pretty regularly every 5 or so files I open as mentioned above. My current project of 34 buildings requires me to open many files per session and I usually have a few files open at a time. Any ideas what is causing this?

Email from Brian Hores:<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I am seeing in Revit 2021. The openings are extrusions and plumbing fixtures and stairs are not showing.<br/>
<br/>
Took several tries to get the plumbing fixture not to export flipped backwards in the wall,  had to make duplicate symbols. <br/>
<br/>
Flipped casework is a whole other issue that still needs to be fixed. I exported without because I needed to get things started.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is not working for the consultants.  There must be a streamlined way to get this to work because every job is a challenge to get started.<br/>
<br/>
Links below.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

<br/>
A client send me this file. It&#39;s includes a viewport (Schnitt-4), that they can&#39;t update. Strange are the values of the viewport. If I compare this with other in document, the viewport has most the settings from a selection viewport but the object info call it &quot;viewport&quot;. Noticeable is the Checkbox  &quot;Display 2D fills&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I attached the file. Thank you for testing.<br/>

<br/>
Upon publishing Excel files from worksheets, using the option &quot;Export Worksheet as separate files&quot;, these use the active naming scheme (screenshot 1).<br/>
<br/>
If the naming scheme is based upon Title Block data, the  worksheet will<br/>
 * just use that naming scheme &quot;as is&quot;, stripping extra chars at the end<br/>
 * not export all worksheets, only 1<br/>
<br/>
Since the Title Block code has nothing to do with a worksheet which is not on-drawing, the naming scheme should skip these codes and use the Worksheet name + whatever applies from the naming scheme (I, like many others, use the date at the end).<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t have different schemes, since the naming is valid for PDF/DWG export AND excel.<br/>
<br/>
Please export from the attached document and observe the result (screenshot 2).

We have received a file where these specific objects that are in the file does not rotate with the rotate tool or mirror tool. Right clicking on the object and using the rotate command from the drop down works but basic tool palette rotate tool moves the object into a quite random location. Might be related with the internal origin.<br/>
