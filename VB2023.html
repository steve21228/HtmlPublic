<br/>
The layout direction has been implemented. The rest is missing.<br/>
 * The Preferences tab of the planning palette is being built by Deersoft within their power planning web palette. UI examples are forthcoming. The preferences tab will contain settings for the following:<br/>
 ** Layout direction of connected systems within graphical displays. See 2F.E:<br/>
 ** Retain sorting of columns as a default. Check box.<br/>
 *** Column sorts will be preserved during the Generate Report process.<br/>
 ** Retain column positions (left/right) between uses.<br/>
 *** Column positions will be preserved in generated reports.<br/>
 ** Retain column widths as adjusted between uses. Check box.<br/>
 ** Component tab line display.<br/>
Users may turn on, or off, line types based on color via a Check box. (See F2.F.i: )<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Connections will automatically place cables with assigned colors when users connect devices together. Connections are made using the various cable and patching workflows offered via the patching processes. [Power patching the electrical system help page.|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Cables/#h1]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Colors will be chosen via a dropdown selection window/menu. (See F2.F.i: )<br/>
<br/>
This is a list of standard cable colors as specified by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) for the US and the EU. For other countries, please refer to Figure 2F.F.2 below.<br/>
 * Three Phase default colors as per the IEC, US and EU. See Figure F.2<br/>
 ** L1 (Phase 1) color, Red in the US, Brown in the EU.<br/>
 ** L2 (Phase 2) color, Blue in the US, Black in the EU.<br/>
 ** L3 (Phase 3) color, Black in the US, Grey in the EU.<br/>
 ** N1 (Neutral 1) color, White in the US, Blue in the EU.<br/>
 ** N2 (Neutral 2) color, White in the US, Blue in the EU<br/>
 **  <br/>
<br/>
 * PE (Ground or Earth Bond) color, Green in the US. Green/Yellow in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Deersoft. This distro is an example of a unit requiring two neutral connections. This can be ignored by the publications dept.<br/>
 * Single Phase default colors<br/>
 ** Hot is Black in US and Brown in the EU.<br/>
 ** Neutral is White in US and Blue in the EU.<br/>
 **  <br/>
<br/>
 * <br/>
PE (Ground or Earth Bond) color, Green in US. Green/Yellow in the EU<br/>

Show or hide phase loads in the Device Graph tab of the web palette preferences tab.<br/>
Condensing the Device Graph display layout via hiding phase load information is accomplished by checking the Hide Phase Load Display check box.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Show/Hide columns via check boxes _(See_ {_}Figure F.4{_}{_}){_} or right-clicking columns.<br/>
Power Web Palette columns may be hidden from view via check boxes in the settings tab. All boxes will be checked to show at first use. Settings will be remembered between uses per document. All text is to be sentence case per the UI Guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Component and Device Graph settings in the web palette preferences tab.<br/>
Choose colors of wire lines via the color picker drop down in the Component Graph tab settings shown in Figure F.5 <br/>
The color picker will contain the range of colors shown in Figure 2F.F.2 IEC Phase color chart. <br/>
Options to retain the layouts set by users and their last used zoom levels are also offered via check boxes. <br/>
All text is to be sentence case per the UI Guidelines.<br/>
Deersoft will build the color picker within the web palette.

When I unpatched via the OIP, the patch remains and the [X] is not removed.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-05-03-15-39-08-724.png!<br/>
 * When a user removes the connection of a distributor to a consumer via the OIP, the dropdown choice will refresh to allow the user to reconnect to the same consumer. The refreshed information will remove the X from the assigned circuit. The assigned circuit will remain in the pull-down without the X awaiting reassignment. Once assigned to either the same or a different circuit, the dropdown will update and display the new connection information, including the requisite X.<br/>
<br/>
 ** Bug report discussing this:<br/>
Currently, In the OIP of a cable object, removing the X from a circuit dropdown menu disconnects the patched items but does not allow them to be reconnected.<br/>

 * Replacing a distributor with another that contains matching connectors will retain their connections to the extent possible. Figure B.1 Distro Drops any 208V Multicable shows a distro with four each of 120 V and 208 V output connectors on the left and a distro with eight 120 V output connectors on the right. When we replace the 120 V/208 V distributor with a 120 V distributor, any connections made to the 208 V connectors will be dropped. The 120 V connectors will transfer as they have matching connectors contained within the new distributor. The remaining four 120 V connectors, E through H, will be left empty.<br/>
 * To support the replacement of electrical devices, the name, type, and order of their connectors must be identical. When an unmatched item is encountered, all remaining connections will not be carried forward, and they will need to be reconnected manually.

Figure D.1 Parent/Child example shows two child items, and their parent highlighted. Any component downstream of the parent will be highlighted.<br/>
 * Dragging connected systems will allow users to move systems to an isolated location in the web palette layout to edit the system independently. Selecting multiple objects for editing or moving will be accomplished by holding down the shift key and clicking on each component or part. See 1F.C: above.<br/>
 * The modifier key is unnecessary to move items that are already selected and highlighted as a group.<br/>
 * Connection lines between components will stretch or adjust their paths to maintain connections between components when moved.

 * When importing distributor objects from one file, such as a favorite file, into a current drawing, all internal connection naming structures should be maintained. If a Resource Name Conflict dialog is presented during the import process, users must choose the &quot;Do not import this Format; use the existing one&quot; in order to maintain internal connections. This will allow for a consistent user experience.<br/>
 * For best results, all imports of distributors should be made into drawing files without previous versions of the devices being imported.<br/>
 * Example workflow: A user starts a new project using a blank file or a template and wishes to import prebuilt systems of connected objects from a favorite file. Importing these connected systems into fresh files poses little risk of overwriting existing items. Importing systems from secondary source pose possible conflicts with internal connection data, thereby overwriting component connections.<br/>
<br/>
To Test, open the attached file.<br/>
Open a new file.<br/>
In the new file, import the lighting layer from the file with the connected objects.<br/>
Once the parts are imported, check the power palette to see if the system maintains connections.<br/>

                Symbols in 2024 Project Sharing Disappearing
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I have a customer I have been in ongoing conversation with for a few days that is struggling with styled walls in symbols disappearing on a continuous basis.<br/>
<br/>
The user says that everyone involved in this project is using 2024 and on the same build.<br/>
<br/>
They are styled walls within symbols (including any doors and windows associated with the walls). At first Unstyled walls did not seem to also have the same issue, but it sounds like they are possibly also not saving and committing.<br/>
<br/>
They have &quot;reset&quot; the project file to a normal file to start from scratch, but the problem does not seem to resolve.<br/>
<br/>
All layers and classes are turned on and they save and commit every 5 minutes or so.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the working file does not always seem to communicate back to the project file (save and commit); the changes made does not show up in the project file.<br/>
<br/>
I had the customer send me over their file and it appears that the wall is deleted completely/the creation and changes of the wall were not saved. I pulled the problem symbol into a clean file just to double check and this seems to be the case.<br/>
<br/>
The customer says that the issue is is not just that one symbol, it happens with all the symbols in the project.<br/>
<br/>
The walls do not disappear while working, only after saving and committing, closing and releasing, and then opening the file.<br/>
<br/>
This has happened in the past then they would convert the walls back to Unstyled walls and it seemed to be ok previously. In this particular project they have intricate walls and a lot of different wall types so styled walls would be preferred if they can get it to save and commit properly.<br/>
<br/>
They have tried copying the layers over to a clean file (revert back to VW 2022). They&#39;re disappearing in vw2022 as well.<br/>
<br/>
They have checked the document settings/ preferences and they are all good.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that some line symbols are also disappearing examples 2D fridge, bed and some other furniture.

Looks like ODBC::CExtUpdateSupport::OnRecordDetached is missing a null check if format comes back nullptr from GetRecord.

If you do the same thing in from Vectorworks&gt;File&gt;Open file it works without Vectorworks freezing.

 # Hit undo and immediately click on the settings button<br/>
<br/>
If you do step 3 VERY quickly, VW will crash. If it doesn&#39;t, I just hit Enter and repeat step 3 until it does.<br/>
<br/>
To make it easier:<br/>
 * Hold Ctrl, hover over the settings button, click Z and the left mouse almost at the same time without releasing the Ctrl key at all.<br/>
 * Slow your PC down. It&#39;s easier to reproduce this in Debug mode, than it is in Release.

<br/>
Had a user complaining about this on M1 Max 64 Gb running Ventura 13.4.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried on a intel based mac (i9 32 GB and it does hang for a bit but ends up doing the ungrouping after all. Asked a college to try on a M1 Max with 64 gb and it does hang and crash. <br/>
<br/>
I am attaching the file, system information file, and crash report for your investigation. <br/>
<br/>
The group is on the Venue design layer and it is the one on the screenshot attached.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
PS: I haven&#39;t tried it yet on simple M1 or M2 processor machine. Just on M1 Max and on a Intel i9. It can be crashing on M1 Max only or on all apple silicon machines. You may want to test on all of those.

<br/>
When a Plant instance is changed from &#39;single plant placement mode&#39; to &#39;poly vertex placement mode&#39; the number of plants displayed does not correlate to the count. <br/>
<br/>
Initially it displays and counts as a single plant, however when the object is edited using the re-shape tool, it will display as two plants but count as three. It will also register on a worksheet as three. The third plant can be &#39;teased&#39; out and then deleted, however it is not possible to delete the second plant to return the object to a single plant (the way it started). <br/>
<br/>
Initially a Plant at Poly Vertices mode can be a single plant, but once edited, it counts a miniumum of three plants regardless of how many are displayed. It then can&#39;t be returned to the single plant state. <br/>
<br/>
I have marked this as critical as - in the case of mature trees - it could very easily give rise to an expensive contractual error between the design documents and contractor price.

<br/>
The customer (dennis.heinzle-redfern@suedbau.de) is trying to upload files to a shared folder from a colleague (tanja.rothweiler@suedbau.de). The client of the first shows 0.00 of 100.00 GB. Unfortunately I don&#39;t know what the client of the second shows.<br/>
<br/>
If the second one was over quota, which I do not believe to be the case, would the error say that?<br/>
<br/>
Can you please check both accounts, if there is something amiss, that I cannot see from my side?<br/>
<br/>
While their internet connection is quite slow (about 12 Mbit/s up and down), this would make any up or download slow, but not cause such errors, right?<br/>
<br/>
They were running the latest version of the VCS (12.7.2618). I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but it didn&#39;t change the situation.<br/>
<br/>
They have been working in this setup for half a year now, but only now there is this issue. They require the VCS, because they are working on Project Sharing and sometimes one of them works from home.

<br/>
I had a call with a customer.<br/>
They have 4 Architectural Licenses (3x International, 1x German).<br/>
<br/>
They are using Apple Macs with Monterey and M1 and Intel CPUs.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, Vectorworks is started in Demo mode. The License-Info still shows a licens and its modules.<br/>
<br/>
The customer is not sure when it turns into demo mode.<br/>
As far the user knows, the last time, it happened after a break and waking up the mac from sleep mode.<br/>
<br/>
For me it seems, that Vectorworks is losing the license information at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Question:<br/>
Is it possible to get into demo mode after starting Vectorworks normally (With license)?<br/>
I tried deleting cfprefsd, License-File (plist) without success.<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to go into sleep mode for a few minutes and waking it up again. Vectorworks still had all license information.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards<br/>
Alex

***Original***<br/>
<br/>
A customer called into Tech Support to see if they can get a corrupt file recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be able to assist with this as a last ditch effort to save their project?<br/>
<br/>
They are using Windows 11 Pro. The last time they opened the file was in November of 2022 and said they were likely working with Vectorworks 2023 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Notes from the user:<br/>
&quot;We have an issue with a Vectorworks file that can&#39;t be opened.<br/>
We used to work from a SERVER and when we switched to the DRIVE we replace a project folder with an older version of it, and lost some files.<br/>
After using a recovery program (The software we used for the recovery was called WONDERSHARE RECOVERIT) on the Server computer we managed to get those files back, but they can&#39;t be opened on Vectorworks, and we get this error message: This is an unrecognized file. It may be a Vectorworks file created by a newer version of the application, it may be a very old MiniCAD file. it may have been created by another application, or it may have been corrupted by a hardware or system error.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Troubleshooting that the customer has tried:<br/>
 - copying the file on the desktop and renaming it<br/>
 - Trying to import it as DWG or other files types<br/>
 - Open it with previous versions of Vectorworks <br/>
Nothing helped. <br/>
 <br/>
In addition, Tech Support attempted to open the file in newer versions of Vectorworks with no luck, as well as try to import design layers/reference from the corrupt file into a new file with no luck.

<br/>
It appears that for at least some objects the constraints are not processed correctly to the left of the DT origin.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file the DT on the right of the truss behaves properly. [Hanging Position w/Trim (Left)] Even is you attach it to the left end of the truss and then use the mirror tool on it, it still displays properly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The DT on the left end of the truss [Hanging Positions w/Trim (Right)]. The only two things I have changed in this version are that I edited the DT Layout and Mirrored all the components of the DT using the Mirror tool and a vertical line from the origin, and I changed the Truss Label text from Left Justified to Right Justified.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the polygon with the rounded ends extends to the Right of the triangle, not to the left as it is supposed to. Note that the distance it is moved to the right of the insertion point is the same as the distance it should have been moved to the left.<br/>
<br/>
Edit the Layout of the DT. Note that the constraints show that the rounded poly should be moved to the left of the insertion point.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have tried everything I can think of to get the poly to constrain right with no success.<br/>

                MVR export does not use sufficient precision

<br/>
The attached MVR was created from a drawing with a single Fixture at (1000, 2000, 4500) oriented (-30.00, 1.00, 45.00)<br/>
<br/>
{{The matrix in the MVR is:}}<br/>
{{&lt;Matrix&gt;<br/>
{0.706999,0.706999,0.017452}}}<br/>
{{{-0.606202,0.618543,-0.499924}}}<br/>
{{{-0.364241,0.342866,0.865894}}}<br/>
{{{1000.000000,2000.000000,4500.000000}}}<br/>
{{&lt;/Matrix&gt;}}<br/>
<br/>
All the numbers have six decimal places, instead of sufficient significant figures.<br/>
<br/>
This results in a calculated orientation of (-29.995, 1.15466, 44.4227) for 32bit precision, which is significantly different.<br/>
<br/>
Cast Software also reported this issue in early 2022, I was under the impression it had already been corrected.<br/>
<br/>
I also note that the MVR still doesn&#39;t say which version of Vectorworks created the file. Our customer says it was 2023 SP3.<br/>

A solution was to delete the referenced file and attach it again to the document.<br/>
So it must be something in the reference.<br/>

The steps to reproduce are not consistent but the crash always seems to occur around Sheet-9. It either crashes on Sheet 9 while rendering the viewport without rendering anything else after starting Vectorworks. Sometimes, it doesn&#39;t crash immediately while rendering Sheet-9 but requires me to render the sheet before/after Sheet-9 and it would crash either while stopping the rendering on the sheets before/after sheet-9 or while starting the render on Sheet-9. Sometimes the rendering on Sheet-9 seemingly completes, but the viewport retains the out-of-date boundary, and repeated attempt to render it causes a crash. This file is consistently crashing on the Cloud servers (running 2023 SP5) while doing Export PDF job as well and the user has reported this issue to tech support. The crash reports are from me, reproducing the crash on Mac with VW2024. Would you please take a look? Thank you!

                2024 GUI Sharding Issue
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is an issue that myself a few others with similar hardware configuration have had in past builds. Essentially after sometime working in the drawing, often after an auto-save, the entire system stops responding for a few seconds. When it does respond again the drawing space appears blank at first, if I attempt to zoom in or out via the scroll wheel the drawing space either begins to shard or turns a solid color (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
At the time that it happened I was just drawing walls and doors, popping in and out of 3D Shaded View and then back to Top/Plan.<br/>
<br/>
Per [~gmiller] here are my machine specs:<br/>
Apple 2019 Mac Pro, 3.3 GHz, 12-Core Intel Xeon W<br/>
AMD Radeon Pro Vega II, 32GB running a Asus XG49V Display @ 3840 x 1080<br/>
192 GB, 2933 MHz DDR4 RAM<br/>
macOS Ventura, 13.5 Beta (22G5048d)<br/>

When I go to a sheet layer, I can select bitmaps and viewports, but I can&#39;t select worksheets, graphic legends, or title blocks. They appear to be grayed out (as if I were in an editing context). I also can&#39;t place symbols. I tried pulling a symbol from default content and it appears to be selected in the resource selector, but the Symbol Insertion tool icon shows as if I don&#39;t have anything selected and when I try to place an object, it tells me A symbol needs to be selected. And now, as I am writing this bug, I went back to a design layer and everything is grayed, even on the active layer. Screenshots attached of grayed layer, what my cover sheet looks like currently in Vectorworks, and what it supposed to look like (from the published PDF).

The hemispheres&#39; normals are set to Imported as they should be when exported to USD and re-imported.  Shaded and RW modes render the mirrored objects strangely.<br/>

This shows up in other models like Kitchen Complete, where objects show strange shading depending on their transforms.

Record handler is not threadsafe and this function is calling GetShaderRecord and getting reflectivity properties.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The values this function needs should be stored in TextureProperties, so that record is not queried during background tessellation.<br/>

Note that this case is slightly different than UseOpenGLShaderProxy crash.  That one has been patched with SP5, this one is still open to crashing.

Our supporters narrowed it down to either one of our doors or one of our windows.<br/>
<br/>
Debugging revealed that the crash occurred within ISDK-&gt;GetObjectWallClosureInfo which is called by the PIO&#39;s regeneration code during the conversion.<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
In crash3.png, the reason for the crash is an attempted access to a non-existent array index.<br/>
<br/>
It is easily reproducable by running the simple test routine below in attached testfile.<br/>
<br/>
This is very critical and should be fixed for SP 4.<br/>

User uploaded a file that instantly crashes whenever a wall is edited. I attempted to duplicate the geometry, import the layer into a new file, reset the plug ins, etc. All actions resulted in a crash. We tested it on a Windows 11 Pro machine and a M1 Max MacBook Pro running 12.6 and 13.2. <br/>

Also when creating Polygon mode wall, if drawing wall not too close it gets connected to the existing wall in drawing. You will see that behavior in the movie I provided

 # Create a window with Tilt/Turn configuration (or a Custom Configuration with a single sash set to Tilt/Turn)<br/>
 # Try editing the Hinge Side direction, it&#39;s stuck on Right<br/>
 ## Changing it to Left doesn&#39;t change anything in the 3D Preview pane nor the window model itself<br/>
 ## It changes correctly if editing a Custom configuration in Custom Configuration Options, but if it&#39;s just a single sash the changes aren&#39;t made to the 3D Preview pane or the window itself either. It does, however, work if you have multiple Tilt/Turn sashes in a Custom window.<br/>
 # When using multiple Tilt/Turn sashes in the Custom window settings, the hinge points in the wrong direction. If I put it on Left, it points right and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
*Tilt/Turn shouldn&#39;t have In and Out controls*<br/>
 * While I was looking into the above problem I noticed that the Tilt/Turn configuration has In and Out controls (both as a window on it&#39;s own and in the Custom window settings)<br/>
 * It shouldn&#39;t. Tilt/Turn windows only open inwards.<br/>
<br/>
Could be that these problems have existed since the left and right controls were added:<br/>

The enclosed file &#39;230925_GRASMERE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT&#39; is v2023 from the user.<br/>
<br/>
I have tested it and the 3 layers with &#39;New Walls&#39; are stopping the export to Revit from Progressing. <br/>
<br/>
In the enclosed file called: &#39;VA GRASMERE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT v2024&#39; I have deleted the other layers and 29 x Enscape objects that I thought might be the cause of the export failure.<br/>
<br/>
I have hidden all the railings as well as the curved walls thinking they might be the problem but the export still fails so I include them in the 2024 file. I can not find the culprit. The user has exported to the consultant to dwg and IFC but would like to do more Revit exports if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

This is the link to one of WMS services of the portal of Puglia (One of the geographical Regions of Italy).<br/>
http://webapps.sit.puglia.it/arcgis/services/BaseMaps/Ortofoto2016/ImageServer/WMSServer<br/>

Activate the Tool Geoimage, click on Preference icon and then on the Select Service button of the dialogo box Geoimage Preferences. <br/>
Now, choose the item &quot;Manage Service or Portal List&quot; in the menu &quot;Server&quot; of  the dialogo box Select Service. When the dialog box Manage Service or Portal List opens, click on &quot;Add URL&quot; button and p&#39;aste the link above inti the text box &quot;Service or Portal URL&quot;<br/>
and add a name for the Servie, before clicking OK button. Even if the analysis process is OK, when you come back to the dialog Geoimage Preferences the number of services found is 0.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Is not Vw compatible with WMS service portals?<br/>
I am attaching a series of screenshots.<br/>
Thank you if you let me know something about.

I then referenced (design layer viewport) the survey into my main work file (originally about 350 MB, but stripped down to a single layer and purged for the purposes of this bug report). The scale bar of the referenced viewport is the correct size, but the other geometry of the survey is off by about 117% (see &quot;example of discrepancy&quot; saved view in &quot;DWG import offscale&quot; Vectorworks file); what should be about a 30&#39; length is impassioned as about 35&#39;. This is quite strange.<br/>
<br/>
When I open a blank Vectorworks file and reference the &quot;survey_import&quot; file, everything is the correct scale (see &quot;DWG_VP_correct_scale&quot;).

<br/>
When you use &quot;Hidden Object Display&quot; in combination with a Site Model,<br/>
it seems that objects behind the section cannot be detected by &quot;Hidden Object Display&quot;<br/>
because (I think) the Site Model is not really a sectionable object.<br/>
<br/>
The objects behind the section are recognized as they are visible like in 2. (i think)<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached VW 2024 file.<br/>
<br/>
If this is WAD, please enhance the Site Model!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>

<br/>
go to sheet A3.0 There are 3 detail viewports on the right.<br/>
<br/>
They are set to background render hidden line <br/>
<br/>
Select one of the detail viewports. Select the Advanced Properties tab in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
Go to attributes. Attributes use original objects but only line drawings appear in the detail viewport.<br/>
<br/>
Change the background render settings to Shaded. Notice layers 2-Floor Plan and 2-Floor Slab render. layer 1-Foundation Plan does not render.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of detail viewports in some drawings. I&#39;m afraid or what is going to happen when I upgrade to this version.<br/>
<br/>
The workaround fix is to use the eyedropper tool to transfer Render Properties from a correctly rendering viewport onto the Detail Viewport.

<br/>
attached a VW 2024 file.<br/>
<br/>
I have a AutoHybrid with Solids inside.<br/>
The Solids use Materials.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have a Datavisualization to change<br/>
the Materials, AutoHybrid&#39;s can&#39;t be addressed, that way.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the problems are the Solids inside the AutoHybrid.<br/>
I made a lot of reports related to solids with VW 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings and have a nice Weekend<br/>

They tested both on VW2023 and VW2024 - experiencing on several files an unexpected behaviour from Vectorworks. Apparently, performing certain operations on &quot;heavy&quot; files (from our experience mainly with 3d geometry) triggers the &quot;Turn off unified views&quot; preference in the background (under &quot;document preferences - Legacy 2d features&quot;), but leaving the &quot;Enable legacy 2D feature&quot; unflagged.<br/>
As a result, a document preference is changed by the software (not by the user), activating legacy features in the background, and has to be manually changed every time by users.<br/>
This also seems related to one more unexpected behaviour: after deleting a design layer, a random sheet layer is activated (see attached video).

                Plant Tool does not regard image resources
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In a recent demonstration of library objects, a user pointed out that using the Plant Tool&#39;s Create from Image feature for 3D Graphics does not see the images from the default plant image library, or image resources imported into their file.<br/>
<br/>
In testing this, with a plant placed in the file, I select to edit style, and in 3D graphics, I choose Create from Image.<br/>
<br/>
In the resource selector within this operation, it only looks for textures in the Vectorworks provided Attributes&gt;Image Fill folder. It does not even provide an attempt to look in other default image folders (designer would expect to pick from our plant image options). If you do a search for &quot;Acer&quot; in this same resource selector, it still does not find anything.<br/>
<br/>
If you do a similar search for &quot;Acer&quot; in the resource manager, it does find many image resources...most in the default Vectorworks Library&gt;Plants folders. It does provide access to the images designers would like to make their 3D representation from...this was designed to give them these resources for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
If an image is imported into the file, it also shows in the resource manager for an image resource in this file, but when attempting to choose this from the plant style&#39;s 3D graphic&#39;s Create from Image resource selector, it still does not see it as an available image resource to use.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this is because the image, though we think it seems like an image resource is actually categorized by Vectorworks as a symbol/plug-in object. Perhaps this is appropriate for a different intended workflow, but for our users they can&#39;t use it intuitively in the plant style editing like it should be. Even if the designer attempted to use it from the Copy from Symbol routine, the image is seen as a resource, but when chosen, it says there is no 3D geometry (for obvious reasons).<br/>
<br/>
If a user created their own image, taking the background out, but did not already make an image prop out of this image resource, they should be able to use Create from Image to do this operation, but cannot.<br/>

<br/>
We noted that you cleaned up your data base and moved open bugs to the next version. Therefore we were looking into our most important IFC bugs and prioritized (only 2 categories) them. We hope that some of them can be addressed for 2023 SPx or at least in the 2024 cycle.<br/>
<br/>
One thing we noted in general is that we have the &quot;feeling&quot; than there are more objects exported on a wrong position than in prior versions. Mainly nested objects are affected. But it&#39;s more a &quot;feeling&quot;. We rated them higher because of this feeling and because displaced objects cause always slightly more frustration.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here are the bugs we would be happy to address in 2023 or at least 2024:<br/>
|VB-169871: Unclaer Situation with the Data Manager and Project Sharing|<br/>
|VB-176274: Wall Component miss in IFC-File|<br/>
|VB-187635: Dormer Window is not exported to IFC|<br/>
|VB-195562: Export IFC: Multiple Break Opening CW in one Slab create overlapping geometry|<br/>
|VB-194237: Wall Closure export 2x3 failed|<br/>
|VB-188712: Wrong Export IFC of Symbols with Groups|<br/>
|VB-188911: Export IFC4: Some Space objects are exported, some are not|<br/>
|VB-193031: Objects receive the wrong coordinates with Export IFC|<br/>
|VB-182494: Objects in Groups exported with a wrong position to IFC|<br/>
|VB-185761: Wrong Coordinates of Objects when Export to IFC|<br/>
|VB-184618: Wrong Export from Custom Modeled Ramp to IFC|<br/>
|VB-196314: Data Manager: Adding a new record format detaches all other record formats|<br/>
|VB-186948: Nested Symbols still do not export properly via IFC|<br/>
|VB-196463: Wrong Export IFC|<br/>
|VB-196479: Wrong Export IFC|<br/>
|VB-191328: Wall Wrapping: Is not exported to IFC for German Windows|<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here are the bugs that have a lower priority:<br/>
|VB-181331: IFC Landscape: The right workflow to model gutters in Vectorworks (for IFC exports)|<br/>
|VB-177641: IFC Import: takes over an hour in VW, only a few minutes in others|<br/>
|VB-195655: Export IFC: Break Openings not exported due to &quot;no fill&quot; (only cylindrical!)|<br/>
|VB-194409: Conflict between Project Sharing, BCF Manager &amp; Spaces|<br/>
|VB-194529: Wrong Export IFC|<br/>
|VB-191491: Export IFC: faulty mapping of component material custom field|<br/>
|VB-190958: IFC Mapping of Wall Data doesn&#39;t work like expected|<br/>
|VB-189720: Export IFC4: Viewport lands at the same position as the original. It does work in IFC2x3 though.|<br/>
|VB-186644: IFC-Export: Psets fields with a value of 0 (zero) are not exported into IFC|<br/>
|VB-190782: Export IFC: Classification mapping fails for one symbol, but works for another|

 <br/>
 <br/>
Since my call with Adam last Friday, I’ve managed to transfer most of the information I needed; few items of note:<br/>
 * I’ve previously had great issues trying to import PP info for woodland planting; I was very time-pressured on that one so I gave up on trying to import and ended manually copying info in the plant styles as a workaround - maybe one worth investigating? (affected plants in Planting &gt; Woodland in the Resources)<br/>
 * I did my Friday’s import in several sections however plants that just got imported were sometimes not appearing as Matched already in the plugin window.<br/>
 * Few plants had blank PP records that it was impossible to remove as there were not showing as matched in the plugin window; only workaround I found was to import a new plant in to overwrite the one with the record.<br/>
<br/>

And yes, Adam, happy for you to copy over the schedules as well; relevant ones should be the ones labelled as &#39;*RFB - 2144 - Woodside Phase 1&#39;.

This is similar to:<br/>
<br/>
VB-198195<br/>
Laubwerk plants not behaving properly, sometime crashing the program.<br/>
<br/>
I have done a 4+min movie which I enclose plus a very short one. Please scrub through the parts when it is downloading and sorry it is so long but shows the amount of time it takes to download the parts even while on a connection &gt;230Mbps.<br/>
<br/>
The plants have Global settings of textures, high detail and Spring.<br/>
You will note the following:<br/>
* The palm has no leaves, branches square.<br/>
* When using the flyover tool the trees disappear<br/>
* If you move the tress in 3D they disappear. <br/>
* Can only be found in Top Plan.<br/>
* There is no selection indication when selected.<br/>
<br/>
Previously I was inserting in 3D but nothing showed, only when in Top Plan. I haven&#39;t shown that in the movie. I am unable to use this feature.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

*Windows OS notification alerts only appear for a few seconds, so Windows OS users may not notice them.<br/>
<br/>
RLM software version: v15.1<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, our improvement suggestions:<br/>
-Automatically display the account creation dialog after starting the SPN server.<br/>
-Display a message prompting the user to create an account on the last screen of the installation dialog.<br/>
*The above improvement suggestions apply to both WindowsOS and macOS.<br/>

Please check the above improvement suggestions as well.<br/>

This is very problematic as the designer will expect more data such as persistence, tolerances, performance (seasonal attributes), favored planting conditions (including zones), etc. to be mapped as well to be prepared to generate a proper plant material list and for ensuring the data exchanged in BIM file collaboration is sufficient for those receiving the designer&#39;s files.<br/>

Images attached to this VB include the data tab of a plant style with imported data from PlantMaster, and images of the potential data which PlantMaster already has to report on the same plant.

If this issue has already been reported all I want is a prognosis. I&#39;m sure it will still be worthwhile checking if my attached file offers any new info/value though. <br/>
<br/>
As the legendary Vectorworks Community liaison [Jim Wilson stated|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/50873-clipcube-is-this-strange-behaviour/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=254785], &quot;Users should be able to expect that ANY solid, regardless of what type of solid, will be properly filled by both clip cubes and sections when cut.&quot; –Which everyone would of course agree with. Because this is such a fundamental capability of Vectorworks&#39; 3D modelling and viewing technology and because it has persisted for so long, I think it is long overdue to be fixed. <br/>
<br/>
I spent some hours yesterday establishing the current state of the problem and confirming what conditions currently invoke it. You&#39;ll find these labelled in the attached file. I&#39;ve tested the current Stair Tool as it was of particular concern for members of that Forum discussion. All configurations I tested displayed fine, but that might be because the Stair tool creates {-}Mesh objects which are ostensibly unaffected by this problem{-}. EDIT: I&#39;ve since established that Mesh objects _are_ affected but in all conditions and physical arrangements, unlike other solids that exhibit this issue under certain circumstances. <br/>
<br/>
The other file attached is from a user who is unable to produce complete sections due to this problem. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know the current prognosis of this bug. Thank you!

I have here a testfile from a bigger German customer from us.<br/>
The walls in this file are converted from a previous version of Vectorworks, most likely 2021.<br/>
See video.<br/>
When clicking Reverse Sides in OIP of a wall, then the end caps suddenly jump to the other end of the wall. When pressing that button Reverse Sides several times, then the end cap jumps back.<br/>
Could you please have a look?<br/>
Customer is asking about that behavior and we should give him a good answer.<br/>
Gruß, Klaus<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, that jumping of the doors from right to left an vice versa I have already reported in VB-192720 - KLS: Reverse sides of wall with end cap changes insert position of objects in wall. This only happens with end caps.)

Also, when placed from the Symbol Insertion Tool, changing parameters from the object information palette causes the marionette object to disappear.<br/>
*The script error is a problem that occurs only in VW2023, but it has been confirmed in VW2024 that the marionette object disappears due to parameter changes after placing it with the Symbol Insertion Tool.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
-When placing with the Symbol Insertion Tool<br/>
1) Open a sample file and a new file and make the new file active.<br/>
2) Right-click the symbol &quot;Marionette&quot; of the sample file on the resource manager &gt; left-click &quot;Make Active&quot; and confirm that the Symbol Insertion Tool is automatically selected.<br/>
3) When the mouse cursor is moved to the placement destination of the drawing area of the new file and left-clicking to place it, the script error dialog is displayed 3 times and the placement is not correct.<br/>
4) When the parameters of Marionette Object are changed from OIP, Marionette Object disappears.<br/>
* Recorded in the reproduction video [^13247_1.mov] <br/>
<br/>
-When placed by dragging<br/>
1) Open a sample file and a new file and make the new file active.<br/>
2) When the sample file symbol &quot;Marionette&quot; is dragged to the location of the drawing area of the new file on the resource manager, a script error dialog is displayed once and the placement is not successful.<br/>
3) Even if the parameters of Marionette Object are changed from OIP, the Marionette object will not disappear.<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      HI VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
attached is a user file from the forum.<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/111599-deform-tool-not-working-vw-2023-sp7/#comment-485561]<br/>
<br/>
The user want&#39;s to bend an &quot;Extrude&quot; with the &quot;Deform&quot;-tool,<br/>
but the operation can&#39;t be executed. <br/>
<br/>
The base of the Extrude is a Polyline!<br/>
It seems that the Polyline is some smoothed, or has some kind<br/>
of smoothing.<br/>
<br/>
If you unsmooth the Polyline with:<br/>
Modify/ Poly Smoothing / No Smoothing<br/>
the bending-operation can be executed.<br/>
<br/>
Please see the attached video!<br/>
<br/>
It seems that some kind of &quot;smoothed&quot; Polygons/Polylines<br/>
+ Deform/Bend to not work very well together!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Tobi

<br/>
When zooming in or out, changing class settings or using any other command it takes minimal 40 seconds before the shadows show again. Sometimes it takes more then a minute before<br/>
<br/>
This interrupts a fast and efficient workflow of editing and checking drawings and settings  big time. So much that if prefer not to use them on a next project.<br/>

Enclosed is a v2017 file with an extrude and directional light. OpenGL rendering with Shadows on ground only. Note that the shadow appears to be &#39;on the ground&#39; or the lowest point in the file and is correct.<br/>
Open and convert that same file in v2024 and you&#39;ll see that the shadow is lower than the layer plane. This is incorrect.<br/>
In both versions in a viewport is created you do not see the extents of the shadow because it appears the viewport is cropped even though one does not exist. The only way to make it visible is to edit the viewport and actually add a crop! Then the extent of the shadow will be seen.<br/>

<br/>
Good day<br/>
Some time ago we sent you a Vectorworks file concerning the problem: extremely slow rendering.<br/>
On September 12, Mr. Abt contacted us by phone. We should use the quality levels and other renderers and test how the render time and quality behave in this regard.<br/>
We have now done this and found that the cloud renders massively different speeds.<br/>
 <br/>
The resolution always remained 8192 x 4096 pixels, thus the highest possible.<br/>
The different settings are attached as a pdf as well as our default setting, which we normally always use.<br/>
<br/>
We also noticed that the same renderings on the cloud have different lengths. Could it be that there is extreme variation there? Last week a rendering with all quality levels on MEDIUM without environment took about 15min and today again almost 1.5 hours.<br/>
A few weeks ago we had to render the file locally because the cloud stopped rendering after 24 hours. Last week we tried it again with our default settings and panorama and this time it only took about 1hr 15min.<br/>
It would be nice if the cloud would become more reliable again, a year ago we had no such fluctuations. Rendering locally is only possible for us in an emergency and also only during the night, since we have to work in Vectorworks every day.<br/>

<br/>
I was in a call with a customer who wanted to use the cloud Services to sync a project file to work on it.<br/>
<br/>
But whatever I tried to do, the files never synced.<br/>
Even newly uploaded files within the Home folder wont get synced.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to delete the .ini file in the hidden .config folder but that didn&#39;t help.<br/>
Also download the latest version of the Cloud Service Application didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
We also weren&#39;t able to log off from the Cloud Application, the button didn&#39;t respond.<br/>
<br/>
We created a new account and it worked instantaneously. Login, Logoff, Upload, download files, everything synced within seconds.<br/>
<br/>
So our guess here is, that the account, they are using, is somewhat bugged.<br/>
I wonder if you can check this account a bit deeper.<br/>
The login of this account is &quot;Projektassistent&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help and have a good calm weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards<br/>

Enclosed is vectorworks 2024 file : Excelimportissues.vwx<br/>

Book1.xlsx : imported fine as a reference (See attached screenshot)<br/>

CAM_Digga_V1.xlsx : imported fine as a reference (See attached screenshot)<br/>
<br/>
CAM_Digga_V2.xlsx : imports so I can see it in the window that opens up but when I put it on the sht-1 its a blank X as per the screenshot. On VW 2023SP6 you could then double click on the blnk with an X and it would refresh and your spreadsheet becomes visible.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Funnily enough after having referenced (file relative path) the 3 above xlsx files as per the screenshot and saving the file when I now re-open it Vectorworks immediately crashes. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Seperately: <br/>
<br/>
CAM_SophieWare.xlsx : when I try to import this file for some reason it thinks there are hundreds of rows with data . It finally imports but then crashes Vectorworks. When excel does this it would be nice to beable to select how many rows and columns we want to import. This also destroys your vectorworks file as everytime you re-open VW it crashes so you&#39;ll lose any work not in backup or a previous file version. <br/>

<br/>
One of our users reported this problem with the callouts changing the colours when copied from his file to a blank new file.<br/>
<br/>
After pasting them to the new file, the Attributes palette still shows the &quot;original&quot; colour, although the colour is changed for the callout and it is also changed on the &quot;Leader Attributes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The problem does not happen when copying a callout from a blank new file to a second blank new file, so it seems that there is something on the user&#39;s file causing thins problem.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recorded a video showing the problem. I am attaching the video, the original VW file (2021) and the v2024 file.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tested this in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 and the problem happens in all of them.

In each case, I was working in a file like the attached one, which contains just an Extrude and an RW Camera. Prior to the crash I:<br/>
 * Activated the RW Camera&#39;s view<br/>
 * Clicked the Fine Tune Camera button in the OIP<br/>
 * Dragged a few sliders (I was working mostly with the top four sliders)<br/>
 * Exited the dialog by pressing the ESC key<br/>
 * Did a few Undo operations<br/>
<br/>
In one case, VW crashed after (what seemed like) the first Undo operation.<br/>
<br/>
In the other case, the RW Camera object disappeared and only showed its blue handles. I deleted it, then created a new RW Camera which was completely invisible. Then VW crashed after a second or two.<br/>
<br/>
Crash logs are attached.<br/>

<br/>
If the window is given an offset in the wall, the external sill will reposition along with the offset window position. The internal sill doesn&#39;t reposition in the same way, therefore creating a gap or an overlap of the 2 elements, depending on whether the offset is towards the external side or towards internal side.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached an example Vectorworks file indicating this.

It contains a cropped viewport. It is properly visible with  top view, but when you rotate it the content disappears.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that the viewport crops the content to a rectangle in world space. Then the content is cropped to a rectangle in screen space, so everything disappears.<br/>

When the Clip cube command is activated, Vectorworks displays a cut-out drawing instead of the complete envelope box.<br/>
This was already a problem in version 2023.<br/>
This is the same result as when you activate the command with the Ctrl/Cmd key held down, to recover the previous delimitation.<br/>
But here, the Ctrl/Cmd key is not used.

&quot;I would like to know if there are any changes in the installer between VW2020SP6 and VW2021SP2 that could cause this kind of trouble.&quot;<br/>

Problem installation: VW2021SP2/ VW2021SP5/ VW2023 (SP unknown) *All are SG.<br/>
*When the troubleshooter performed an installation test on VW2020SP6, it was said that there was no problem.<br/>

As this is a question from an important large customer, an early response is desired. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we would appreciate your help.<br/>

<br/>
Please watch attached movie. <br/>
<br/>
In OnGetInteractiveSizingParams, I&#39;m passing 2.3m as default elevation (see log below). <br/>
But the modification points are not at that Z position (for reference, the upper 3D locus is at Z = 2.3m).<br/>
<br/>
Even worse: Even if the window is dragged to the side which should change the width only,<br/>
In OnSetInteractiveSizingParams I get a different elevation which of course causes the window to &quot;jump&quot; down.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between the values is the difference between the layer height and the bottom bound of the wall.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One being the main file: &quot;6000_RAB...&quot;<br/>
The other being the referenced file: &quot;RAB_MASTER...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First scenario:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open and keep both files open with Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
2. Update the reference in the &quot;6000_RAB...&quot; file.<br/>
<br/>
Result: it will update under 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Second scenario:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open ONLY the &quot;6000_RAB...&quot; file.<br/>
2. Update the reference in the &quot;6000_RAB...&quot; file.<br/>
<br/>
Result: It will need almost 40 minutes to update (28.0.7) and with 29.0.2b(721584) after 1 hour is still trying to update (showing 0% on the bottom bar).<br/>
<br/>
This problem was also happening with 28.0.5, but then fixed with 28.0.6. Now it is again happening with 28.0.7, hence I am marking this as a Regression.<br/>
<br/>
I have tested this with both Windows 11 and MacOS 13.5 and its important to have in mind that with Windows 11 I am using a 13th Gen i-9 13400K and 64GB RAM, therefore its not because the hardware is not up to par.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this. Thank you in advance.

<br/>
Note; When an elbow is associated with a Grid Line bubble, the elbow (and bubble) retain the Page Based scaling and will therefore offset dramatically from it&#39;s required position, thereby breaking the visual association with the Grid Line (eg; on VP 1/Sht-2 grid 20 appears to align to grid 21). This could give rise to a critical error on a documentation set as the grids are incorrectly identified. <br/>
[notwithstanding the separate but associated bug report VB-199799 of the Grid Line Bubble not correctly scaling and/or not correctly responding to the Page Symbol scaling factor.]

Note; the Grid Line Bubbles do not scale and/or do not scale consistently between VPs. <br/>
Observe (bottom right) Viewports 1/Sht-3 and 1/Sht-5 are identical, however the Grid Line Bubbles appear differently. <br/>
<br/>
Observe Viewport 1/Sht-2, the Grid Line Bubbles do not respond to Page Symbol Scaling - even although they are Page Scaled Symbols. <br/>
The Bubbles do have a scale factor applied, but it&#39;s not clear where that factor is coming from. <br/>
<br/>
[I have observed that if the Page Symbol Scaling value is applied to a VP of scale (say) 1:1000 and then a duplicate of that VP is created and the VP scale changed to (say) 1:5000, the Grid Line bubbles +will+ scale. But they won&#39;t respond and/or update if the Page Symbol Scaling value is applied +after+ the 1:5000 VP is created.]

                Railing: Style with corner supports ON seems to be missing a post when created
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Seen in the attached video and file, there are two identical railing styles except for their corner support setting. The style with &quot;support at corners&quot; off does not add posts at the top and bottom angle change of the railing path. This is to be expected (even though it does look strange to have magic cables change direction in mid-air).<br/>
<br/>
What is unexpected however is that creating a railing with &quot;support at corners&quot; turned *on* results in a post missing at the bottom angle change of the path where it appears there should be a post (because there is a post at the top angle change of the path.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, editing the railing to make the seemingly invisible post visible is not successful.<br/>
<br/>
It almost seems like the 2&#39; equal spacing setting for posts is being applied to the _entire_ railing path in a case like this whereas the spacing should perhaps &quot;start over&quot; when it encounters a corner, especially an angle change like this.  <br/>

                Railing: Guardrail top-rails are twisted
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the attached file (The Architect PIO demo file) I have the railings looking good after many attempt... except that the top-rails of the two noted guardrails are twisted. I _feel_ like I have tried everything (adding posts where needed, removing unneeded posts, re-applying gravity many times) but I cannot seem to make these guardrails be perpendicular to theirs supporting posts.<br/>
<br/>
A few things to note:<br/>
 * The railing style in the file has been newly re-imported from our existing content on Aug 23.<br/>
 * Support at Corners for this railing style is intentionally off.<br/>
 * All posts in all railings are located where they should be, so resetting the posts would result in a lot of work to re-place them.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping you can help solve this. Thank you!<br/>

                Light sources still limited to 8 in Shaded render mode
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Please see the attached file and screen recording. <br/>
<br/>
In recent releases Vectorworks, Inc. have promoted that the Shaded render mode was free from the 8-light maximum that was enforced for OpenGL. This appears to be untrue –at least for certain light sources: When I set up 10 Heliodons OR 10 Directional lights each representing a unique time of day, a maximum of 8 shadows can be seen. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve considered the possibility that Shaded render mode is limited in the number of shades it can display for each colour but some symptoms suggest that is not the problem here. I&#39;ve done a pretty thorough job at accounting for overlapping light washing out other shadows and the varying brightnesses the sun delivers at different times of day, etc. Perhaps I&#39;ve not accounted for everything, but the best evidence is seen in the screen recording where you can see one shadow disappears when an adjacent shadow reappears as I adjust the projection angle of one light source ever so slightly. <br/>
<br/>
Since making that recording I&#39;ve added 10 Point Lights to the file and confirmed they too seem to only produce a maximum of 8 shadows. <br/>
<br/>
This matter came to light because one of our customers is trying to do a solar study, examining what impacts the shadows of their proposed building will have on its surroundings, at different times of day, across different times of year, so it&#39;s a really important need.

Users can sync their landscape projects on both platforms to contain the same amounts and sorts of plants by either exporting plant data to the PlantMaster site to update the plant database in their account, importing plant data to Vectorworks to create new Plant Styles or both. This way PlantMaster users gain a way to visualize their projects with Vectorworks and Vectorworks users gain access to a new plant data database.<br/>
<br/>
Plant master is a new plug-in that is intended to be available from the Install Partner Products Page. It is implemented as a Web Palette and after installation can be found in Window\Palette\Web Pallets\Plant Master.<br/>
<br/>
In order to be able to test, one needs to sign up at the Plant Master site.<br/>

It may also be that the export has a lot of textures in it and we need to optimize the export instead.

                Worksheet ObjectData Function not working with compound criteria
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The ObjectData function(s) [at least ObjectData(&#39;General Name&#39;) and ObjectData(&#39;Universal  Value&#39;) do not seem to be able to accept compound criteria in a spreadsheet cell. They function properly when used in a Database where the database criteria is compound.<br/>
<br/>
In Worksheet-1 of the attached file there is a Parking Spaces object in the Site-Parking-Bikes class.<br/>
<br/>
Row 6 is a Database with the compound Criteria of ((C=&#39;Site-Parking-Cars&#39;) &amp; (PON=&#39;Parking Spaces&#39;)).  The database header row formulas are:<br/>
<br/>
Column A  =OBJECTDATA(&#39;General Name&#39;)<br/>
Column B =OBJECTDATA(&#39;Universal Value&#39;, &#39;Parking Spaces&#39;, &#39;No of Spaces&#39;)<br/>
Column C =Count<br/>
Notice that the values returned in the database all appear to be correct.<br/>
<br/>
Rows 11 to 27 are Spreadsheet cells showing variations in criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Rows 11-15 are using ObjectData(&#39;General Name&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Rows 16-21 are using ObjectData(&#39;Universal Value&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Rows 23-27 are using Count<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Notice that the first two rows of each group are using single criteria and are returning the expected values.<br/>
<br/>
The 3rd-5th rows are using compound criteria with different arrangement of parentheses.<br/>
<br/>
For the two ObjectData sets, the compound criteria return a value of zero which is not the expected value.<br/>
<br/>
For the Count set, the compound criteria (using any version of the parentheses) returns the proper count.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This appears to show a bug in the ObjectData functions that are using criteria.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The expected result would be for the compound criteria to function as they do for Count and allow the ObjectData functions to return their expected values of the Name of the Object or the value of the &quot;No. of Spaces&quot; field.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have tried numerous other combinations of compound criteria including using the Criteria Builder and have not found a compound criteria that works.

All objects selected, mirror tool selected, center line of mirroring drawn. Note that the initial (light blue) mirrored image appears very quickly, and that in that image the doors are all shown as expected (ie: flipped in relation to the mirroring operation). Then note the long lag, after which the &quot;final&quot; mirrored objects appear, but also note that all doors have now changed their swing directions. The only workaround (I can find) is to manually change each door&#39;s swing one at a time... Fixing this is high priority for me. Let me know if you need anything more. THX<br/>

 * Run the Tools/Origin/Center Drawing on Internal Origin command.<br/>

Note that this causes the Irrigation network to show incorrectly, where some elements get moved away from the rest of the network.<br/>

The problem is present in 2022, 2023 and 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Weird thing is I have older worksheets where this works - like in attached screenshots where it says &#39;Single Objects&#39;. When I recalculate the worksheet in 2023, it stays correct but I cannot replicate the correct calculation in another cell. 2024 has converted the file correctly but I get a crash when I want to recalculate - not sure if it&#39;s related or not.<br/>

<br/>
He said the references X-ARCH and X-ARCH-NEW freeze up this main file when doing any sort of editing or deleting from the organization palette.<br/>
<br/>
Notes from his email.<br/>
<br/>
When Reference Vectorworks files gets updated, the main file tend to crash/get stuck while updating the file. <br/>
<br/>
Other scenarios the crash would occur when: <br/>
1. Opening a file - Gets stuck at &quot;5 of 11 Updating References&quot; <br/>
2. Updating Reference file from the Navigation (right click &gt; update) <br/>
3. Editing Reference File (right click &gt; edit) <br/>
4. Deleting Reference File (right click &gt; delete) One remedy I&#39;ve done to make the file usable is when the corrupted Reference file is deleted, moved, or relocated (a.k.a. breaking the link).<br/>
<br/>
I found if i created 2 new blank VW files X-ARCH and X-ARCH-NEW I could use them to link in the organization palette and then delete the referenced files.<br/>
<br/>
If deleting the reference files without linking, Vectorworks just becomes unresponsive.<br/>
<br/>
User sent a 2022 file, but i found the issue was the same in 2022 and 2023

                It is complicated to make worksheet functions work after changin the call format from &quot;text&quot; to &quot;general&quot;
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When you have a cell which has the cell format setting &quot;text&quot;, off course, functions are not going to work.<br/>
But when you change the cell format to &quot;general&quot; afterwards and recalculate the worksheet, the functions are still not working, as if you didn&#39;t change any setting.<br/>
This is very confusing.<br/>
In stead, you need to do some very specific manipulations in order to make the cell function in a normal way again:<br/>
- You need to make the cell empty<br/>
- You need to confirm the empty cell, so the cell shows empty in the worksheet as well<br/>
- Finally, you need to re- enter the function.<br/>
<br/>
This is problematic because: If the user already realizes the call doesn&#39;t work as it should because of a wrong setting, changing the setting doesn&#39;t help immediately. Also re- entering the function doesn&#39;t help. The average user will not succeed in following the correct steps, so will conclude the worksheet is corrupted. On top of that, in case of a large worksheet, re- entering the functions can be a lot of work.

It&#39;s quite odd however presented quick views in the setting pane dosn&#39;t correspond with choosen options from the list.<br/>
For instance, when I choose shaded faces with no lines, the result is quite opposite.<br/>
It works like that for most of the representation types, but only here - in the setting pane. In the model area all is presented in a propper way.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the options in the dropdown list are shifted somehow.

The aligned hardscape is aligned to a path hardscape.<br/>

Observe that the aligned hardscape has holes in the vertical wall where the alignment happens. It seems that some of the boundary points are not sent to the adjacent surface definition polygon.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is an epsilon ModifyTIN problem as ModifyTIN is used to insert the surface definition polygons in the aligned surface when *Interpolate surface* is on.

                Curved Hardscapes Create Jagged Edges on Site Model, Regardless of Simplification Tolerance

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The attached file contains a Site Model and two Site Modifiers with curved edges that share geometry (so that the Site Model forms perfectly-vertical faces between them). The file also contains a Hardscape whose shape matches the upper modifier&#39;s shape. Both the modifiers and the Hardscape have a Simplification Tolerance of 0&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Site Model shows a series of jagged edges in the area where it&#39;s cut by the Hardscape (see attached screenshot). This looks like some kind of mismatch in the tolerance between the Hardscape and the modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
This gives the Site Model an awkward look and probably adds to the computation time.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to be apparent when the Hardscape is cutting the Site Model, so it wasn&#39;t really an issue prior to SP4. Based on that I&#39;ve marked it against the T02357 task, but if it needs to be removed just let me know.

<br/>
If the Class Attributes (of the assigned Class) +are not set+ to &#39;use at creation&#39;, then the fill of the Hardscape instance will take the Attributes Palette fill. <br/>
If the Class Attributes (of the assigned Class) +are set+ to &#39;use at creation&#39;, then the fill of the Hardscape Instance will take the attributes of that Class. <br/>
However, for Hardscape instances that were previously drawn, the Attributes are NOT refreshed. <br/>
A change of Fill Attribute via the Attributes Palette will trigger the previously drawn Hardscape to render the Fill attribute of the assigned Class. <br/>
So it works for some instances but not others, depending on whether or not the Attributes Fill has been activated. <br/>
This is very confusing and inconsistent. <br/>
The behaviour can be forced to be consistent by making the Attributes Palette Fill &#39;by Class&#39;. <br/>
Personally I think that if the Main Area Class is set to &#39;use at creation&#39; then the Attributes Palette fill should display &#39;by Class&#39;. This seems especially true as the attributes of the Hardscape 2D Main Area Class specifically states that to be the case. <br/>
I have not checked how the Pen attributes respond.

In SP2, note that the edge offset gets applied to only one edge.<br/>

In SP3, note that the offset gets applied to three of the four edges.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the 679904 change, it looks like square-cut Roof Faces should now be showing the offset on all of their edges, to match the behavior of the other Eave Cut options.

If I try to change the line weight of wall caps in the Wall Attributes dialog, nothing is affected.

<br/>
attached is a customer file.<br/>
I contains roff object with several skylights and dormers.<br/>
But the objects cannot be edited any more.<br/>
For me they seem to be sort of &quot;zombie&quot; objects - you still see them, but they are not really there any more.<br/>
Activate roof and perform copy (cmd+c). All roof elements do disappear.<br/>
<br/>
How can this happen? What to tell the customer to prevent this in future.<br/>
Can the document be repaired or does the customer has to start from the scratch?<br/>

The Client has a quite simple roof to model, but for some roof slopes VW creates holes at the connection point.<br/>
Holes start to appear if slope of bottom parts of the roof is higher than 30deg.<br/>
I tried various combinations of angles for all the roof parts with the same result. See a file for examples.<br/>

Symbol 2 contains a NURBS surface pasted from a symbol from another file that was sent to me by a user. I don&#39;t know how the curve was created. I&#39;ve isolated this to be geometry that causes Generate2DFrom3DComp() to fail. Ideally, the command should ignore this surface, which seems to have no area.<br/>

The behavior is the same for VS and the ISDK call.

Switching from arc to straight also doesn&#39;t work, because at any moment you finish an arc segment, the wall finishes. In this ways you are force&quot;d to stop drawing the polyline.

 # When relevant parameters are by style making the widget non-functional:<br/>
*A.* Hide the handing widget<br/>
*B.* Show the Interior Side widget grayed and disabled. This case could possibly use the same translucent icon that shows on the opposite side of wall when hovering over the active Interior Side widget.<br/>
 # Only show these widgets when they&#39;ll be a reasonable size for the current zoom level.<br/>
IOW: Don&#39;t show when you zoomed out looking at 60 selected doors.<br/>
 # Possibly have limited scaling of them for reasonable zoom levels.<br/>
 # Possibly only show them on a selected object while the cursor hovers over the object (rather than always show them).  Note: It may still be desirable to see the Interior side widget for multiple selected insert so we should think more on this one.

                    <br/>
if (wall.FindBreak(wrp.m_obj,brk))  {<br/>

<br/>
} // **<br/>
<br/>
After the call to UpdateBreak, I checked the wall and its breaks and found the wall break at the correct position (new_offset).<br/>
<br/>
However, in the actual drawing the break still had the old offset.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Vectorworks undoes my offset change somewhere after OnSetInteractiveSizingParams.<br/>
<br/>
It is vital for our interactive resizing that we can do that. If this isn&#39;t the right place to actually move the break, we need to find another solution.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can introduce a new EInteractiveSizingType::eISZ variable that we can set in OnSetInteractiveSizingParams.<br/>
<br/>
It could be named like eISZ_NewSymbolBreakOffset, and if the plug-in fills it in OnSetInteractiveSizingParams, Vectorworks will move the break to fInteractiveSizingInfo[eISZ_NewSymbolBreakOffset].fCurrentValue.

 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having an issue, with a file that keeps crashing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The file attached, every time i try to create a window and customise the openings vw just crashes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If i do this in a new file it doesn&#39;t crash but i wanted you guys to have a look at the file to see if there&#39;s an underlying bug. This is also a file from vw2022 converted into vw2023.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The steps i do to crash it are:<br/>
 # In any design layer go to either the icon or the shortcut to create a window<br/>
 # go straight to settings without placing the window.<br/>
 # on the window settings menu go to - General - configuration and press custom configuration options ( and it should crash)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
i&#39;ve only tested this on the latest SP5 on the beta SP5 and the Retail SP5.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve attached the logs, they should have been sent.

                SBE: Interactive reshaping: Position shifts if window becomes corner window
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Please watch attached movie. After the window becomes a corner window, the left (seen from below) side moved a bit to the right. To make it clearer I have drawn a line perpendicular to the wall at the beginning of the window.<br/>
<br/>
In task T02348 it says:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Because of this, the width reported by the tool (in its floating data bar) <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;must be adjusted by the offset amount to insure the correct width is displayed <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;to the user and returned back to the insert upon completion.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;This will insure expected results for users and will prevent the opposite side of a corner window from unexpectedly shifting.<br/>
<br/>
But here this unexpected shift happens.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that this is not easy to solve as we have contradictory requirements. <br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, the users enters a value for the window with and expects that the width he enters will become the corresponding width in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, users will expect that the opposite side of the window (i.e. the one they did NOT drag) remains in place. But as the actual window width is not calculated from the bisecting line but from like the imaginary window frame or (in case of CW windows) sometimes from an imaginary &quot;finished size&quot; or &quot;unfinished size&quot;, we can&#39;t do both.<br/>
<br/>
So what is the plan here? <br/>
<br/>
- Accept the small offset?<br/>
- Prevent the transformation from non-corner window to corner window altogether?<br/>
- Some sophisticated solution that will need to involve that the PIO calculates some offset so VW can somehow calculate the returned eISZ_BottomCenterPointX (and VW then needs to rename the data bar prompt as the value in the data bar will not represent the actual &quot;Window Width&quot; anymore)?

{*}Issues ({*}edited on *2023-08-11* using build *717904):*<br/>
 # {*}Door - Double Acting{*}: Geometry issue when Interior Side is &quot;Left Side of Wall&quot;:<br/>
Arc in Top/Plan appears shifted and does not meet dashed line of leaf.<br/>
<br/>
 # {*}Door - Double Egress{*}: Geometry issue when Interior Side is &quot;Left Side of Wall&quot;:<br/>

Specifically, the interior kick plate still seems to be using the wall direction&#39;s definition of the interior side, not the door setting. See the video showing the difference between the kick plate behavior vs. interior trim.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done a comprehensive check to see which other settings do what. And I haven&#39;t checked the window for similar behavior.<br/>

Here&#39;s a list of exterior/interior (and left/right) elements I&#39;m seeing that are based on the wall direction rather than the insert&#39;s Interior Side Setting:<br/>
<br/>
*DOOR:*<br/>
 * Asymmetric Top shapes (e.g.: Slope from Left/Right) (VB-197655)<br/>
 * Left/Right Sidelights (VB-197655)<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Jamb geometry<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Leaf geometry<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Sash geometry<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Marker (3D Visualization pane)<br/>
 * 3D Tag (ID Tag pane)<br/>
 * Kick Plate (Leaf pane)<br/>
 * Louver geometry (Louvers pane):<br/>
Should alway slope down toward the exterior side of the insert.<br/>
 * Hardware (Hardware pane):<br/>
Exterior handle should always face exterior side of insert.<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Kick Plates (Kick Plates pane)<br/>
<br/>
*WINDOW:*<br/>
 * Asymmetric Top shapes (e.g.: Slope from Left/Right) (VB-197655)<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Jamb geometry<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Sash geometry<br/>
 * Interior/Exterior Marker (3D Visualization pane)<br/>
 * 3D Tag (ID Tag pane)<br/>
 * Louver geometry (Louvers pane):<br/>
Should alway slope down toward the exterior side of the insert.

I created a new style in a blank file and I am using that as a basis to duplicate all the existing styles in this file. I use it to create a new style, and I import the settings of the original window style to the new style. The custom configuration does not import correctly. Also, sometimes when I go to edit the custom configuration, Vectorworks crashes. Also, the weirdest thing, sometimes when I edit the custom configuration in the new window style, the preview does not at first appear. I will cycle through the different panes and eventually the preview will appear. Once I am finished editing though, the preview is also in my drawing area as a group of 2D geometry in screen plane.

All three cases above must have the same handing related parameter behavior to provide a predictable result.  The attached &quot;{*}Handing Parameter Behavior on and after Insertion and with Flip Button.vwx{*}&quot; file has several layers of Door or Window objects set to various Configurations and Operations and the expected behaviors for those three cases listed above.<br/>

Getting stuck &#39;Loading Cineware&quot;. This has been happening intermittently for both 2023 and 2024. In the past I have tried renaming the user folder eventually giving up and re-installing. <br/>
I have found via the Forum that if you delete the Redshift plug in from this location:<br/>
/Applications/Vectorworks 2024/Cineware/plugins/Redshift_OSX<br/>
The program will launch, as it does.<br/>
<br/>
I always endeavour to have a clean installation of each build. I am on a MBP M1 64GB UM with no external monitors on the latest macOS 13.5.1. Thus has happened on 13.5<br/>
I enclose the .spx file from this machine.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

* Model a structural member frame in top plan in poly insertion mode. This is the easiest way to model portal frames <br/>
* The above will have the steel profile in the wrong orientation - rotate profile in OIP 90 degrees. With the structural member still &#39;flat on the ground&#39; the 2d representation is correct.<br/>
* Stand the frame upright in 3d.  Back in top plan view the the 2d representation is showing the width flipped<br/>
* Now rotate the profile to 0 degrees in the OIP - the 2d representation is still incorrect as it flips again.

<br/>
in the attached file the bridles were all inserted using manual insertion and a specific leg height (15.4m), the hoist was inserted with the same high hook height.<br/>
<br/>
If the hoist is deleted and reinserted as a deadhang bridles down leg then the error message disappears.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if this is working as intended or a bug but in real world terms it is wrong as the hanging could be a ibeam which can support multiple baskets and a hoist at the same location<br/>

I realise this won&#39;t be a high priority as it might just be file related because I imported those two layers and layer objects into a blank file and it exported fine. So it must be file related but I report anyway.<br/>

In the attached file the drop supporting one end of the lower truss is a daedhang bridle and when the system is caculated the drop is not included in the caculation overview, the drop itself has no caculation results added to its properties in the OIP (force leg 1 and force downleg fields) and lastly the drop displays as if it has no cross section data (greyed out). Worse since the drop is effectively excluded from the calculation the calculation overview displays that the system has passed until the user looks as the calculation report pdf, which clearly displays that the bridle has failed despite all the relavent data to calculate the bridle being included.<br/>
<br/>
This issues only affects drops when the option to use bridle parts is selected, if the older &#39;fake&#39; deadhang hoist object is used then the drop caculates correctly.<br/>
Individual deadhang bridles also beahve correctly when not used as a drop.<br/>
<br/>
This is a critical fail as the user can&#39;t clearly see that the drop has failed until the final report is created and exported.<br/>
I&#39;ve tested this in both 2023 and 2024 the issue is present in both

<br/>
The enclosed file will open on two truss objects with some instruments. A red rectangle has been drawn around it to ensure we see it.<br/>
<br/>
If you run the &#39;Export to MVR&#39; command accepting the defaults, and try and open it in Vision it fails. Vision says there&#39;s no new data.<br/>
<br/>
If you delete the two sticks of truss (leaving the lights there) and try again it will work so it&#39;s something to do with the truss.<br/>

 # Open &quot;GIS Acceptance Test.vwx&quot;<br/>
 # Go to layer &quot;Medway&quot;.  It uses  &quot;US State Plane Coordinate System (NAD83)&quot;. Look at the coordinates of the geometry (2D polygons)<br/>
 # Import &quot;medway1&quot; image with default settings. <br/>
 # The coordinates of the geometry are transformed and this is wrong.<br/>

Note: This is not the sequence used in the acceptance test. The coordinates of the image are not for this coordinate system and this is expected.  However the geometry in the layer is transformed and the coordinate system of the layer is changed. There is no warning that this would happen and we don&#39;t want that.

<br/>
It contains a site model with a retaining edge and a planar pad.<br/>
<br/>
The planar pad seems to be blocking the contours walking on the vertical part of the retaining edge which is right below the pad. This can be best seen with the extruded contours (and ungrouping them).

<br/>
The file contains a site model with two pads and two grade limits.<br/>

The extruded contours of the left grade limit are clockwise contours which have fill, but instead they should be added as holes to a boundary extrude.<br/>
<br/>
The extruded contours of the right grade limit have the issue from VB-198566.

VW 2023 SP2 or SP3 won&#39;t export to IFC the site model on file untitled 3 nor any other site model I&#39;ve created from scratch unless you copy and paste the site model and it&#39;s modifiers to a new file (our default.sta file which is a file with units in meters an A3 paper size on a design layer and with scale 1/100. With this specific design he had to use VW 2022 since VW 2023 was updating the site model in many minutes and 2022 took a few seconds to update the changes while he worked on them. The problem with the 2022 file saved in 2023 is that VW disregards the crop polygon. As a workaround I copy and pasted the grade limit inside the crop, placed the copied grade limit in the correct place, did a polygon with the paint bucket option, deleted the grade limit and initial crop polygon and it kind of worked except that it created some bad geometry that prevented VW from exporting to iFC - files on Archive.zip. A second try created what seemed to be good geometry in VW, it exports to ifs, but created some additional triangles that shouldn&#39;t be there.  This is becoming a real user and if the word spreads we&#39;ll pretty soon have these users move to Revió in order to be able to work with the rest of the team

The site model contains extruded contours which have only outlines and no solid fill.<br/>

Also the site model has missing extruded contours on the sides. Probably the two issues are related and maybe have something to do with contours clockwiseness.<br/>

Or maybe the problems have something to do with the attached asserts (&#39;extruded contours assert 1.png&#39; and &#39;extruded contours assert 2.png&#39;).<br/>

End result is GenerateTIN called once for the site model update support (because it&#39;s called first and the flag for it is still true), and once more for the parameter change (here, flag is not read at all).<br/>
<br/>
This behavior can be tracked back to CL 675158, which is fix for VB-190947<br/>

It works with 2024 Beta4 (714492), but I have no confidence the issue is resolved. <br/>

The issue affects all Plant Form, Detail, Misc, Custom image fields.

<br/>
I have noticed this on the macOS and a user has just complained to us in support about this on Windows.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see from the movie, when an object has been selected, if you want to change how a texture is mapped you then go to the Render tab of the OIP. Next to the texture in question there should be a pull down allowing users to change the mapping type.<br/>
<br/>
However, most times, it is not visible. The only way to get it is to click face name above the texture name and then back on the texture name and the down arrow then appears. It might seem a small thing but it befuddles users who can&#39;t readily understand how to change the mapping.<br/>
<br/>
I enclose a file but this is not file related but it&#39;s the one used in the movie. Also a screenshot of his Windows computer showing the pull down being invisible. I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s on Windows 11.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

A previous bug fix (VB-178295) disabled the conversion key.<br/>

However, we received a message from a customer that it was inconvenient if this conversion key could not be used.<br/>
So the question is, is it possible to fix the VB-178295 issue without disabling the conversion key?<br/>

Now try to resize Window/Door using Shift Key<br/>
<br/>
Note that it is not constraint to square it can actually resize anyhow you want.<br/>

                T02356 - NURBS Vertices Disappear When Canceling Reshape Operations
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Double-click to activate the Reshape tool<br/>
- Draw a marquee around a few vertices<br/>
- Begin dragging the vertices, then press the ESC key to cancel<br/>
<br/>
Note that all of the vertices that aren&#39;t selected now fail to show. If you change the view, they&#39;ll appear again.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem in SP3 using the old Reshape method.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this with NURBS Curves or 3D Polygons.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it might be Mac-only.

<br/>
The dialog contains a symbol display control with a symbol that was created in the setup phase of the dialog by SDK calls.<br/>
<br/>
The text object is moved after creation so its center matches the center of the circle, then it is rotated by 30 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
It looks fine if the plan is not rotated,<br/>
<br/>
but if the plan is rotated it becomes garbage. Both MoveObject and RotateObjectN do weird stuff depending on the plan rotation angle.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the symbol must look alike no matter if the plan is rotated or not.<br/>
<br/>
Below is the code that is used to create the sample. Just call function &quot;lm_dialog_testen&quot;. This will create and open the dialog.<br/>

Roofs continue to be problematic, now in new ways. In the attached file I have two instances of a roof object; one has a 2:12 pitch and the other is 1:12. The shingles render correctly on the steeper roof; but the texture is rotated 90° on the 1:12. The right-click &quot;rotate texture 90°&quot; option in the render tab of the OIP is broken, too.

The Customer is saving the Vectorworks Document on a server and that is causing the phenomena above described. When the Customer saves its locally this problem does not happen. Only if saved on the server.<br/>

An Export DWG from the attached source file leads to missing objects. The reason is the rotation of the SL-Viewport in combination with the crop.<br/>

Do you have any tipps for a work-ar-round? The attached files are  reduced samples of a complete BIM-project from one of our biggest customers. <br/>

The proper behavior can be seen the the classes pane of the org dialog.<br/>

IFC and DWG are better from a geometry point of view, though I can see some minor issues with the IFC as well, but Revit is way too inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
This customer is a presenter at one of our Global Design Days and we are working with them to improve their workflows so I would appreciate if you could have a look at this and find out what the problem is - is there an issue with the original Revit file and the way it was modelled, do we have some bugs importing or is it because of some settings? <br/>

Original report is for export as simplified graphics in the Model space, but problem appears when sheet layer is exported in the paper space too. Do not create separate files for the DLVPs.<br/>
<br/>
You will also notice, that when trying to open the file inside AutoCAD, an error message appears. Recovering shows, that we have a problem with a clipping block boundary. In fact, this is exactly the reason to see the objects on the upper right corner - block from the referenced file Kitchen.vwx is not properly clipped.<br/>

Referenced file UBS LO Master File Sections v2022.vwx is also attached. We could ask for all the other referenced files if necessary - [~dkudakauskas] has them.

When setting a workplane, using a planrotation and having a user origing. Selecting for example the windows door tool, the preview object gets an offset relative to the mousecursor inside the drawing. Using layerplane the draw the object workfine, also usng just a plan rotation without a workplane selection everything looks fine. It&#39;s just in this specific case.

It appears the same DWG imports just fine back in to Vectorworks as well. Not exactly sure if this is an issue on our end, but I figured it might be considering past versions of Vectorworks export the legends just fine.

Changing the options on Import Revit Entities as VW mesh objects, Groups of 3D polygons, VW solid objects do not help and the same problem happens in each one of these options.<br/>
<br/>
The issue happens when importing Revit Elements as Symbol or Revit Entity.<br/>
<br/>
The issue *does not* happen in Vectorworks 2022 SP6 (Build 679396).<br/>
<br/>
After importing it correctly to VW2022 and opening the v2022 file in VW2023, the ducts are still displaying correctly as after the import in VW2022.<br/>

In the enclosed file and movie you will see a rectangle, a Table and Chair PIO and a piece of Braceworks truss and a Spotlight Lighting Device.<br/>
<br/>
You will see that if the PIO Table and Chair and the rectangle primitive are selected you will see that described in the OIP. If their classes are made invisible so that they are no longer drawn on the page, the OIP immediately says &#39;No Selection&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
However if you do the same for the Truss and the Lighting Device so that they are not seen on the page they are still selected according to the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
If de-selected and a selection marquee drawn they can again be selected even though they are not visible on the page. This is quite dangerous as users might well want to make certain Spotlight and Braceworks objects invisible yet they could easily and unknowingly  delete or move things.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

The landscape area is sent to the surface of the site model in layer &#39;SM_site model ET&#39;, which seems to be problematic. Trying to update the site model hangs Vectorworks - this is issue VB-194094.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the Site Model Layer of the landscape area to &#39;SM_site model PT&#39; gives no errors for the landscape area geometry.

<br/>
It seems there is a problem with the Landscape Area Styles on this file.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When editing or replacing one of the styles, it seems to keep the contour of the landscape area shape but instead of filling it with the 2d colour of the style, it simply replaces it for some random white square shapes. (please see video attached).<br/>
<br/>
I tested this on Vectorworks 2023 SP3, SP4, SP5 and 2022 SP6 and the same thing happens. File is attached.

Change the settings (try increasing the max shape size or reducing the density) or make the stipple boundry smaller.&quot; - *But:* She has never used the Stipple Tool before and no Stipple objects can be found by looking or when using the &#39;Custom Selection&#39; command. <br/>
<br/>
The file exhibits other display and behavioural oddities: <br/>
 * The file can take a long time to open - presumably since this problem began.<br/>
 * The user reported leaving the computer overnight while it was simply opening this file but the process was not complete by the morning. I thought this may have been due to her computer running out of memory as it is very poorly spec&#39;d. - Her Windows laptop only has 6GB of RAM and when I connected via TeamViewer it was using 91% of this with only this file open and only a couple of other programs. <br/>
 * Some objects in the drawing were invisible but pre-selection highlighting showed they were there. <br/>
 * When I open her file on my well-spec&#39;d PC it memory consumption used a very high proportion of my free memory - about 18GB as I recall - but this went down when the processing had been complete. It&#39;s as if there _*is*_ a stipple object present, but it is not visible and cannot found using the Custom Selection command as seen in the attached screenshot. <br/>
<br/>
I checked this file on my PC but found no &#39;far out objects&#39; away from the drawing so I&#39;m wondering if corruption is at play or perhaps a rather specific Vectorworks bug. <br/>
<br/>
What to do from here?

Something about the single wall can&#39;t determine bounds maybe?

                Hardscape &quot;Fit to Surface&quot; Command Doesn&#39;t Fit Cleanly to Site Model
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Site Model and several modifiers on one layer, and a path-based Hardscape on another layer that has its &quot;Cut the Site Model&quot; option disabled and a Datum that&#39;s located at its bottom.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Change the Hardscape&#39;s layer to Design Layer-1<br/>
- Run the &quot;Fit to Surface&quot; command<br/>
- Update the Site Model<br/>
- Delete the Hardscape so you can see the Site Model geometry underneath<br/>
<br/>
Note that there are several areas of the Site Model where small pieces have been cut away by the Hardscape (see attached screenshots).<br/>
<br/>
In this case it seems like the Hardscape&#39;s modifier should be aligning perfectly with the Site Model surface, so that these areas don&#39;t get cut away.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2023 SP0.<br/>

                Project Sharing: possible issue with OneDrive (and SharePoint) and crash

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Setup information:<br/>
<br/>
Computer 1: Windows 10 on Intel iMac with bootcamp<br/>
Computer 2: Windows 10 on Dell laptop<br/>
both use Vectorworks 2023 SP3<br/>
both mount a SharePoint folder through OneDrive (v23.114.0530.0001)<br/>
<br/>
User 1 prepares the project file:<br/>
1) opens a vwx document (created in Vectorworks 2023)<br/>
2) saves copy on desktop<br/>
3) opens copy and create vwxp on desktop without creating a vwxw file<br/>
4) moves vwxp to SharePoint folder<br/>
5) opens vwxp to get the vwxw file and saves that on the desktop<br/>
<br/>
User 1 can now start working (check out objects, edit, commit changes, release objects...)<br/>
<br/>
User 2 opens vwxp to get a vwxw file and saves that on the desktop and can now work like User 1.<br/>
<br/>
When the first user commits changes, they can see that OneDrive is uploading the changed vwxp file and then the second user can see the changed vwxp file being downloaded. So good so far.<br/>
<br/>
Only when User 2 tries to commit changes, they start getting the following message:<br/>
<br/>
 (screenshot 01)<br/>
Do you want to Reset the Project File cloud version?<br/>
Vectorworks detected duplicate Project Files. Manually replacing or making copies of Project Files that use Cloud Integration is not supported.<br/>
<br/>
User 2 even had a crash after clicking &quot;Save and commit...&quot;. (logs and crash file are attached)<br/>
<br/>
When User 2 now deletes the vwxw file and tries to get a new one, they get the following message. (screenshot 02)<br/>
The cloud version of the project file has to be reset. How do you want to continue?<br/>
(Mind you: I couldn&#39;t find the original English title string for this message)<br/>
<br/>
Also: the customer never saw two files present in the SharePoint folder.<br/>
<br/>
I tested this setup with a colleague, but with DropBox instead of OneDrive and it worked like a charm. No messages about conflicts whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
The customer will test the Vectorworks Cloud solution for project sharing, but they would prefer not to have to use yet another cloud solution, because they fear their files being too wide spread over different systems.

                Graphic problems with new M2 MBP compared to same file on Intel iMac

I have done a screen share with the user and seen this, but they have also done a movie that I enclose. As you can see this interior designer when using her brand new M2 MBP with 32GB UM when navigating to the design layer in the [Area Details file] via the viewport and working away the objects do not draw. There is no external monitor.<br/>
<br/>
I can not repeat this on my M1 MBP 13.4 but I have 64GB UM. She has resorted to using a fairly underpowered Intel iMac to work. She says that it too sometimes doesn&#39;t draw but that it&#39;s still better than the new machine.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried the following:<br/>
Vectorworks Prefs: Turned off<br/>
* Accelerate graphics<br/>
* Use Vectorcaching for Faster Redraw<br/>
<br/>
Document Prefs: Turned Off<br/>
* Save VGM Graphics Cache<br/>
<br/>
Each time we closed and opened the document. Each time after a few operations the non-draw problem returned.<br/>
<br/>
I note that the files are simple although there are 8 Design Layer viewports in the Area Detail file and 16 in the file that is referenced. Those are not big numbers and is very common with Interior designers. The point of this report is that the M2 is worse than the Intel.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

<br/>
Once you had turned a .vwx file into a PDF in Vectorworks Cloud, you could open it in the NOMAD app and measure it. You could measure a distance or an angle on the snap points of the geometric objects in the scale of the respective section or view area. Currently, this no longer works. It is shown in NOMAD App that the snap points are loaded, but when you want to measure them, they are either not available or if you find snap points, they are not in the right place or offset to the 2D objects.<br/>

                New Mac Studio: Vectorworks crashes upon opening first time, second time launches fine.

<br/>
We have a user who has a new Mac Studio M1 Max 64GB UM.<br/>
<br/>
Each time he opens Vectorworks it crashes upon launch. The second time he opens it, the program is fine. <br/>
<br/>
He originally migrated from his old machine but we got him to uninstall and then do a fresh install, including a new user folder. Still the problem happens. I have included the crash log plus his .spx file. Note he has 3 screens:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Studio Display:* 14,745,600<br/>
 <br/>
*L27e-30:* 2,073,600<br/>
 <br/>
*LG HDR 4K:* 8,294,400<br/>
  <br/>
 +Total: 25,113,600 pixels+            <br/>
 <br/>
However I got him to unplug 2 screens only leaving the Studio Display plugged in, restart the computer and then try opening Vectorworks. The same thing happens - crash upon launch<br/>
He has since rebooted in Safe Mode and exactly the same thing happens. It might only be this user but I bug list this in case it reveals something important, plus it would be a better user experience if I could find a remedy for this user. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
SPX and log enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

I attached a crash log ... not sure if it helps, as it&#39;s a system report of me quitting Vectorworks.

I enclose a v2023 file and also the same file saved in v2024. Note that in the movie you can see that there are 3 x Data Visualisations relating via class the table and chair cloths. These should change the colour to black, blue or pink.<br/>
In the v2023 file they work fine yet in the v2024 file they only change to pink. As you can see the fill colours for the blue and black are correct but the render does not reflect this.<br/>

<br/>
Because it contains so much contextual detail, I&#39;ll quote here how a user described this problem to me in 28th of March, 2018. <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Often after I&#39;ve been switching between multiple open drawing tabs, my session will lock onto one of the open drawing tabs, and although I seem to have switched to the other (it becomes visible on the screen), anything I do with my mouse is still operating in the previous drawing. For example I will zoom with a mouse scroll and the seemingly open drawing will no respond but if I switch back to the previous drawing tab it will have zoomed as per my scroll. The only way to fix it is to close vectorworks and open it up again.<br/>
 <br/>
I discussed it with Bill and we hoped that the new graphics card would fix it, but it didn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t happen every session, but at least every two-three days and sometimes several times in one day. If you&#39;ve got any ideas, it might be an interesting challenge to fix.... No one else here seems to have the same problem and it doesn&#39;t happen in any other programs.&quot; - Sarah Ledingham. <br/>
Her colleague had the same issue a few months before she did too. I received other reports of this over the years but did not submit because restarting Vectorworks fixes the issue so I thought it was a fleeting glitch, but now I see that it is likely a bug. Another user - Mike Dowsett - contacted me about this last week and another user reported this to me in December too, so it&#39;s a good time to look at this. <br/>
<br/>
As I recall, this issue has been submitted by others before but as I can&#39;t see other user&#39;s submissions in Jira so I can&#39;t be sure. Have a look. <br/>
<br/>
*Also reported here:* <br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/93985-freezing-on-switching-between-documents/<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/77955-freezing-with-vectorworks-2020-on-windows-computer/<br/>
<br/>
*Please note:* <br/>
<br/>
Back in 2021 Joseph Block (SENIOR GLOBAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT MANAGER) said this issue had been reproduced by leaving Vectorworks open on a computer for days at a time. But this will not be the [only] cause because as the user quoted above points out, this has happened several times in a day and is fixed by restarting. It is very unlikely to be due to memory consumption because two recently affected users have 32 GB of RAM or more and the computers didn&#39;t exhibit any symptoms of insufficient memory. <br/>
<br/>
All reports I&#39;ve seen are on Windows computers. <br/>
<br/>
While assisting user Laura Cotterill (G0VLQ4) and while the issue persisted, we:<br/>
 * Tried quitting all other apps.<br/>
 * Tried unplugging all additional monitor/s.<br/>
 * Noted that the subject file/s had &#39;Legacy 2D Features&#39; enabled. <br/>
 * Noted each new document opened &#39;stole&#39; the UI focus. (See my screen recording attached). Symptoms include: <br/>
 ** Rulers no longer visible. <br/>
 ** Cursor does not change to reflect the selected tool, for some but not all tools. <br/>
 ** There is a notable delay between selecting a tool and the cursor/UI reflecting that change. <br/>
 * Noted that closing subsequently opened documents, returned UI focus to the next-most-recent document opened. <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that it is difficult to troubleshoot bugs if they can&#39;t be reproduced so I&#39;ve provided as much contextual info as possible to help isolate the code that might be responsible. There is lots of circumstantial info available about this issue available (read the Forum links I provided too) but I might have more than what is recorded here also, so quiz me if you have something in particular you wish to determine.

<br/>
Any ideas what can we do to help this Customer?<br/>
<br/>
As it seems, the Client installs (through Silent Installation) the 28.0.2 with Admin rights and the LDF is installed in the Admin User, other users that are not Admin cannot start Vectorworks because there is no LDF in their User, hence resulting in the License File Error.<br/>
<br/>
Is this known? If this is so, then it should be a general problem with any Client and Computer.<br/>
<br/>
The Customer has used the command that we have in our PDF:<br/>
<br/>

In Vectorworks 2023, any textures with a bump-map and a transparency will not be rendered in shaded. Textures with a bump OR transparency will do fine, but the combination prevents shaded from rendering anything. Kind of bothersome when working in a 3D Shaded view.

I believe it is linked to this old bug https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-187948 <br/>

Please can you have a look? as this customer (Starbucks) is worried about updating their files to 2023 now. <br/>

The issue is the same in 2022 as well. <br/>

All 6 users get a notification at random times during the day when they go into their own .vwxw file that the file needs to be updated. The problem is that they regularly get a notification from VW that the file needs to be updated. While this is not ordered by anyone. See shreenshot, this one is in Dutch. Here is the translation:<br/>

The Vectorworks Cloud Serviceses client did not contribute the local copy of the project file. The last update in the cloud was 20 seconds ago by buck on PERSPEKT_WS14. Wait for synchronization to complete or make sure the Vectorworks Cloud Services client is active.And all drafters participating in the Project Sharing file are affected.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The users at that time did not give an order in VW where an update of the model is needed. I understand that you can look in the log files. To see what is happening here, and why this message is coming up out of the blue.<br/>
If you tell me what information you need for this and where to find it. I will pass this on.

<br/>
I have not tested Python for anything other then pen foreground color, but it should be tested for all the attributes pushed/popped.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file there are three scripts Vectorscript Push/Pop, Python Push/Pop, Python Workaround.<br/>
<br/>
The two Push/Pop scripts do the same thing. Writes a line of text using the current pen foreground attribute, PUSHes the attributes, changes the pen foreground color, writes a line of text using this new color, POPs back to the original attributes, writes a third line of text.  The Workaround script accomplishes the same thing, but it manually stores and restores the pen color instead of using Push/Pop<br/>
<br/>
Open the file. Make sure the Pen Foreground color is set to black.<br/>
<br/>
Run the Vectorscript Push/Pop Script. You will get three lines of text with the first and last line in black and the middle line in blue.  This is the expected result of all three scripts.<br/>
<br/>
Run the Python Push/Pop script. You will get three lines of text, but the last two lines will be blue. The pen foreground color is not being restored by the vs.PopAttrs command. Notice that the pen color in the Attributes palette is now set to blue. You will need to set the default pen color back to black after running the Python Push/Pop script.<br/>
<br/>
Run the Python Workaround script. You will get three lines of text. Black/Blue/Black as expected. This tells me that the FPenFore command to get the pen color and the PenFore command to set the pen color are working correctly.<br/>
<br/>
The expected result is that PushAttrs and PopAttrs should function identically between Vectorscript and Python.  The Vectorscript behavior is correct. The Python should be corrected.

<br/>
The issue:<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks can cause a crash during launch because of &quot;out-dated&quot; windows firewall rules. Maybe it shows up more in support because of the new LDF file in Vectorworks 2023 that has to be created but that&#39;s just a guess. However, there is a solution to fix that by doing one of the 2 steps:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 # Delete or reset the Vw user folder. This cause Vw to re-create the firewall rule.<br/>
 # Delete the Firewall rule in the WindowsFirewall settings manually and re-launch Vw<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that these are actually easy solutions to solve the issue but it anyhow pops up as a support case that takes time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was asked by our support staff who want&#39;s to focus on &quot;real&quot; issues ti report that bug. The hope is that this issue can be fixed on the Vectorworks site during launch. Maybe a check if the firewall settings should be updated or not and avoid a crash.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I log a bug for it and maybe we can start the discussion about this here.

The attached movie shows this from a blank file.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * Insert a Structural Member and open its settings dialog<br/>
 * In the 2D Attributes list, expand the Pen Style or Fill Style menu for any part<br/>
<br/>
Note that this requires at least 3 clicks, one to set the focus on the part, the other to set the focus on the column, and another to open the menu.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac, this only takes a single click.<br/>
<br/>
List browsers do sometimes require an extra click on Windows to set the focus, but it seems like it should only take one extra click and not two.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other controls in the list browser (Class, Pen Color, etc) only require one or two clicks to access.

 # Result - Renamed tile is imported, but the imported symbols use the original &quot;Test tile&quot;.<br/>
 # Edited Symbol-3 to make sure.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the problem here is nested symbols.<br/>

This happens without project sharing as well.

<br/>
Client has attached its own record to an existing tree. And to show the value of the tree in a data visualization, he created a field with type &quot;number.&quot; When the value is displayed in the info palette as 13.440,00 the correct color from the data visualization is not shown. When we set the type to Text and enter the value as 13440,00 it is displayed as it should be.<br/>
So there is an error in how VW handles (./,) period and comma character in numbers.

I have a headlight assembly in the plan and want to move the fields to other positions. Works until I touch the field with slot group. As soon as I move that, User1&#39;s field jumps to the same position and I can only move them together? Any ideas what this could be due to? I also can&#39;t move User1 in principle, there is the little blue box missing.Video and file attached.

                TK BUG: After update to macOS Sonoma: Problems with Interactive Cursor
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
after my update to macOS Sonoma, I got problems with<br/>
the Interactive Cursor (IC). The various icons of the IC<br/>
are not displayed. After some work, the icons come back<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Both for VW 2023 SP7 and VW 2024 Beta Update 2.<br/>
The applications were installed before the update to Sonoma.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I can&#39;t replicate, what&#39;s causing the issue<br/>
and how to bring back the icons of the IC!<br/>
<br/>
Is this a known Bug, and/or more related to macOS or<br/>
Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>

<br/>
It is not possible to export the file attached (site model 3d mesh to revit.vwx) as Revit when the 3d style of the site model is set to mesh. It gets stuck in the first 10% or 15% of it as can be seen on the image attached (image 1). It won&#39;t allow to cancel the process and VW needs  to be forced to quit. <br/>
<br/>
However, if it is set to something else, for example extruded contours, it works just fine. <br/>
<br/>
Can you please take a look? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!<br/>

<br/>
When I want to insert a video screen in a new file I am unable to select one of the default projectors from the VW library. The drop down in the preference window remains empty.<br/>
<br/>
If I the try to insert the video screen anyway i get the following error message: &quot;Your attempting to create a model using parameters that are beyond limits. Please adjust lens settings or shift values&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The video screen after that does create without a projector. <br/>
<br/>
As a workaround I can solve the issue by importing 1 or more projectors in the file and then the video screen tool does see the projector in the drop down. <br/>
<br/>
I have seen this problemn in 2023 as well but know that this was never an issue before that. It seems as if the tool is unable to read the default projector file in Libraries&gt;Defaults&gt;video Screen.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This bug is 100% my bad. Term panels have more than one connected-to device and socket and at the moment we only see one of those. If only the left-hand side of the term panel is connected the Panel Connector displays the device/socket connected from the left, but the moment another device/socket is connected from the right the Panel Connector switches to show those. See attached file.<br/>
<br/>
Now the problem is that in the case of term panels we don&#39;t know which is the &quot;outward-facing&quot; side from looking at the schematic. Any port can be in input or an output and if it&#39;s an IO then without understanding the design as a human we cannot decide.<br/>
<br/>
In the old days I handled this by populating the upper text with the left device-socket and the lower text with the right device-socket. Leaving it to the user to edit the result to their needs.This wasn&#39;t great because most of the time there wasn&#39;t room for all that text.<br/>
<br/>
I think what we need is a by-instance toggle for Panel Connectors that are used in Term Panels to decide which connected-to device/socket is displayed. This can&#39;t be part of the style because it concerns the usage of the panel in a given system.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up for discussion about how best to resolve this.

<br/>
Open the Spanish version of Vectorworks 2024 (SP1 beta 2, for example).<br/>
<br/>
Open a blank file and place an elevator, which appears as Ascensor in the UI. Select the elevator and click Elevator Style. This appears as {color:#4c9aff}*_Estilo Ascensor_*{color}, which is incorrect because the string for this item is a concatenation of Elevator and Style. Thus the Spanish translations are also concatenated as Estilo + Ascensor.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, in the Elevator tool bar, we see the UI item {color:#4c9aff}*_Personalizado Ascensor_*{color}, which is a Spanish concatenation of the UI string Custom + Elevator. Both instances, 1 and 2 in the screenshot, are incorrect renditions and have a serious impact on localization.<br/>

*Recommendation:* please get rid of such concatenated strings and use full strings, such as Elevator style (see 1 as Estilo Ascensor in the screenshot) and Custom Elevator (see 2 as Personalizado Ascensor in the screenshot).<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * Select both Windows and open the settings dialog<br/>
 * Change the Jamb and Sash parts to use a by-Class texture<br/>
<br/>
Note that the change only gets applied to one of the objects.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to fail when going from:<br/>
 * By-Material to by-Class (the above example)<br/>
 * By-Material to None<br/>
 * By-Class to None<br/>
 * None to by-Class<br/>
<br/>
Other changes, for example when going from by-Class to by-Material or from by-Class to a direct texture, seem to work fine.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 29.0.0.

3) Scroll the mouse to the bottom edge of the screen. Under standard Windows behavior, this should reveal the taskbar but it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

I tested this on a desktop system with two screens, and this behavior occurred on the primary display but not when I moved the VW window to the secondary display. The behavior also occurred when I tested it on a laptop with only one display.<br/>

I set the &quot;above cut plane&quot; class to have a class override for that viewport. However, there are data visualizations applied to that viewport. One changes the hatches of slabs based on their style, and the other changes the hatches of wall components based on their layer and material. Neither of these data visualizations affect the particular class that is has the override, nor do they affect any objects outside their criteria. Therefore, based on what the help says, the class override should still be visible but it is not. The file is saved in multi view where one pane is looking the structural member in its design layer, and the other is looking at the viewport in question. If you turn off the data visualizations, you can see the class override appear.

<br/>
!image-2023-10-27-12-51-15-783.png|width=668,height=436!<br/>
<br/>
The functionality should be that if Class Texture is selected, regardless of if there is a Material applied to the component or not, that the Classes defined texture should automatically override and be visible. That seems to be why this option is even possible.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it doesn&#39;t work that way and the only way to get the class texture to show is to remove the material from the component altogether...therefore eliminating the ability to pull data from the materials if needed.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of our workflow is to still utilize materials and their inherent benefits, but rely on the class to do the 2D/3D visual lifting. This allows for more flexibility with finish/texture varieties without having to create unique styles for every finish/texture variety.

When in thumbnail views (both), a lighter blue is used, which is not the correct highlight colour, I think. it needs to be the darker blue (accent colour) plus inverted text.<br/>

<br/>
!image-2023-10-30-08-43-15-469.png!<br/>
<br/>
But the offset that is shown in the image is not the actual offset. The offset value required by the function actually appears to be the horizontal (along the dimension line) offset as a percentage of the line length.  There is no value in the LinearDim function that controls the offset of the text from the Dimension line.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ObjectVariableReal with an index of 43 control the offset of the text away from the Dimension Line. And a ResetObject is required after to have the change display.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, delete the two Dimension objects and run the only Vectorscript in the file.  The top linear dimension has a Text Offset of 0<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Both the HTML and Developer versions of the Function Reference need to be reviewed for the LinearDim function and corrected to display an image and words that actually explain what the function does.<br/>
<br/>
I have commented the Developer version of the function, but it should be edited so my comments are not required.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also recommend checking the documentation for AngularDim and CircularDim.  They both also have an Offset function and image that shows a text offset. I have not checked these functions, but I would not be surprised if they function the same way as LinearDim.

NVidia installs all apps using the Omniverse Launcher and apps are installed in a location unknown to the user.

<br/>
Since the &quot;Omniverse app&quot; isl ikely always installed in the same location - could we not try and connect to it automatically, instead of asking the user to specify its location?<br/>

<br/>
select the section viewport and click on the classes button to bring up this viewport&#39;s class properties.<br/>

Go to class Detail-Insulation. Notice it is visible. The rigid insulation on either side of the concrete foundation wall are visible.<br/>
<br/>
Close the viewport classes properties.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Classes in the navigation palette.<br/>
<br/>
In the navigation palette make the class Detail-Insulation invisible. <br/>
<br/>
Now ,on design layers , objects of this class will not be visible.<br/>
<br/>
Select Section A viewport again and update the viewport. Notice even though the class Detail-Insulation is set to visible in the viewport, objects of this class are not visible.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, no matter whether a class is visible in the viewport classes properties, the class visibility is overridden by the class visibility of the document.<br/>
<br/>
We have now lost control of class visibility within viewports.<br/>

Please, see the videos attached.<br/>
1. Windows does not show the name of the Line type, though it has a tooltip. <br/>
Mac does not show the tooltip, but it has a name next to the preview. <br/>
<br/>
2. Note, when the Pen does not have a Line style a random style name appears in the Line cell (possibly first available style in the resource selector). Preview shows a straight line if the type is &quot;Solid&quot;, and some random preview (dashed in the example) if the type is &quot;None&quot; or &quot;Pattern&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;Line&quot; cell should be empty in all these cases. Or at least for &quot;None&quot; and &quot;Pattern&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
3. When the Pen has some Line style the preview is correct on Mac, though the name of the style is not present. <br/>
On Windows the name sometimes is correct, sometimes does not update, and the preview is always a straight line.

To see how this goes in VW2024 SP1.1 I see that it only displays error messages. And shows nothing. Both in 2D and 3D. so the problem is bigger in VW2024 than in VW2023 SP7.

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
At the weekend I installed update 1 with a fresh user folder. Today Monday I opened up Update 0 and was having difficulty arranging my different versions of Vectorworks on different desktops as I have multiple for different programs.<br/>
When right clicking the app icon in the Mac Dock you get the options to have the app only in this desktop. I noticed that Vectorworks wouldn&#39;t play correctly with this. Sometimes I manually moved the 2024 window across the desktop so that it opened the next one but then when I got away from it and back again it had somehow jumped back to be &#39;on top&#39; of 2023 which was on the previous desktop.<br/>
Anyway after that I noticed that all the palettes has doubled... the tools don&#39;t work but the navigation seems to. A relaunch fixed it. My colleague has also seen multiple palettes.<br/>
I haven&#39;t played much with update 1.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

I&#39;ve got the Resource Manager alone at the top of the second monitor<br/>

I&#39;ve got 3 tabs of the Navigation Palette docked together, side by side.<br/>
<br/>
If I put them all in place (Set Up Like I Want.jpg  ) and then use the Menu Command &quot;Save Palette Positions&quot;, upon restart of VW, I end up with the navigation Palettes located on Screen #1, not #2 (EveryTime this happens.jpg) If the OIP gets attached to the Navigation Palette docked Tabs, it will shift location too. If each of the Navigation Palettes were not docked, they have memory.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve deleted the home folder thinking there was a corrupt prefs file. No Luck.<br/>
<br/>
This is not specific to 2024. It also happens with 2023. have not tested earlier than that.<br/>
<br/>
When did dockable palettes become possible?<br/>
<br/>
Have been living with this and had a moment to type this up for your review.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to file an Enhancement for this but, quite honestly, this should work.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you agree?<br/>

Thanks for reading to the end.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Select &quot;Building Shell&quot; tool set<br/>
 # Select &quot;Grid Line Tool&quot; <br/>
 # Click &quot;Grid Line Tool Preferences&quot; in the Mode Bar<br/>

Expected results: The &quot;Class Thickness&quot; item should have an arrow icon which also appears in the edit field if &quot;Class Thickness&quot; is selected.<br/>

Actual results: No arrow is present in the list or the edit field.

To reproduce, enable the Sill option for the Windows.<br/>

Note that this causes two of the components in the round Wall to show incorrectly. The fill colors fail to show in 2D and the components disappear completely in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
If you delete the in-wall Door, the problem will correct itself.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2023. The same thing happens going back to 29.0.0.

<br/>
Coincided with a support call I had yesterday with an Australian user with the exact same symbols. As you can see in the movie, you can not get past the Object Properties dialogue. No matter how long you wait.<br/>
<br/>
When you force quit it doesn&#39;t say that &#39;Vectorworks has stopped responding&#39; as it might usually say when hanging so there is no spinning wheel or actual crash but you have to force quit.<br/>
<br/>
I did a screen share with the user and reset the settings folder, relaunched, then the user folder to no avail. He said that it worked fine before he updated to SP7 so I will suggest he roll back and see if that fixes it.<br/>
<br/>
These are the L-Acoustics symbols.<br/>
<br/>
4 x K1-SB<br/>
12x L-Acoustics K1<br/>
4 x K2<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t send the Vectorworks file because I can&#39;t save it.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Looks like a minor interactive-sizing related ASSERT. Probably not harmful but still worth fixing.<br/>
<br/>
Create a rectangle or oval (probably any 2D object would do the same thing) and make a symbol containing it.<br/>
Activate the symbol and try to insert it in the document.

customer wants to switch from Vectorworks 2021 to 2023.<br/>
Before doing this, he did some tests.<br/>
One test was his template document with worksheets.<br/>
Those worksheets do contain formulas.<br/>
There is a dramatic loss of performance working with these worksheets, when for example prices oder pos. number get adjusted.<br/>
See my video.<br/>

</td>

The Door also has some Shim Gaps added to illustrate the issue.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in VW 2023 and VW 2024.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2023, note that the threshold extends only to the inner edge of the door jamb (see first attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2024, note that the threshold extends past the jamb to the edge of the wall opening. Also note that it fails to trim the jamb geometry (see second screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
If you enable the &quot;Threshold Under Leaf&#39; option in VW 2024 you then get the same result as VW 2023, so it&#39;s possible that this was an intentional change. If so, then the only issue is that the jamb geometry isn&#39;t getting trimmed (it intersects with the threshold geometry).<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 29.0.0.

3. Edit the Data Visualization. Note, the criteria string still has the old value (expected, we don&#39;t update Data Visualization criteria). Open the Criteria dialog. The field is empty. I think, expected, as such name does not exist. <br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Reported by Pascal:<br/>
<br/>
Using Patterns within Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At Design Express we have been asking for the removal of the patterns within the graphic features for a very long time because over time they usually cause more problems than benefits.<br/>
We often receive the message that these remain in order to be able to open older files that use patterns. In itself, I think that is an outdated argument. At some point, the choice must be made to send this to Legacy. By leaving the options in, the user will always continue to use them.<br/>
<br/>
It is therefore very annoying when we as support employees inform the customer that it is better not to use it. That way you get an endless discussion. If this is available in VW why am I not using it then taking it out?<br/>
<br/>
It is also time-consuming for the customer after we told him he no longer has to use this, to then search for all the patterns and replace them with a line hatching, motif of colour, for example.<br/>
<br/>
By way of argument, I have attached 2 “identical” files here. It is made with patterns, in the other all patterns have been replaced.<br/>
<br/>
What now appears if we publish these documents? When you publish the file with the patterns, you will see a very blurry PDF of the presentation layers where patterns were used.<br/>
If you publish the document without the patterns, the PDF will be sharp on all pages.<br/>
That&#39;s what the customer expected. So let this be an extra argument to finally omit the patterns within Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
A customer does not like to invest time and working hours without added value.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
You find here 2 files, one with patterns, and one without it.<br/>
Try to publish both and take a look at the PDF files. The file with patterns gives a very blurry PDF and that is not OK.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
See the files in the folder. It is placed in 2023 bugs, but it is the same in every version of Vectorworks

                                            <td class="description">      Vectorworks presents a problem in the display during &quot;Edit Edge&quot; of a polygon, which is particularly insidious because it leads one to think - on the user side - that there is a drawing error and in the geometries when instead it seems only a graphic rendering wrong effect.<br/>
<br/>
The edge of a closed polygon, during viewing or editing, doesn&#39;t meet with the real edge of the object and the &quot;rendered&quot; area follows the wrong editing edge instead of, as it should, the real edge of the object both in top/plan view (wireframe) and in top view (shaded). <br/>
<br/>
We have found that:<br/>
The problem disappears by breaking the polygon into lines<br/>
The problem sometimes disappears by reversing the direction of the polygon<br/>
The problem disappears by disabling the “Accelerate graphics” option in the General Settings - that I think is the culpict.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Colors may change when exporting files to older versions.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Open the sample file (Color.vwx) in Vectorworks2023.<br/>
2)Export the file in the previous version format.<br/>
3) Check the difference in color when opened in the version in question.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Vectorworks2023, when opened in the older version, the color is not brown (RGB value 86,44,5), but rather an earthy color (RGB value 86,72,59) with some gray mixed in.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
When the data created with v2023 was extracted from the previous version, we confirmed that the colors did not change significantly as in the sample file (Color.vwx), but the overall color tone changed.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to the following files.<br/>
The file in problem was created by selecting all the classic colors available in Vectorworks 2023,<br/>
Tools menu &gt; Utilities &gt; Create Color Palette.<br/>
 <br/>
[File name]<br/>
Compare Color3.vwx <br/>
Compare Color3_v2022.vwx <br/>
Compare Color3_v2021.vwx<br/>
<br/>
Compare Color_2023.png <br/>
Compare Color_2022.png <br/>
Compare Color_2021.png<br/>
 <br/>
In addition, the findings show the following situation.<br/>
2023→2022 Colors become slightly lighter (saturation decreases)<br/>
2023→2021 Colors become slightly darker (saturation increases)<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* We have confirmed that this problem occurs with all version exports.<br/>
<br/>
*Findings*<br/>
This problem clearly changes the color tone.<br/>
<br/>
The color tones seem to be different even for colors other than the color palette I created, and users have told me that they cannot use Vectorworks 2023 when this kind of problem occurs, so we think an improvement is urgently needed in the next SP.<br/>
<br/>

When I add two base accessories to a Lighting device, the 2D component of the lighting devices shifts away from the insertion point of the lighting device. You can see this in the screen recording: &quot;Base accesory Shift 2D&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I then edit accessories en move the base accesories away from center of the lighting device. The insertion point of the 3D component is shifted to the insertion point of the base accessorie. You can see this in the screen recording :&quot;Base accesory Shift 3D&quot;.<br/>

This is a problem that can result in big errors in a production and requires attention imho. <br/>

<br/>
GetTypeN() should return -47 for Sketch Style resources.<br/>
<br/>
Object Type 47 belongs to Record Formats.<br/>
<br/>
If you create a Resource Folder by script using BeginFolderN(47) as the folder&#39;s resource type, you will get a folder that only accepts Record Formats.<br/>
<br/>
To get a Resource Folder to accept Sketch Styles, you must create it with object type -47, as follows:<br/>
<br/>
NameObject(&#39;My Sketch Styles&#39;);<br/>
BeginFolderN(-47);<br/>
EndFolder;<br/>
<br/>
See attached VW file for some simple script examples showing the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Please fix the function GetTypeN() to return -47 for Sketch Styles, but PLEASE don&#39;t change the function&#39;s name. It was unnecessarily changed from GetType() to GetTypeN() in the past and it did not change basic functionality, nor did it require different inputs, while still returning all the expected values from prior VW versions.<br/>
<br/>
The number of scripts that will be affected if the name changes again is unthinkable. It would be better to not fix the function, than to fix it and change the name.<br/>

<br/>
A user has bought a new Mac Pro Studio &quot;M2 Ultra&quot; with two 27 inch displays. <br/>
Unfortunately, he has the problem in Vectorworks that the screens flicker black from time to time. Concerns Vectorworks 2023 SP 7 and 2024 Update 1.<br/>
<br/>
I find it special that only the drawing window flickers, the palettes do not. Any idea what that might be?<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
From User:<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a String node and a Point2 node. Attach them both to a Create Text node.<br/>
2. Duplicate these three nodes together so that you end up with four sets.<br/>
3. Name the String nodes &quot;1 String&quot; &quot;2 String&quot; &quot;3 String&quot; and &quot;4 String&quot;<br/>
4. Set the values of each Point2 value to something different so that the text objects won&#39;t be created on top of each other at the same location.<br/>
5. Connect all the Create Text nodes to a Pass node. This is just to connect them all into one network.<br/>
6. Right-click on any node and select &quot;Wrap Marionette Network...&quot; from the context menu. Name the wrapper something like &quot;string input test&quot;<br/>
7. Select the resulting wrapper node. In the PIO, enter text into the four input boxes that are all labeled &quot;String.&quot; You could simply enter &quot;1&quot; in the first box &quot;2&quot; in the second and so forth.<br/>
8. Run the wrapper node to test it. Four text objects should be generated that contain the strings you input.<br/>
9. Right-click on the wrapper then &quot;Convert to Object Node...&quot; The wrapper should change into a Marionette object that is the group of four text objects.<br/>
10. Select that Marionette object. In the style box of the PIO, select &quot;New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in...&quot;<br/>
11. Confirm the modal that asks where it should be located in the resource manager.<br/>
12. Confirm the default name. Enter your text examples in the four boxes labeled &quot;String&quot; again. **It seems like a another bug that the existing string values do not populate these boxes.**<br/>
13. Notice that the four text objects now all show the value of the fourth string. **This is a the buggy behaviour.**<br/>
14. Try changing the string values in the PIO. Only the fourth value is shown in the text objects.

- Edit the plant style<br/>
- Create a landscape area object<br/>
- Add the same plant to the landscape area, but (accidentally) form the library and not from the active document<br/>
<br/>
A duplicate of the plant style will appear in your active document without any warning. It will be the unedited plant style form the library which will be used for the landscape area.<br/>
This is dangerous, because the user doesn&#39;t know in this way that an unedited plant style is used. The user should get the usual resource name conflict dialog, which you also get when you import a resource manually.<br/>
<br/>
I report this as a bug, not an enhancement request because:<br/>
- This behavior can lead to mistakes in calculations because the user doesn&#39;t realize that an unedited version of the plant style is used<br/>
- Since importing resources in other ways trigger the name conflict dialog, it seems like the implementation of that dialog is forgotten with the design of the landscape area, and the design as it is now is not like that on purpose.<br/>
- If the user check the Resource Manager and sees duplicates he/she didn&#39;t make on purpose, it feels buggy to the user.

The DWG import is able to import the rendeworks textures correctly but we only get the color and not the texture images (realistic look of the furniture) in this case. We don&#39;t know if this should work or not. However, we would be super happy if you can take a look at the movie and documentation attached to give us a hint if this can be solved in a way.<br/>
<br/>
It might be that this issue is nothing that you need to address. But if we can get a SDK function or you can fix that on your side we really would appreciate and would make the tool even better and more useful for the customer.<br/>

I log this as low priority only because it is used for a development. But to us it is actually high because the tool would be much better.

                Project Sharing referenced Design layer viewport bug
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Just had Stefan Bahrawy reach out about a potentially major project sharing issue.<br/>
<br/>
He is having issues with referenced design layer viewport scaling in project files losing the viewport scaling in new working files. He has 6 referenced design layer viewports, 2 of which seem to be losing their scaling after the working file they were created in get committed in to the project file<br/>
<br/>
From the conversation I just had with him all the referenced files are DWG based, the 4 files that are working correctly are drawn in mm and the 2 that are causing problems are in meters (both from Capture).<br/>
Everything works correctly when he creates the referenced design layer viewports in the working file, the 2 Capture DWG&#39;s are correctly scaled. <br/>
However once the working files is committed and closed any new working files created from the master file do not have the correct scaling in the 2 of the referenced design layer viewports (the 2 from Capture).<br/>
<br/>
Follow up info from the Stefan, he hasn&#39;t tested if the manual update affects the issue as he&#39;s using the automatic update option.<br/>
But interestingly he changed his approach and instead of directly referencing the problem DWGs into the project he instead referenced the DWGs into shuttle files which were then referenced into the main project file and this seems to addressed whatever is causing the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached copies of the master project folder and reference (Xref) folder from Stefan. <br/>
THese files are highly confidential and should not be shared externally

<br/>
We have a company with 10+ users with one of their users facing a problem while using their Wacom Tablet to zoom in/out on Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
We tried several troubleshooting steps like repairing Vectorworks, Resetting their user folder, and making sure they had graphic drivers and the tablet drivers up to date but the problem still persists.<br/>
<br/>
The user mentioned that it takes a while for the problem to start happening and it does not happen as soon as they launch Vectorworks, which makes it difficult for us to see it happening in real-time, however, they provided us with a video showing the problem and the video is attached here. I am also attaching the user&#39;s DxDiag file and some screenshots they sent with a brief explanation.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to replicate the problem on my personal machine where I have a Wacom Intuos 4 tablet but it is not happening there.<br/>
<br/>
The Wacom tablet model they are using is {*}Wacom Intuos Pro M PTH-660{*}.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please have a look to the video and check if there would be any combination of keys or something else that could trigger that behaviour of their Design layer being dragged to the left while trying to zoom in and out using their tablet?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help.

Importantly .USDA exports when I change the extension to .txt there is nothing there other than the standard header. <br/>

USDA is the simplest for of USD because its human readable which is great for debugging. Currently I am getting very poor results with regular .usd exports with only things like the slab or walls exported. I do understand that this is in development so it doesn&#39;t effect me. <br/>

<br/>
A related issue occurs on Mac where dragging symbols from the Resource Manager into a Floating Pane simply does nothing. Confirmed in VW2023SP7 and VW2024U1. <br/>
<br/>
See the attached screen recording, but here are the steps: <br/>
 # Go: View &gt; Multiple View Panes &gt; Create Floating View Pane.<br/>
 # Drag a symbol from the Resource Manager into the Floating View Pane.<br/>
 # Try selecting and using another tool within any window. After it is used the &quot;Insert Symbol&quot; tool returns. <br/>
<br/>
The user asserted the only way to stop it is to restart Vectorworks, but I found that simply closing the document restored normalcy, which remained even after reopening the same document. <br/>
<br/>
If the Mac condition is not going to be addressed at the same time the Windows one is, please let me know so I know to submit a separate one for the Mac version.

To reproduce:<br/>
 * Run the File/Import/Import Sketchup command and import the file<br/>
 * In the import options dialog, enable the two checkboxes in the &quot;Import Materials&quot; section<br/>
<br/>
Note that the textures get applied to the imported objects as expected.<br/>
 * Now open another blank file<br/>
 * In the Resource Manager, expand the utility menu and choose &quot;Import Symbol (Batch)&quot;<br/>
 * Choose the same Sketchup file<br/>
 * Click the Options button and enable the same two &quot;Import Materials&quot; options<br/>
<br/>
Note that the textures get created, but they fail to get applied to the imported objects.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this problem with other file formats like OBJ or 3DS.<br/>

This feature was broken on Mac prior to 29.0.2, but the same thing happened on Windows in VW 2023.

<br/>
I have schematic panel devices linked to a layout.<br/>
<br/>
Unstyled Panel<br/>
 * If I override the display tag of a connector, this will be cancelled and reset to the Linked Socket name if I use &#39;Update from Schematic&#39;. (ideally these should know they were manually overriden from the socket name and resist this change)<br/>
 * But if I also change the name of the linked Schematic device at all (doesn&#39;t matter what), the display tag is no longer reset and retains the new display tag - even though the Linked To Socket is incorrect and still linked to the previous socket name.<br/>
<br/>
Styled Panel<br/>
 * This behaviour is similar but a little different. If I change a display tag in the Style, exist the style and Update From Schematic, it will revert to the old label externally, but upon editing the style again, the change has stuck and is shown, but is not shown outside of the panel edit mode whenever the Update From Schematic button is pressed.<br/>
 * As above, if I also change the name of the linked Schematic device at all (doesn&#39;t matter what), the display tag is no longer reset and retains the new display tag - even though the Linked To Socket is incorrect and still linked to the previous socket name.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve spoken before that the Update From Schematic button could be viewed or expected to update the Linked To Socket when schematic devices are renamed, and we&#39;ve discussed whether a separate button provides that function instead. But at the moment, it doesn&#39;t actually touch the Linked To Socket but does affect the display tag, which can be confusing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Can I just say; despite the tickets and discussion today, I think Update 2 for Panel Layouts is great in general and I think it is going in a good direction.

See attached testfile.<br/>
When site modifier is applied to proposed site model, then the slope is steep as it should be. But when the site modifier is applied to existing site model, then the slopes are not steep any more.<br/>
According to my understanding, the behavior of a site modifier should be the same with existing and proposed site model. So I think this is a bug?<br/>
If it is a bug, pleas fix it.<br/>
If it is works as designed, then please tell me about the different behavior.

Perhaps the bounding box needs to be checked to see if the &quot;Show Symbols&quot; box is checked or not before resetting the text column widths.<br/>

<br/>
They began the project in VWX 223 and then upgraded to VWX24 with no luck in fixing the window issue.<br/>
<br/>
Noticing the issue in Rotated Top/Plan view at the moment<br/>
<br/>
This is a Project Sharing File.<br/>
<br/>
Creating a custom slightly recessed window with a 125 mil offset. The user is setting up windows styles. Offset of the window in the wall has moved to the object info styles.<br/>
<br/>
When he does an interior reveal there is a gap between the window and the material that is exactly the distance of the offset<br/>
<br/>
Using the window tool setting, edit style setting interior wall details with no luck<br/>
<br/>
He wants to wrap one component into the window but when he sets the interior components to &quot;1&quot; the green line that indicates wrapping offsets from the edge of the window. He does not want the green line to look non continuous.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notes from the user <br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like the interior component texture to fully wrap into the window reveal so that it meets the window. I have previously used this tool very successfully and I can&#39;t understand what&#39;s gone wrong since I last tried it. I&#39;ve just tried it in a blank file and I&#39;m having similar issues. That&#39;s the only window I have identified so far but it&#39;s also the first window I have looked at. I also tried it in another blank file with just a simple brick cavity wall and our basic window style and I got a similar issue. The goal is to get that window working so that the plasterboard returns fully into the window and then roll this out to the other windows. This used to be achievable using the interior and exterior wall detail settings in the window settings menu but it doesn&#39;t seem to be working now.&quot;

<br/>
a customer of us always puts his site modifiers into symbols. I don&#39;t know if this is the intended workflow or if this only worked accidentally.<br/>
Well, since Vectorworks 2023 and the reengineering of site modifiers this does not works any more.<br/>
If this is a bug please fix.<br/>
On the other hand this behavior was not intended and only worked accidentally. Then please tell me so I can tell the customer.<br/>
<br/>
See video and testfile.<br/>

In 2023 the same symbols fail to grade the site, I assume this results from grading changes to the software for 2023. Return of this functionality would be helpful as I&#39;m developing a library of pool symbols which are more useful if they can excavate a site, when placed on a site model. Currently, I&#39;m able to create a symbol with the pool, and an additional symbol with the pool and a group of site modifiers, but the symbol has to insert as a group, in order for the modifiers to properly function.

<br/>
To reproduce, click-drag the SM while holding down the Option key (CTL on Win) to duplicate it.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the object checkout dialog appears.<br/>
<br/>
If you duplicate with the Duplicate command or one of the duplication tools, the checkout isn&#39;t required.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem with other object types.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2023. The same thing happens going back to 29.0.0.

When rendering while using a custom renderworks background on the designlayer(Renderworks renderings), the objects/buildings get a strange coloured outline. This doesn&#39;t happen in VW 2022.<br/>

Steps to reproduce: Open attached file or open a file with objects. Change renderworks background to a custom background. While in the designlayer, set the rendering to a renderworks render (Renderworks fast, Renderworks final etc.)

There appears to be a redraw problem or some unknown problem with slab drainage. In the test file, the slab drainage doesn&#39;t appear properly after insertion. This is visible in plan and 3D views. Sometimes this gets corrected if you open and close the &quot;Slab Drainage Settings&quot; dialog. <br/>

An exception to this rule are the symbols from the next library:<br/>
<br/>
Site- Landscape- &quot;in-lite landscape.vwx&quot;. Whenever you import a light source from this document into the active file, this light source doesn&#39;t emit light. The light source is checked off by default in the visualization palette. This is confusing to the user and it is usually not immediately clear to them why the light source is not immediately emitting light.<br/>

This issue needs to be fixed in that library file.

we received point cloud file from surveyor with 4 reference points in global coordinates.<br/>
First misconduct:<br/>
Point cloud is imported sliced. Even if the file is geolocated, it will still be imported cut up. The import only works correctly if you import the point cloud on Internal Origin.<br/>
Second Misconduct:<br/>
Point cloud is always imported offset about 11-12 centimeters, even if the file is geolocated.<br/>
As a counter-test, the file was imported into QGIS, the coordinates match.<br/>
See video: Movie_Import Point Cloud Object.mp4<br/>
Please have a look, our VIP customer works a lot with point clouds<br/>

<br/>
the symbol should be used to edit the wall to make it thinner in a certain <br/>
area along the entire length of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The bug occurs if you have 2D components in the overlapping symbol.<br/>
<br/>
BUG = symbol cannot be scaled to entire wall length.<br/>
The symbol overlaps the wall on one side and a gap is<br/>
created at the other end of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
If you delete all 2d components except the loci,<br/>
you can use the symbol over the entire wall length<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Information to the symbol = symbol hybrid 1<br/>
2D components = only and some lines<br/>
3D components = 3D locus<br/>
Wall hole component = cube with 1 x 1 x 1 cm<br/>
<br/>
Information to the symbol = symbol hybrid 2<br/>
2D components = only loci<br/>
3D components = 3D locus<br/>
Wall hole component = cube with 1 x 1 x 1 cm<br/>
<br/>
For Top/Plan view, it is necessary to have 2D components in the symbol!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>

<br/>
Pasting during text edit changes the text size of the pasted content on Windows.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Set global text to Arial, style plain text, size 11 pt.<br/>
 # Create a new text object and type the word &quot;test&quot;<br/>
 # While still editing, select the word &#39;test&#39; and copy with ctrl-C<br/>
 # Move the cursor to the end of the text field, and paste with ctrl-V<br/>
 # Now move the cursor into the text you just pasted and check text attributes in the OIP<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the pasted text has size 11 pt, same as original <br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the pasted text has size 10.4 pt<br/>
<br/>
This is not a regression, it was there in VW2021. Windows only.

In fact, the opacity of this object doesn&#39;t influence the general site model&#39;s opacity, which you can now define in the OIP.<br/>
This OIP seems to be useless and probably is not supposed to be seen in the UI.<br/>
It&#39;s also not documented in the user help and it&#39;s contained in the one-string file:<br/>
Landscape &gt; ExtObjSiteModelOpacityContainer.vwstrings &gt; SiteModelOpacityContainer<br/>
Moreover, the T02383 doesn&#39;t mention it either.<br/>
<br/>
Does it work as designed?<br/>
If so, could you tell me what it is and why it mentions the &#39;site model opacity&#39;?<br/>

In the enclosed movie and file you can see that in v2021 when the Reshape/Edit Contours is used there are handles to grab. In 2023/4 these do not appear. (I realise why the handles are white in v2021 as I&#39;m on another layer other than the DTM layer).<br/>
<br/>
Yet in a virgin new DTM the handles look great. There is a forum post about this and this is the user&#39;s file enclosed.<br/>

the stake object does not display as fractional—it displays as decimal inches. Although landscape designers/architects usually use decimal feet for grading, it is important for users who use traditional methods of measurement for grading to be able to display elevations as fractions.

<br/>
a bug occurs if you have an overlapping symbol in a wall<br/>
and you move the wall with the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
BUG = symbol will be deleted!<br/>
<br/>
If you move the walls with the Move command (Modify / Move)<br/>
the symbol will not be deleted!<br/>
<br/>
If the symbol does not overlap the wall and you move the wall<br/>
with the mouse, it will not be deleted either.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Information to the symbol = hybrid symbol<br/>
<br/>
2D components = loci and some lines<br/>
3D components = 3D locus<br/>
Wall hole component = cube with 1 x 1 x 1 cm<br/>
<br/>
The symbol is used to edit the wall to make it thinner in a certain<br/>
area along the entire length of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
There is a 2nd. Bug with symbols in walls (I make a separate report for this)<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>

3. Select the locked rectangle and hit cmd+d. (It should have a grey selection box, indicated it is indeed locked)<br/>
<br/>
4.  It won&#39;t look like anything happened but you&#39;ll find if you unlock (right click, unlock) the rectangle,  there are now two rectangles.   The base one,  which is still locked,  and the duplicate that is now unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
I often lock a venue symbol/viewport/group/etc into place when designing,  and it&#39;s super easy to still inadvertently select the locked venue object when duplicating (via any of the usual duplicating capable tools) something else entirely.    And eventually ending up with 10+ copies of the base venue plan beneath and all that added geometry slowing the whole file down.   But you don&#39;t realize they are even there.<br/>
<br/>
If an object is indeed locked,  by definition you should not be able to interact with it, with any tool,  without first unlocking.<br/>

To reproduce follow these steps:<br/>
Open the attached file (DataSmith Community Center Test 2022.vwx)<br/>
In the Visualization toolbox select &quot;Datasmith Direct Link&quot; (the unreal icon)<br/>
Export file to any local folder.<br/>
when previous step is done click the Direct Link icon<br/>
Optional: open twinmotion and load the scene<br/>
Made some changes like moving the statues around or the lights<br/>
Disconnect by clicking the Direct Link button again<br/>
Close the VW file, <br/>
Select Vectorworks -&gt; Quit Vectorworks<br/>

The MVR was originally created in Wysiwyg and includes custom generated GDTF filesfrom Wyg.<br/>

In SP0, note that the selection highlighting matches the profile shape exactly (see first attached screenshot).<br/>

Especially in that case the command would be really fantastic. We also realized that the command works reliably for smaller meshes. Therefore we think there is a limitation and the issue only occurs for huge meshes.<br/>
<br/>
However, for one off our developments we depend on this feature in some cases. It would be fantatstic if you can watch the movie and try to optimize simplify mesh command working with big meshes too. (without breaking what you have already :))<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # See attached movie<br/>
 # Open &quot;Testfile 20230823_02&quot; to reproduce the problem<br/>
<br/>
If you start simplify the mesh you can see that the slider has more or less no influence. The mesh will be reduced in a way that it cannot be used at all no matter how the slider is set.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Because of our ongoing development it would be fantastic if you can check if this feature can be optimized for large meshes too.<br/>
<br/>
We hope it&#39;s a low hanging fruit and a internal limitation of the tool :)

After having some more experiences with styled Scripts. I excpected that the style would be something on the level of a symbol or a bulletproof hull wich contains the script and not rewrap new by copy/paste the style as example. Near copy/paste we have many of other functions or workkflows which could go through such a Marionette style and can potentially wreck the script.<br/>
My notion was, that style-script is wrappend, cached and attached to the style. And nothing (even deleting some of the graphical representation from outside (with a tool, a bug, a workflow, a simple script, etc.) would be able to destroy it except the exit button of the style itself (the user).<br/>
<br/>
Does the New Style and Script-Instancing Task should address this issue by design? <br/>
The Question is very important because of that information we have to inform our customer if Marionette PIOs should be used in big projects or not.<br/>

1. The same Script as a styled version. The Message and AlertDialog shows also the right Layer and the right collected pio handles. <br/>
2. After Reset, the  PIO on the layer are not resetted. I think because of the style, somewhere (to fix another issue) they are prevented from resetting.<br/>

                Editing Linked Renderworks Camera Causes Render Process to Stay Active Indefinitely

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Viewport with a linked RW Camera.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * Enter the Viewport&#39;s Camera edit mode<br/>
 * Click the Fine Tune Camera button<br/>
 * Change the render mode to Hidden Line, and make some view changes<br/>
 * Now change the mode to Shaded<br/>
<br/>
Note that a render process is now active, and will remain stuck in that state.<br/>
<br/>
If you switch to the design layer and then back to the sheet, the render will cancel.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be related to Hidden Line. You can see the same thing if you set an RW Camera&#39;s render mode to Hidden Line and then create a linked Viewport from it. When the sheet becomes active with the new Viewport, a render process will be active.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2023.

There&#39;s one wall which does look very strange, though, but if I replace this (corrupted) wall, it is still not functioning.<br/>
I first need to fix another issue, where two walls are placed slightly off axis, before I can make it work. I think it shouldn&#39;t be necessary to fix this, since Vectorworks should be smart enough to recognize an enclosed space despite the walls being slightly off axis.

On the source page VW does not actually rotate the visible detail viewport geometry so it looks like it should, a mirror of the original detail viewport.  However, on the sheet where you place the new detail viewport the crop will be rotated.  <br/>
<br/>
This rotation only occurs when using the mirror tool.  If you edit the mirrored detail viewport geometry before you turn it into a detail viewport VW will not rotate it.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the desired result is that VW should not rotate anything.  Using any tool to copy a detail viewport should allow the user to turn it into a new detail viewport without any change to the boundary geometry.<br/>

<br/>
We have a user who always gets a blank home screen.  So far we&#39;ve tried and checked the following:<br/>
 * Reset the User Folder<br/>
 * Checked if there was any antivirus or firewall on the computer<br/>
 * Tried another internet connection<br/>
 * Did a full uninstall/reinstall of Vectorworks<br/>
 * Did a full uninstall/reinstall of Vectorworks Cloud Services<br/>
 * Logged out, wiped the User Folder and the &quot;Accounts&quot; folder, then logged back in<br/>
<br/>
We still haven&#39;t been able to figure out why this is happening and I&#39;ve included a screenshot and a system report from the user.<br/>
<br/>
This issue has occurred for them in both 2023 and 2024 and it happened even with a clean install of 2024 (no migration).  Any thoughts are appreciated and have a great day!  :)

<br/>
I know what the issue is here - the offset amount is exactly equal to a RoundWallOffset value by which the Door/Window shifts all of its geometry after creating it. The problem is that the Sill/Threshold is flush with the wall face prior to this shift.<br/>
<br/>
So it needs to do something like shift the wall envelope, temp hole geometry, and sill geometry in the opposite direction before using it to create the 2D sill/threshold geometry.<br/>
<br/>
But I think Judah&#39;s the best one to work out the exact way to fix it.

Note that the Railing can be selected if you click anywhere on its geometry, but it only shows selection highlighting on the linear part of the handrail&#39;s path (not including the terminations). In Shaded mode this makes it hard to tell that the Railing is being selected.<br/>

If you Ungroup the Railing into a Generic Solid, the highlighting shows fine.<br/>

The transfer of Face Items works well with the Eyedropper tool, so it seems like Create Similar Object should work too. This might be more of a wish though, so if it needs to be converted to a VE- report just let me know.

<br/>
Just noticed the tool sets icons get migrated from previous versions when the workspace is migrated to 2024. <br/>
<br/>
Should it not use the new icons on VW2024? <br/>
<br/>
To replicate this, create a custom workspace in 2023 and then use the migration manager to migrate that workspace to 2024. Note how the tool sets icons are still from 2023. Image attached. <br/>

The result is, that these landings are also missing in sheet layer section viewports.<br/>

When opened in Vectorworks 2024 it seems that all slabs are visible. Whether or not that was a fix or merely occurred due to the conversion is a question for later.<br/>

The question for now is: can you find out what the issue is with these slabs (with modifiers)?<br/>

After opening the drowndown menu with more options, its not possible to close it back if no options from the menu are selected.

Note that this works fine in Wireframe.<br/>

1. duplicate props into another class and delete the 2D representations there.<br/>
2. export remove and undo.

“Merge with Structural Objects in Sections” won&#39;t work as expected<br/>
with “Shaded View”-Rendering.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes 3D-objects merge, sometimes 3D-objects won&#39;t merge.<br/>
<br/>
Some 3D-objects never merge: “Extrudes” for example, or Subdivisions!<br/>
“Generic Solids” merge if the tool works as expected, but often “Generic Solids”<br/>
won&#39;t merge.<br/>
<br/>
Please fix this behavior for “Generic Solids” + please enhance VW<br/>
that every 3D-object can merge!<br/>
<br/>
Attached, you find a demo-file + a video!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Tobi

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Place a default Structural Member and open its settings dialog<br/>
- In the Attributes pane, highlight multiple items and then try to expand one of the pulldown menus by clicking on the small arrow next to it<br/>
<br/>
Note that this is possible, but only if you click in a very specific place. If you&#39;re even a little bit off, it&#39;ll treat the click as a new selection and everything else will become un-highlighted.<br/>
<br/>
When only one item is highlighted, the user can click anywhere in the column (on the arrow or the text string) and the pulldown menu will open. Ideally that would also work with multiple items.<br/>
<br/>
This also affects the other browser columns that don&#39;t use pulldowns. For example the pen/fill color swatches and the &quot;Show&quot; checkmarks only work if you click exactly in the middle of their graphics.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 10 I can&#39;t get multiple-item editing to work at all (reported separately in VB-197456).

Pipe and Drape 21&#39; x16&#39;, though, reports accurate counts in the symbols and part and inventory tab and can be properly assigned. <br/>

Accurate counts seem to track of sub parts like sliders, bases, and uprights.

I have a Data Visualization which does not include walls (&quot;by Parameter Slab&quot;).<br/>
When the viewport is updated for the first time walls look correctly.<br/>
Now apply a Data Visualization which include walls (for example, &quot;by Function (class)&quot;).<br/>
Appearance is correct.<br/>
Now apply &quot;by Parameter Slab&quot; again. Note, walls keep the color from the previous Data Visualization.

<br/>
One of our users has come across an odd sequence which breaks a hardscape. If you set up a material with a Tile fill and apply this to a component of a hardscape. Then for the 2D fill of the hardscape set this to the same tile. Edit the tile to have no background fill. Then change the 2D fill within the attributes palette to none so it just shows the line work. The 3D of the hardscape breaks. <br/>
<br/>
If you do this process without the material it all work ok. It also starts working if you change the material to have a different fill and then back to the tile. However this then breaks again a little time after. <br/>
<br/>
Please find a video of this issue. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need anymore information <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes <br/>
<br/>

Note that the door stiles show the texture horizontally instead of vertically, and that this depends on the height of the door. With some heights the textures show fine (ex: 30&quot; height), and with others either one stile will incorrectly (ex: 40&quot; height) or both stiles will show incorrectly (ex: 36&quot; height). Screenshots are attached.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this problem with Shaker Frame drawers or with Mitered Frame doors.

I can get the window with trims to cut multi-component walls as I desire but as soon as I turn on the &quot;Sills&quot; everything gets screwed up.  Attached are a couple of screen captures that describe the problem more clearly.  This seems like a glitch that has never been addressed.  Or perhaps I&#39;m doing something wrong?<br/>

The polyline to make the extrusion uses fillet point mode to make the large curved portions, so the control points are way off to the left of the polyline, which essentially makes the viewport larger.

 # Notice nothing happens <br/>
<br/>
If there is a truss of the same type in the drawing that is not a Hanging Position, Edit Selected will populate the Properties window. (As seen in video)<br/>
<br/>
If the Hanging Position is created as a symbol, the system shows (not the truss type) and the Edit Selected is not active. (T2 System in Drawing &amp; Video)<br/>
<br/>
I am not complete sure how this is expected to work, just might be confusing for users?

The enclosed snapshot shows what 2023 is like and as you can see in the mode bar the help that &quot;Use the Command Key to Select Objects&quot; is missing.<br/>
This piece of information is such an important one as it allows users to remain in that tool(s) and carry one working. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if there are other tools that also use this but please bring this back it&#39;s very important!<br/>

So maybe there is something wrong with the Undo behavior, as in this files the complete style is deleted.

<br/>
if you want to draw a 3D-Polygon and click on the tool-icon,<br/>
the view will switch to Top-View.<br/>
<br/>
If you draw now a 3D-Polygon with only two Vertices, the 3D-Polygon use the Fill-setting as Pen-color and not the Pen-setting as Pen-color.<br/>
<br/>
If you switch to Top-Plan-View, the Pen-color will be shown as defined<br/>
in the Attribute Palette.<br/>
<br/>
A 3D-Polygon with more than two vertices, will be shown as defined.<br/>
<br/>
/ / / <br/>
<br/>
It would also be fantastic if we can define Pen-Colors for 3D-VIEWS<br/>
with the Attribute Palette. At the moment, this isn&#39;t possible.<br/>
Hope we get this opportunity in the future.<br/>

<br/>
Currently, if you click that button with an object selected, it brings you to the browser which is confusing. If you choose a different object, then the text information of the selected object may change, but not the drawing representation, which is even more confusing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is this an issue with the help, or is this an issue with how the mode is working? <br/>
<br/>
I think this mode should just check for updates and not allow user interaction.

{*}Edit{*}: I took a closer look at this and noticed the main wall hole geometry stops short of the bottom of the jamb by 1/2&quot; (the Top Gap value).  This leaves a gap in the solid addition (used for the wall hole) between the main hole and the hole for the sill.

<br/>
When we have an urban plan, there is often a 2D background here. Like Polygons and Polylines, a building can sometimes be a simple extrusion. In this way a client wants to give a quick impression of what the urban area will look like.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am not getting good results in VW2024 SP0 either. When no 3D surface is present, the 3D objects seem to float. This is because VW2024 but also VW2023 projects the shadow a meter below the 3D object. This makes it totally unusable and gives a wrong impression.<br/>
<br/>
When we place a 3D extrusion under the GIS info and have it on, the shadows are shown correctly. But this is not always desirable or possible.<br/>
<br/>
I made a video showing this. Also, the file has been added as a VW2024 file.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Issues I am having such as:<br/>
 * Symbols in a scale factor of 0.0025<br/>
 * !image-2023-08-31-14-45-57-502.png|width=237,height=176!!image-2023-08-31-14-41-32-776.png|width=530,height=200!<br/>
 * Exploded 3D symbols<br/>
 * !image-2023-08-31-14-49-51-067.png|width=262,height=219!<br/>
 * Dimensions in enormous length/distance<br/>
 * !image-2023-08-31-14-51-24-618.png|width=524,height=323!<br/>
 * Slow File<br/>
 ** The CAD file was 14MB, and I can easily navigate in Trueviewer. However, the CAD import to Vectorworks file is 10 times its size very slow to move around, and crashes often.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*File import*<br/>
<br/>
The plot layout in the CAD file is created with symbols.  I use 1 = 400 DXF/DWG units (1:400 in millimeters) for import to have the drawing in the correct scale in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-08-31-14-15-39-174.png|width=483,height=113!<br/>

I look forward to hearing from you, on what I can do to improve the import process,<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

In schematic drawing it&#39;s normal to have only snap-to-grid on as this helps make sure objects are not placed unintentionally off-grid. However, this setting forces the tool point to the nearest grid point and this can make it hard to pick parts of objects that happen to be off-grid.The work-around is to enable snap-to-object also but this can result in objects straying off the grid again. This isn&#39;t specific to the ReRoute tool.

When inserting Laubwerk Plants into a drawing, the current 3D Geometry on the drawing is being affected by a crop. It looks like an invisible &quot;clip cube&quot; which crops the edges of the geometry.<br/>
<br/>
When you orbit around with the Flyover Tool, you can notice that the crop stays in the same position, as if it is in screen plane.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tested this in 2024 on both MacOS 12.6 and Windows 11 and it behaves the same way on both OS.<br/>
<br/>
Please find a video attached showing the problem on MacOS 12.6

                Model gets &quot;cut away&quot; when a railing or flyover tool (or perhaps any other tool) is activated
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I realize this is going to be a somewhat vague one, but it *keeps* happening to me with the attached file so I wanted to get it into JIRA for good measure...<br/>
<br/>
At seemingly random times, when I am in a 3D view and I activate a tool, the model instantly appears &quot;cut away&quot; and continues to &quot;morph&quot; in a cut away state. (In may case, the tools that have been activated as this occurs are the railing tool and, as seen in the video, the flyover tool - invoked by my 3DConnexion Spacemouse.)<br/>
<br/>
Rendering the model in its current mode - Shaded - Does not solve the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Rendering the model in Wireframe and then back to Shaded, does not solve the issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried saving the file, closing, and reopening the file, and that has only resolved the issue once or two, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Typically what I must do is fully quit Vectorworks and relaunch it, then reopen the file. Then the issue usually does not occur again for a few hours, but sometimes it occurs again within a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Other info:<br/>
 * My computer is rebooted daily, at least.<br/>
 * A system report is also attached in case it&#39;s needed.<br/>
 * When the issue occurs, typically I am not running anything else graphically intensive or requiring lots of RAM.<br/>
 * This has been occurring randomly during during the beta cycle of 2024. I am entering the build number where I last saw the issue below. I download a new build daily.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to get in touch with me if you have any additional questions of want me to try anything in particular to help troubleshoot this issue.

<br/>
Likely an issue with how the VWApp.Text API applies text changes to objects, somehow not including text-along path.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a one-line text object with some text, and a bezier path, then combine them with the Text-&gt;Text Along Path command.<br/>
 # With this object selected, click different style buttons (B, I, U) in the view bar<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the styles are applied to the selected text-along-path object<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the object is not changed, even though the buttons in the view bar toggle<br/>
<br/>
Note that Bold, Italic, Underline work on the object as expected from other controls (OIP, Text-&gt;Style menu, dialog).<br/>
<br/>
Also note that other view bar controls like Font and Size work properly on the object.<br/>
<br/>
Marking as not a regression because this is a new UI, but it is a regression in terms of expected behavior of bold/italic/underline controls generally.

(1) the current limitation is the fact that you can not have a different line type for viewed jamb and cutter jamb.

<br/>
Note that the window trim extends along the top and sides of the window, as appropriate. However a portion of the trim is also extended between the bottom of the window and the top of the window sill. When viewed from the exterior, there is trim visible beneath the bottom of the window, and above the sill.<br/>
<br/>
This is not correct general practice. The sill should extend in from the exterior toward the window sash, with the sash (or in some cases the window frame) sitting directly on the sill.  This is actually shown correctly in the image used for the window settings dialog diagram.<br/>

<br/>
If you create a ramp using a model into the resource selector, it is impossible to get shaded or textured render mode for the object.<br/>
If you create the same ramp using the default preferences dialog box THE FIRST TIME, shading or texture can be applied.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems that it is just for the FIRST ramp created using dailog box only, instead resource manager.<br/>
If you re-create a new ramp using the preferences dialog box a second time, no shading and no texture are rendered, like with the resource manager mode problem described prevously.

<br/>
Crashes seem to be at shutdown, due to attempting to use the SDK to clean up texture properties after the SDK has been destructed. It is unclear why the texture properties have not been cleaned up beforehand as we would expect. Further investigation is needed to determine what needs to be done to ensure the texture properties are properly cleaned up before the SDK is destructed in all cases.

                Spotlight Braceworks duplicated items a not aligning along truss properly

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the attached video, I show adding a single speaker to a truss. Duplicated speakers do not snap to the same chord as the original. This issue also occurs when utilizing the Move by Points tool and specifying the number of duplicates. The first duplicate aligns correctly with the truss chord, but subsequent duplicates are misplaced halfway down the truss height. It appears that they snap to the Braceworks snap line while maintaining their alignment.<br/>
<br/>
When duplicating a speaker, vertical and horizontal alignment should be maintained. Holding the Shift key while moving the duplicate should also preserve this alignment. However, the duplicates are not being positioned correctly.<br/>
<br/>
To verify this issue, follow these testing steps:<br/>
 # Open a new file and insert a truss line.<br/>
2. Add a speaker to the truss and align it with the truss chord.<br/>
3. Create a duplicate of the speaker and drag it along the truss chord, observing the results.<br/>
4. Repeat this process using the Move by Points tool set for placing duplicates.<br/>
<br/>
Note, my VW preferences have Offset Duplicates turned off.<br/>
<br/>
This problem persists with both our speaker tool and Andy Dunning&#39;s new one, as demonstrated in an attached videos.

This disrupts the workflow of the user and is therefore of high priority to us.

Go to attributes palette and select image as fill style, then in 3D the component with that material gets invisible.<br/>
See video and testfile.<br/>
I would expect wall and hardscape to have the same behavior.<br/>
I would expect hardscape that the image is seem in 2D too, when material has fill style image.

                A strange case with a viewport&#39;s render modes

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Please see attached video. Using the VW29.0.2d(715940)_64 autobuild, I randomly encounter a crash while changing the render modes of a viewport. I can&#39;t consistently reproduce the crash with a certain set of steps though. One thing that I notice is the crash usually happens when I accidentally double click on the &quot;Update&quot; button on the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
So I sync 29.0.x to the same build number (715940) and run a Debug build to try to get a call stack for it. I change the render modes, click &quot;Update&quot; on the OIP, then wait until the &quot;Cancel Update&quot; button appears, I click it, let it run for about an hour, and it finally crashes. Please see attached images for call stacks and variables&#39; values. It looks like there&#39;s one render job (fRunningJobs size = 1) that never gets removed because fStatus has a weird value (885211360).<br/>
<br/>
I try my best to explain it, but I don&#39;t think I completely understand what&#39;s going on, so I&#39;m sorry in advance if anything I describe doesn&#39;t make any sense at all.

Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Open the sample file [^13282.vwx].<br/>
2) There are two viewports arranged one above the other on the sheet layer, the upper viewport is set to the Renderworks style &quot;Redshift Exterior Fast_Sunset&quot;, and the lower viewport is set to the Renderworks style &quot;Realistic Exterior Fast_Sunset&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Also, this Bug is seem to be related to VB-197165.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce<br/>
For &quot;Export PDF&quot;<br/>
1) Open an attached file.(Sample.vwx)<br/>
2) Click the &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Export&quot; command &gt; &quot;Export PDF&quot; submenu command.<br/>
3) Click &quot;OK&quot; in the dialog and save it in any location.<br/>
4) Comparing the bold characters in the exported PDF &quot;MS Mincho&quot; and &quot;MS P Mincho&quot; with the characters on VW, they look different.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached files.(Sample.vwx Sample2.vwx and 13241.mp4)<br/>
<br/>
For &quot;Print&quot;<br/>
1) Open an attached file.(Sample.vwx)<br/>
2) Click the &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Print&quot; command.<br/>
3) Click &quot;OK&quot; and compare the printed result with the text on the VW and it looks different.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Workaround&quot;<br/>
For &quot;Export PDF&quot;<br/>
・Turn on [Rasterize text] in the &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Export&quot; command &gt; &quot;Export PDF&quot; submenu command &gt; &quot;Export PDF dialog&quot;.<br/>
・Turn on [Rasterize text] in the &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Publish&quot; command &gt; &quot;Publish&quot; dialog options &gt; &quot;Export PDF Settings&quot; dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached files.(Sample test1 Raster OFF.pdf Sample test2 Raster ON.pdf 13241 Workaround PDF.mp4)<br/>
<br/>
For &quot;Print&quot;<br/>
・Turn on [Rasterize Print OutPut] in the &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Print&quot; &gt; &quot;Print&quot; dialog.<br/>
・Disable [Use GDI+ Imaging] in &quot;Tools&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Options&quot; &gt; &quot;Vectorworks Preferences&quot; &gt;&quot;Display&quot; tab.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to avoid rasterization of text or want to operate with Use GDI+ Imaging enabled, the above workaround cannot be used.<br/>
Please let me know if there is a workaround by switching options.<br/>

But as you can see in the attached file and video, it is the &quot;roof textures&quot; of this class which determine the attributes of the roof component. Only when there are no &quot;roof textures&quot; set in the class, the component texture will be used.

2 Switch to any visible layer in the design layer<br/>
3 change the renderer to shaded and navigate around<br/>

If you start to duplicate the speaker objects, the counts change and still do not add up properly, until you get to the 20 I show in the second file.<br/>
<br/>
In the file with the filename ending in &quot;correct,&quot; the key shows 12 symbols and eight PIO versions of the speaker.<br/>
The drawing has 20 instances of speakers with various hanging methods assigned. <br/>
The Key should show a count of 20 total of each, in theory.<br/>
<br/>
We want 20 total Adamson Point 12 speakers to be shown.<br/>
<br/>
If we have to treat speakers solely as plug-in objects, we should not show any speaker symbols alone and only show all as PIOs.<br/>
<br/>
The main difference between the two sets of speakers (symbols vs. PIO) is the tilt angle.<br/>

Without automated depth cueing, users must resort to manually drawing them in Section and Interior Elevation Viewports. This tedious process is rendered a bit more efficient  with the Outer and Inner Boundary Modes of the 2D Polygon tool. Unfortunately, these appear to be broken in 2024 (seemingly a regression of VB-163815). Please see attached video and sample file.

<br/>
It contains a site model and two site modifiers which share a single vertex.<br/>
<br/>
Because the modifiers share a single vertex, this breaks the TIN and when contours reach the shared vertex they begin cycling inside the modifiers&#39; polygons until maximum iterations are reached.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same issue as the one described in VB-191744.

<br/>
when you draw a Strutural Element like a beam, a slope is automatically created, so you need to go to the PIO to load it later.<br/>
<br/>
It cannot be changed when the element is drawn.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it is 0° when 2 poles are connected.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023, the basic slope was 0.<br/>

This can be remedied by selecting the other function (a: forward / backward; b: up/down) under zoom direction in the 3dc driver.<br/>
<br/>
Desired zoom direction would be up and down (a) but the desired behaviour is sometimes under a, sometimes under b, depending on the switching error.<br/>
<br/>
Is this known? Can someone please test this and let us know if it can be solved or whats the diagnosis? Thank you in advance.

In the 2023 screenshot we can see that the objects and light definition is inferior to 2022, not so well defined. As example, the benches are not as visible and well defined with 2023 as they are with 2022. Other example is the light on the Truss objects, which is clearly better with 2022. One last example is the floor, that is displayed much cleanly with 2022 than 2023.<br/>

The moment I set layer height to 0, everything is fine.<br/>

<br/>
it is about worksheet functions.<br/>
We do have that new parser file 1914 WS Function Options.vwstrings.<br/>
This parser file makes the options of worksheet functions german.<br/>
For example Anzahl(Angle) becomes Anzahl(Winkel).<br/>
When this function get inserted, the command line shows correctly the german expression. But when edited, then the popups are blank.<br/>
See video.<br/>
<br/>
This report is related to VB-193855 - KLS: WSFunction options not German when browsing.<br/>

Even number like 2 leads to a false result in worksheet formula while 2,0 (which by the fact is the very same) leads to a correct result.<br/>
This should not be.<br/>

From user: The view jumps around and may even rotate upside down. Or it may not even respond to the mouse movement. The mouse pointer disappears sometimes. And I have even noticed that the mouse pointer might be &quot;teleported&quot; back to the other screen (the screen that is not not showing the Vectorworks window) and when I move the pointer back to Vectorworks, as soon as the pointer touches the 3D view area, the mouse pointer is teleported back to the other screen.

<br/>
In the attached Vectorworks Document is a Stair CW with a Bauweise: Gestemmte Treppe. In the Attributes the 2D Austritt is missing, which makes not possible for the Customer to define a filling colour to this. The workaround was to switch from Gestemmte Treppe to Massivtreppe, then give the wished color and then switch back to Gestemmte Treppe.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this and see if its possible to have 2D Austritt available in the Attribute Settings. Thank you in advance.

I had two Vectorworks drawings open at the same time and they were tabbed in the drawing window. I was clicking each tab to go back and forth to check the settings of one file&#39;s viewport settings and adjusting the other. Often, and repeatedly, for no apparent reason one of the documents became untabbed and filled the entire window as if having been pulled out. <br/>
This kept happening so I recorded the screen and you can see from the very short movie how it happens. I click on the tab, move my mouse away and then the document becomes untabbed and fills the window.<br/>

<br/>
Since it produce a dump file, I symbolized and attached in case there is something useful in there.<br/>
<br/>
Steps taken prior to crash:<br/>
 # Open attached file (just 3 different Lighting Devices &amp; Label Legend)<br/>
 # Select all the Lighting Devices<br/>
 # Go to Spotlight&gt;Spotlight Numbering<br/>
 # Set Spotlight Number with fields and values, just be sure to select an option for Accessory Numbering (ex. Next Number)<br/>
 # Set Primary Direction to anything other than Manual<br/>
 # Click OK to run<br/>
 # Double click on the selected Lighting Devices to open Edit window.<br/>
 # As seen in the video, I had All Lighting Devices selected and assigned the Label Legend to the Lighting Accessory.  When clicking through the Lighting Devices to show the Accessory patch info, Vectorworks froze up when clicking on the last Lighting Device and soon after crashed.

In the enclosed file and movie you can see that when I try and update the schematic views they do not update. The only way to get the instruments to show is to rebuild from scratch.<br/>

Note the file has two saved views so you can easily navigate between the two worlds. The file has been converted from 2022 which had the same issue. I note the file originated from 2016.<br/>

This is a minor issue and could be unlinked from UI review if we choose, but I&#39;m putting it there for now.<br/>

See the attached file. The lights in front schematic view do not show the nested symbol. The symbol alone, in a rendered front view, DOES show the nested component. (Though the stacking order is not correct, which is another issue).<br/>

 <br/>
・VW2022 or lower version<br/>
  The light source is angled according to the Tilt value.<br/>
 <br/>
・VW2023<br/>
 The light source is not angled according to the Tilt value.<br/>
 Also, setting the Focus Point does not change the angle.<br/>
 <br/>
■ Reproduction procedure<br/>
1) Create any symbol.<br/>
2) Concatenate the &quot;Light Info Record&quot; records in the resource manager.<br/>
3) Double-click the symbol and place it on the drawing as a Lighting Device.<br/>
4) Do Shaded rendering.<br/>
*At this time, turn off the &quot;Shadows&quot; option in Shaded Options.<br/>
5) Check the angle of light by setting the angle to &quot;Tilt&quot; of OIP.<br/>
 <br/>
■ Remarks<br/>
・Even in v2023, like the standard resource Lighting Device, if the object in the symbol is connected to the &quot;Parts&quot; record format, and the &quot;Body&quot; is set, the light source will rotate together with the Body.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, click and drag the blue handles for the Directional, Spot, or Custom Lights, then cancel the operation by pressing the Esc key. Although the light object is reset and its original direction drawn, the direction of the light at the time the operation was cancelled is also still drawn.<br/>
<br/>
This bug was originally found as part of the investigation into VB-198512 and was also found in VW23. At that time, some attempts were made to resolve this using CTS but nothing was found that didn&#39;t require major changes to how CTS works. The main issue come from the fact that the actual light object is changed as the light is rotated. This causes CTS to track changes without having a way to remove them in the case where the resize is cancelled, since there is no CTS event currently running.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that all other IResizer instances make changes to a temporary object for the drawing as the user moves the mouse. TLightResizer should be refactored to do that as well. This would prevent CTS from tracking any changes until the user completes the resize.

From DMX readings it was all ok. While pixel 1 started to do what is supposed to do (starting adding white colour), on top of that pixel 2 started to emiting with red color. In this example Vision is overlaying the channels 53 (Pixel 1 white) and the next channel 54 (Pixel 2 Red). Long story short while you changing value of the white channel on any pixel the next pixel starts emiting red.<br/>
<br/>
For further undertanding I took a TetraX GDTF library and deleted all RGB modes which gave me library with only one DMX break and when I used this library in Vision, then it starting to do what it should.

Fairly obscure this one, but I&#39;ve been using the Window&gt;Palettes&gt;Auto Hide Docked palettes a lot for video presentations and general work.<br/>
If you create a worksheet and have it opened on the screen (not placed on the page yet) if you close it, then all the docked palettes come back onto the screen.<br/>
If you go to the command it shows that it is still ticked. So you have to uncheck and re tick to carry on. This can be seen in a blank file, movie enclosed.<br/>

<br/>
Note that the Site Model has a series of small gaps in-between the Hardscapes, where it fails to get cut (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen when the shared edge of the Hardscapes is curved. <br/>
<br/>
All of the Hardscapes have their Simplification Tolerance set to 0&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The same problem technically happened in previous versions with Landscape Areas, but it isn&#39;t very common to have two adjacent Landscape Areas so it wasn&#39;t much of an issue. With Hardscapes, having adjacent objects seems to be pretty common.

I would like to know about the following two points.<br/>
1) Is it possible to install Vectorworks 2023?<br/>
2) If Vectorworks 2023 can be installed, will Vectorworks 2023 work properly? (Are there any restrictions on the operation of Vectorworks 2023?)<br/>
<br/>
*From a dealer, there was a user who wanted to purchase Sueface Pro 9 (SQ® 3/5G), and asked if Vectorworks would work.<br/>
(As for AutoCAD, it seems that the manufacturer responded that it does not work.)<br/>
<br/>
*Microsoft states in the Tech specs on the following page, &quot;[15] Surface Pro 9 (SQ® 3/5G) comes with Windows 11 Home on ARM. At this time, Surface Pro 9 (SQ® 3/5G) with Windows 11 Home on ARM will not install some games and CAD software, and some third-party drivers or anti-virus software.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It seems to work when using an entirely blank document or when using entirely new unstyled windows and walls in this file.  So the user at least has a workaround!<br/>
<br/>
I think there could be some setting I&#39;m overlooking but I can&#39;t for the life of me determine if this is just user error or a potential bug with their styled walls in this file.  Any help is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and have a great day!  :)

In the attached file the left wall recess, shows the texture from the insulation. This is wrong because the recess has a left side wrap. The recess on the right side is correct. The difference is the offset from wall top.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like what it looks like if all the components are off; the wall will just display as a solid rectangle.  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if this is intentional or if it could be a bug with using walls inside symbols.  Thank you for your time and have a great evening!  :)

I see the same behavior in VW2022 SP5, so this doesn&#39;t appear to be a regression.

<br/>
Attached is a screen video [^screen-vid.mp4] showing the ways I tried to achieve this.<br/>
<br/>
1) I use the &#39;Point on Arc&#39; mode of the Polyline tool:<br/>
Initially an open circle-shaped polyline is created.<br/>
Using the Reshape tool, I tried adding a new arc segment at the end while keeping the circle-shape so that the start and end points of the polyline match (without marking the polyline Closed!). This doesn&#39;t work, it always leaves an open segment at the end.<br/>
<br/>
2) Using the Polyline tool I created a circle-shaped polyline as a sequence of corner and arc vertices (as shown in the video).<br/>
Initially a closed circle-shaped polyline is created.<br/>
I made it Open (removed the Closed tag) which removes the last segment.<br/>
Again using the Reshape tool I tried to add a new arc segment at the end so that the start and end points of the circle-shaped polyline match, but again without success.<br/>
<br/>
(I need this to be able to create a Pathway Hardscape that models a circular pathway with touching endings, (i.e. which mimics a torus-shape).<br/>
note that the Pathway Hardscape&#39;s object path must always be an open poly, i.e. its center-line must always have a clearly defined starting and ending vertices.)

We received a file where using the polygon inner boundary mode takes long time to fill a simple rectangular area. At the moment user is using other tools to avoid using inner boundary mode but it would be good to see if it&#39;s possible to improve it. <br/>
<br/>
User have used it on areas intersecting with objects that have plant line applied which created some complicated polygons but i don&#39;t think that should freeze Vectorworks like that. <br/>

Though the ceiling classes are turned off, the 2D polygon tool still will fill the currently invisible ceiling parts,  such as the soffit, ceiling tiles, clouds etc as if they were visible,   Rather than only filling using only the currently visible portions of the symbol from the walls to the airwall lines.<br/>

<br/>
_&quot;I just ran into an issue. A closed polygon with a record format attached._<br/>
_Do an offset line._ _Record format disappears from the data tab.&quot;_<br/>
 <br/>
I confirmed. I know this technically creates a new object which is probably why the newly created object does not have the record attached but it would be expected an offset would maintain the original record.<br/>
 <br/>
I shared a workaround with using Data Manager to automatically assign records to specific classes but again, this does not follow our mission of being a software that is intuitive. Thank you.

<br/>
Note that the checkout dialog asks you to checkout a Roof and several Polylines. As far as I can tell, the Roof has no connection to the 3D Symbol.<br/>
<br/>
If I choose &quot;No&quot; in the checkout dialog and then try again, the checkout dialog won&#39;t appear immediately but will appear as soon as I zoom inside the edit mode. If I choose &quot;No&quot; again, I can then edit the Symbol without having to check anything out.

space objects on one specific design layer do not update when clipping the boundary.<br/>
Customer need to perform edit space boundary or moving the space object once or twice before the clipping is shown.<br/>
If you copy such a space object to a new empty document this weird behavior is still there.<br/>
If you draw a new space on that layer, then the space object is drawn displaced. Maybe this is a hint.<br/>
See video.<br/>

In both cases the architectural column subpart only shows outlines, but no surface and thus no material.

simple example, a door in a wall. Click Reverse Sides of wall in OIP. The direction of the wall gets changed and nothing more.<br/>
Add a wall end cap. Again click Reverse Sides. This time on first clock the wall direction get changed (as expected) and on second click the insertion point of the door goes to the other end of the wall.<br/>
See video.<br/>
Is this intended? Or is it a bug?<br/>
Please tell me.<br/>
If it&#39;S a bug, please fix it.<br/>

1) Open an attached file. (13235.vwx)<br/>

2) Change the current view to &quot;Front&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
*For objects that are not groups, it works correctly.<br/>
 Also, in the case of &quot;horizontal flip&quot;, it works correctly even with group object.<br/>
<br/>
4) Change the current view to &quot;Right&quot;.<br/>

5) Select the group object and execute &quot;Flip Horizontal&quot; to move the group shape to the right.<br/>

This is not my preferred way of working with polylines, I assume it is the same for many of our users, it a polyline is drawn using Radius vertex controls, it should remain radius vertexes if it is offset or clipped if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
The shape shown, the inside line was constructed using circles and fillets, then offset, the vertexes are a mix of radius and arc vertexes. I&#39;ve seen it in other situations, as well.<br/>

wall clipping of 2 walls to a roof face fails. One walls is fine. The moment the second wall gets connected to the roof face the clipping fails.<br/>

This is different from the OIP, where units are shown properly as soon as you enter the value. This does not affect the functionality of the tool, it just shows an inconsistency. This is in v29, but goes back to at least 2022.

<br/>
When using the Connect/Combine Tool on two Roof Face Objects, a gap between those objects and the wall remains and it shouldn&#39;t. If we switch the top Roof Face object angle from 0,00 to 0,001 the tool will now connect both Roof Face Objects correctly without the aforementioned gap.

To reproduce:<br/>
 * Go to the &quot;Building Shell&quot; layer<br/>

 * Now right-click on &quot;Symbol-5&quot; in the Resource Manager and choose &quot;Make Active&quot;<br/>

Note that the checkout dialog appears asking you to check out a Roof and some Polylines.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose &quot;No&quot; and then try again, it won&#39;t ask for the checkout on the second try.<br/>
<br/>
This might be related to VB-198369, where zooming with a Wall selected asks you to check out the same objects.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Activate the Polyline tool in &quot;Tangent Arc Mode&quot;<br/>
- Draw an object using the snap points on the left as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that the shape of the resulting Polyline is correct.<br/>
<br/>
- Now delete the poly<br/>
- Draw another poly using the same snap points, but this time place the last point in the wrong location (as if you accidentally mis-clicked)<br/>
- Press the Delete key to undo that last click<br/>
<br/>
Note that the click doesn&#39;t get undone on the first Delete, and even if you press Delete a few more times and then try to complete the object you can&#39;t get it back to a state where it&#39;ll draw the correct shape.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the same thing with the Polyline tool&#39;s &quot;Point on Arc Mode&quot;, using the snap points on the right. Note that the final shape doesn&#39;t get closed, as if the tool is ignoring the final click.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to at least VW 2020 so this might be a known issue, but I couldn&#39;t find any other reports in JIRA.

We would expect that &quot;/Vectorworks 2023 Viewer&quot; would remain in the path. Meaning, when we click on the &quot;Applications&quot; folder then we expect the folder &quot;Vectorworks 2023 Viewer&quot; to be installed in there and not loose files inside of &quot;Applications&quot;.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Splitting a shape assigned a line type of [a complex line type] may result in an incorrect shape.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Open the sample file (Sample230904_1_v2023.vwx).<br/>
<br/>
2) Split the polygon on the left side of the sample file using the [Line Split Mode] of the Split tool.<br/>
<br/>
3) There is no problem with the bottom polyline.<br/>
<br/>
However, polygons assigned a line type of [a complex line type] containing the letters top and middle are displayed with an incorrect shape.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* This problem also occurs in [Point Split Mode] and [Line Trim mode] of the Split Tool.<br/>
<br/>
* In the sample file, after splitting, the shape converted to polyline can be displayed in its original shape by converting it to polygon.<br/>
<br/>
* We have confirmed that the shape is also incorrect when a line type of [a complex line type] containing text is assigned to [Polyline], [Circle], or [Oval].<br/>
<br/>
* We have not been able to confirm this problem with general Dashed and complex line types that do not include Text.<br/>
<br/>
* The longer the straight line part of a complex line type that includes Text, the more likely it is to reproduce the problem.<br/>
<br/>
*Findings*<br/>
It is possible to display the image in its original shape by converting it to polygon after splitting, but we think it needs to be modified.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I assume that VW goes for the insertion point or assumed center of the PIO instead of the actual location of the cursor (actually, the insertion point of this PIO is NOT at its center).<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, just copy attached plug-in into your plug-ins folder and use attached testfile.<br/>

The compiler generates the error: &quot;Identifier not declared&quot; on Line 70, containing this command.<br/>

However, it does compile in VW 2023 SP0 (668937). I did not check the middle versions of VW 2023 to determine when it stopped working. <br/>
<br/>
See attached file. It is saved in VW 2023 format for your convenience, and contains a script with all of the functions released in VW 2023. It is meant to be compiled only. It does not run (nicely). Remove Line 70 and the rest of the functions compile.

                Edit Wall Tool Highlights Curtain Wall Frames/Panels Incorrectly in 2023
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Curtain Wall.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Activate the Edit Wall tool in Edit frames and Panels Mode<br/>
- Click-select a frame or panel<br/>
<br/>
Note that it works fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
- Now click in empty space<br/>
- Try to click-select a frame/panel again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it gets treated kind of like a marquee selection, and the wrong frames/panels get selected. This happens even if you deactivate and reactivate the tool, but it goes away once any frame/panel is selected.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, before the new Edit Wall tool was added, clicking in empty space with the Edit Curtain Wall tool did not cause the Wall to get de-selected, so this problem didn&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2023 SP0.

They submitted a second file of the resulting design layer import.  I got the the same results when did a design layer import of Phoenix into a new blank file.<br/>

After the design layer import the doors that do stay in their original location have been converted to groups and no longer doors in wall.<br/>

                Door Jamb/Wall opening line weight not shown, notch in wall when jamb is zero depth/width
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I was speaking to a customer and they were curious about showing a door within a wall with jamb settings set to zero. They set the jamb to depth &amp; width to zero and the line weight around the wall stopped where the jamb was supposed to be, so it looked like there was no line in the wall opening where the door is inserted. I haven&#39;t seen this issue in previous versions, and when I tried to replicate the issue I noticed that there is a certain order of steps to receive that result. When doing different orders of operations when changing the settings of the door jamb depth and width, I have noticed a very small notch in the wall where the jamb was and the wall line is broken there as well. <br/>
<br/>
So there are two issues: the wall opening lines that do not show, and the small notch. Both occur when editing the door jamb width and depth settings a certain way. <br/>
<br/>
I have replicated this in their file and in a blank file, and those files are attached and a video of me explaining the process is attached. Also I was speaking to Neil Barman about this and he was able to replicate as well. Please reach out if there are questions.

The door also has a jamb and head overlap defined as 2&quot;. As you  can see, this makes the leaf actually 3&#39;-4&quot; wide and 8&#39;-2&quot; tall. In order to be consistent, Barn Doors should default to &quot;by opening&quot;, or the leaf size as reported in the Object Info Palette should account for the overlap, since that overlap does in fact increase the leaf size. Otherwise, the size reported on the door schedule and the size dimensioned on the door legend will not be the same.

<br/>
This file seems to have a problem when replacing the user&#39;s custom window styles. I tried to Reset All Plugins but this did not help. <br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
 * Open the file<br/>
 * Select one of the Windows inserted into the wall<br/>
Replace their style with _DS_W&amp;D/WN: Type02_ style<br/>
 * The 3D representation of the window will be displayed with 3 columns instead of 2 like the style.<br/>
 * Replacing the _DS_W&amp;D/WN: Type02_ style with the _DS_W&amp;D/WN: Type05_ will result in the window being displayed in 3D with 1 column only instead of 2.<br/>
<br/>
I exported the file to v2022 and the problem is not happening in VW 2022.<br/>
<br/>
I attached a video showing the issue, the v2022 and the original 2023 file that the user provided.

<br/>
This happens if I update a window by &quot;replace style&quot; or &quot;editing plug-in style&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have to to manually replace each window in the building with the updated one from resource-pallet. Just to mark a window and use &quot;replace style&quot;, or editing plugin-style will not update all properties of the windows already in use in building.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in 2023 the &quot;custom configuration options&quot; is not grayed out in settings for a styled window even if &quot;custom configuration&quot; is marked &quot;by style&quot; As result there is no way to lock the custom configuration in a style.<br/>
<br/>
(In 2022, that works fine, &quot;custom sash&quot;  is grayed out if marked by style)<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When showing the &quot;operation direction&quot; of &quot;Sliding&quot; in the door tool, the display of &quot;operation direction&quot; may be incorrect depending on the settings.<br/>
<br/>
The Marker object of &quot;operation direction&quot; has difference with display shape both VW2022 and VW2023. <br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce on VW2023. <br/>
1) Open Vectorworks2023.<br/>
2) Select Door tool on tool palette.<br/>
Click  &#39;Door Preferences&#39; button on the mode bar &gt;&#39;Door Preferences&#39; dialog &gt;Select &#39;General&#39; Pane &gt; Configuration: Sliding<br/>
Operation: XX<br/>
3) Select &#39;2D Visualization&#39; pane &gt; check &quot;Show Openration direction&quot;.<br/>
4) Place the door on the work screen. Arrow markers also appear to overlap each other.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce with VW2022.<br/>
1) Open Vectorworks2022.<br/>
2) Select Door tool on tool palette.<br/>
Click  &#39;Door Preferences&#39; button on the mode bar &gt;&#39;Door Preferences&#39; dialog &gt;Select  &#39;2D Visualization&#39; pane &gt; check the box &quot;Show operation direction&quot;.<br/>
The arrow for the opening direction is displayed correctly for the sliding door.<br/>
Place the door on the work screen. <br/>
Arrow markers will appear correctly shape.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore,<br/>
3) Save the file. (Sample13127.vwx)<br/>
4) Open the file saved in 4) with Vectorworks2023.<br/>
<br/>
*The shape of arrow for the opening direction will be changing.<br/>
<br/>
Compare with Vectorworks2022 (v2022PDF.pdf).<br/>
Overall, the &quot;operation direction&quot; marker (straight line with marker) is short, depending on the width of the door, the markers on both ends will overlap each other.<br/>
—<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 * Even with the window tool, if I display &quot;operation direction&quot; with &quot;Sliding&quot;, it will be in the same state.<br/>
(There was no &quot;Show operation direction&quot; option in the window tools in v2022.)<br/>

<br/>
Note that the slope direction remains the same.<br/>
<br/>
I might be misunderstanding this, but since these options are defined by Left/Right and the object&#39;s overall left/right orientation is determined by the Interior Side (always looking inward from the exterior), it seems like changing the Interior Side should always change the visible direction of the slope.

This also happens with the Window Shim Gap toggles.<br/>

These toggles are failing completely on Win 10, even for single selections (will report separately).

                T02346 - Wall Closure Gaps Affect Doors/Windows Even When &quot;Use Wall Provided Gaps&quot; is Disabled
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * Select one of the Doors and enable the &quot;Use wall provided gaps&quot; option<br/>
 * Now open the Wall Closures dialog and apply gap values as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that the gaps are applied as expected.<br/>
 * Now select the other Door and, this time with the &quot;Use wall provided gaps&quot; option disabled, open the Wall Closures dialog<br/>
 * Again apply gap values<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Door is still affected by these changes, even though &quot;Use wall provided gaps&quot; is disabled. The gaps aren&#39;t getting created correctly (they cut inward toward the middle of the Door instead of outward toward the wall) but I don&#39;t think they should be showing at all in this case.

In VW 2024, note that the handles show on the interior face of the Wall.<br/>
<br/>
The T02348 task doc (F7) shows that we&#39;ve added plugin support to control the location of the handles along the width of the Wall, but it doesn&#39;t say that our Windows and Doors implemented it, and it indicates that it should also happen in 2D (it&#39;s currently only happening in 3D). The task doc (in R7) also states that the control points should be on the exterior face of the Wall, and they&#39;re currently on the interior face.

<br/>
{*}EDIT{*}: Looking at the 3D geometry of the window shows that the jamb and sash both have self-intersecting geometry.  These top shapes have always had issues but it looks the hidden line render is having more issues with them.  Since the core of the issue is bad geometry, I think we need to fix this by improving the geometry.<br/>
<br/>
[~jwarshaw]:  This really points to geometry issues with the following three Window Top Shapes:<br/>
 * Half Ellipse:  The top of the sash is incorrectly drawn to the top of the top jamb.<br/>
 * Half Gothic:  The top of the sash is incorrectly drawn to the top of the top jamb.<br/>
 * Gothic:  The sash does not follow the shape of the jamb<br/>

Mac/Win<br/>
v2023(Occurs from previous versions)<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Create a wall (example: Thickness 150)<br/>
2) Door Tool &gt; Door Tool Preferences &gt;<br/>
General pane &gt; Configuration: Pocket<br/>
Configuration: Pocket pane &gt; Check &quot;Use exposed pocket recess&quot;<br/>
3) Insert the door into the wall.<br/>
4) Object Info Palette &gt; Door In Wall &gt; Set the Jamb Depth value to 151.<br/>
   Unnecessary material is generated.<br/>
<br/>
Unnecessary material is generat when Jamb Depth is set to Wall&#39;s Thickness or more<br/>
Jamb Depth does not spawn below Wall&#39;s Thickness (Correct)<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;sample13071.vwx&quot;,&quot;sample13071.pdf&quot;,and &quot;sample13071_2.pdf&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
*Remarks<br/>
In Japan, this type of Pocket door is used frequently, so I guess that the &quot;Use exposed pocket recess&quot; function was adopted at the request of Japan, but at least in Japan, there is no such unnecessary material.<br/>
<br/>
(It seems to have occurred since the &quot;Use exposed pocket recess&quot; was added. 2021?)<br/>
<br/>
[Priority: Critical]<br/>
From support section - This bug significantly reduces the value of the entire standard door tool, so please fix it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
If this material in other countries, please hide it in settings or classes.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

For example, if the site model settings has minor contour intervals set to 1-foot, and the Open Edge modifier was set at an elevation of 5 feet, then the resulting contour should align exactly. If set to 5.5 feet, then it would interpolate. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem seems to occur more often on &quot;fills&quot; rather than &quot;cuts&quot;. In the attached example attached notice how the top contour drawn (Open Edge modifier) does not have the site models contour following it.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- In the Resource Manager, delete &quot;Line Type 1&quot;<br/>
- Choose to replace it with &quot;Line Type 2&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the SM initially shows the correct Line Type, but if you open the Settings dialog you&#39;ll see that it has &quot;None&quot; set as the Line Type. Once you close the Settings dialog, the lines on the SM will all change to solid.<br/>
<br/>
By comparison, Material/Texture/Class resources all seem to get replaced correctly on SMs.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2023.

This only seems to happen when the edit involves switching _to_ a Story level. If you go the opposite direction (it&#39;s currently using a Story level and you switch to &quot;Layer Elevation&quot;), it works fine.<br/>

If I am doing the process incorrectly, please let me know. I am simply trying to modify the beam using the same logic and techniques that I would modify a polyline.<br/>
<br/>
(I do see that the change vertex mode will work on a structural member initially drawn with Poly Insertion mode, but it is reasonable to expect that users may start with a straight member and then modify it using the provide reshape tools afterwards, especially since we are providing the modes to add, remove, and change a vertex.)

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
I could not move the &quot;Structure Member&quot; in Join state with the selection tool.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce_1<br/>
1) Open the sample file [Sample230303.vwx].<br/>
2)  Select both only one Structural Member and all the Structural Members arranged in a square shape (5 in total).<br/>
3) Move it to any place with the Selection Tool.<br/>
4) It does not move even if I try to move the combined structural members with the selection tool.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce_2<br/>
Please try this steps also.<br/>
1)Create new shee and et drawing scale to 1:50 on VW2023SP2.<br/>
2) Select &#39;structural member&#39; tool and confirm a mode  &#39;Linear Member Style&#39;,<br/>
   &#39;Auto Join Members Mode&#39;.<br/>
3) Draw structural member to T shape with join.<br/>
4) Select Selection tool and move T shape structural member object.<br/>
It does works fine.<br/>
5) Adding one structural member that does not join existiong T shape structure menbers.<br/>
6) Drag only independent one structures to move after select T shape and independent <br/>
   one structures.<br/>
   The dragging independent one structure will be moved however T shape structures does not.<br/>
7) After tring move operation, Two structure one and T shape, <br/>
   there relative position will be wrong after execute undo command many times.<br/>
*Please refer the [Sample 2.vwx] file.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
- This does not occur in older versions.<br/>
- It has been confirmed that it does not reappear when moving with only the connected Structural Members selected.<br/>
- We have confirmed that when this problem occurs, the same problem continues until Vectorworks is restarted or the connection of the structural material is released.<br/>

<br/>
1) Open the attached file.<br/>
There is a polygon. This is created from walls taken from a file that reproduces the problem.<br/>
2) Create walls along the polygon.<br/>
3) Go to AEC &gt; Framing and select &quot;Wall Framer&quot;. &quot;New Framing Model&quot; dialog box opens, enter any name and click &quot;Create&quot;.<br/>
4) &quot;Wall Framing&quot; dialog box opens. Click &quot;Options&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Wall Class&quot; dialog box opens and enable &quot;Double Bottom Plate&quot;.<br/>
5) Click OK and wall framing is created. There is a framework sticking out of the endpoint.<br/>
<br/>
*The wall (polygon) that reproduced the problem was not created with the intended procedure or numerical values, it was by chance.<br/>
Therefore, we can not to explain specific conditions and steps of the problem.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Right-click the small SM on the left and choose &quot;Create Similar Object&quot;<br/>
- Draw a few diagonal members that connect to the horizontal members as shown<br/>
- Now move the middle horizontal member up and then down <br/>
<br/>
Note that this causes the bottom diagonal member to go into an odd state, where it&#39;s still technically joined but shows its endpoints in the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2023.

This used to cause a crash, but after CL691999 it creates an SM with no 3D geometry.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where the values are valid and it should be possible to create a corresponding SM, we need to do so.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where it is impossible to generate a valid SM with the input values, we should have some code validating the inputs and prompt the user to correct them before we even close the dialog.

In Spotlight when I have lamps attached to a pipes ( that are connected to a truss), when I click on select system objects, in Object info, the Pipes do not highlight or show as part of the system, even though they are connected, and the lamps, which are attached to the pipes, are also not highlighted. So the problem is that on a larger system I cannot be sure that all lamps/ pipes are connected, which then affects my Braceworks calculation<br/>

This is purely a graphic regression but it&#39;s an important capability for some.<br/>
In previous versions if you place an instrument Summary (IS) on the page and have the Bounding Border Style set to Double, then if you change the colour fill only the border changes colour. This is the current functionality and is useful for those using the double border.<br/>
In v2024 if you try the same then the entire Instrument Summary&#39;s fill changes. This is not desired. Please see attached screenshots of the same IS in both v2023 and v2024.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When the color palette is opened in color grid view, the color grid may not be displayed.<br/>
When the mouse cursor is traced over an area where the color grid is not displayed, the color grid in the traced area becomes visible and can be selected.<br/>
Once the cursor is traced over an area, it will not disappear and the area will remain selectable.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* The problem occurs even after restarting Vectorworks.<br/>
* The problem does not occur in the color list display.<br/>
* We could not confirm the problem in our company environment.<br/>
* The problem occurs only on the customer&#39;s specific PC.<br/>
* We will attach a screenshot of the problem when they occur in the customer&#39;s environment.<br/>
* We believe it is a graphics problem and have asked the customer to update the graphics (NVIDIA RTX A2000 12GB) to the latest driver and check the settings, but the problems have not improved.<br/>
<br/>
*We have confirmed that the reproducibility is high when specific conditions are met.*<br/>
 <br/>
Conditions easy to reproduce:<br/>
* When the color palette is displayed and the scroll bar is visible<br/>
<br/>
* When the color palette is opened, depending on the blank area, the color palette expansion may be split between the top and the bottom. When this is just near the switching point.<br/>
<br/>
* As a finding, this seems to depend on the screen resolution.<br/>
We have confirmed that similar positions on machines with different resolutions are not reproducible.<br/>
This may be caused by the maximum range at which the color palette is expanded.<br/>

<br/>
In the attached Vectorworks file there are two Section Viewports, in this Section Viewports we can see a Symbol in Wall that is in one being only partially displayed an in the other totally invisble. When we edit the Section in Place and drag this Symbol in Wall a bit to the side (like its shown in the video) then the Symbols start being displayed.<br/>

<br/>
1. Data gets cleared when copying from one file into another.<br/>
F.e. an entry in the ID field<br/>
This is critical, because there are times when you have to copy from a backup or an old file. With instruments, trusses, pipes etc. this doesn’t happen<br/>
2. if &#39;Output&#39; is connected, the field in the drop-down is empty. Would be good to have the connected ID displayed. Otherwise you always have to click the drop-down and scroll.<br/>

<br/>
The following situation:<br/>
3 layers of PreRig stacked on top of each other - all connected with drops. I have to constantly adjust the height of the PreRigs, so I only move this in height. You could probably say now that my mistake is that I&#39;m not using &quot;adjust system trim height,&quot; but manually moving the trusses via the z-coordinate. Okay, but it&#39;s happened now. The heights are final now, and I want to adjust the drops without having to redo all of them, and I don&#39;t want them to align with the center of the truss but with the bottom/top edge.<br/>
Problem: There are now motors that have chains that are too long. They are no longer connected to the lower PreRig layer, but due to the position of the upper hook, they&#39;ve connected with the PreRig layer above. When I try to manually change this by adjusting the height of the upper hook, it doesn&#39;t shorten the chain (definitely a bug), but pulls the upper truss down as well. However, I don&#39;t want that (see video). Currently, I have to adjust the height of the upper hook twice in a row - then on the second attempt, it shortens the chain - and then adjust all trusses back to the correct height. This takes time, I&#39;m essentially doing everything twice, and I might forget one. Additionally, Vectorworks always wants to delete the motors/drops of the upper layer of trusses.<br/>
Desired outcome: When I manually change the data of a chain hoist/drop, the truss shouldn&#39;t automatically move along with it, or I should be able to disable that somewhere.

<br/>
I think I&#39;ve posted this bug before but I don&#39;t remember... In this example file I&#39;ve got trusses connected with hinge and 2,50° angle for the first one, and 2,98° for the second. When everything is correctly connected with correct hinge angle, Braceworks doesn&#39;t calculate and error is : 2 structural elements can&#39;t occupy the same space.<br/>
<br/>
I had to put 5° to hinge, without move the trusses, and then ther is no braceworks error. It looks like hinge have to be set at a minimum angle ?

the insertion tool ignores the high hook height set in the preferences and instead automatically extends the high hook of the hoist to its maximum length to reach the hanging point or before adding a deadhang bridle to extend to the hanging point. <br/>
<br/>
The issue is that riggers often recieve truss plots with trusses already placed and trimmed to the required height. This means that they need to make sure the hoist has enough chain to reach the ground or the system will not work. <br/>
So the desired workflow would be to set the highhook height in the hoist insertion tool preferences and then insert the hoist to ensure that there is enought chain and that any needed bridle material is correctly caluclated without needing to go back and edit the hoist and or deadhang bridle after insertion.

<br/>
In the attached clip, I copy two trusses lying below each other, including motors, and paste them in a new layer at the same position. Then I move them twice and the second time I get the query: &quot;Do you want to delete the chain hoists that were separated by the last action? Why does this query only appear now? I would understand it if it came with the first move, since the two outer points no longer go into the PreRigg. But what is much worse is that if I press OK now, it deletes one or perhaps even several points in the plan that have nothing at all to do with it. This must not happen under any circumstances. I had this happen several times in the file with the query and was surprised that points where I was 100% sure that I had drawn them were gone.<br/>
The colleague told me that his headlights had also been extinguished.<br/>

<br/>
Exporting (FIXTURES ONLY) form capture as a MVR file. Import MVR files back into capture everything is fine. How ever when import the MVR file into Vectorworks 2023 I experience the following. The fixtures that have different ROTATION info than what VWX understands ends up being located positionally at 0,0 on the MVR import. A fixture that has ROTATIONAL value of X -0.0º , Y -0.0º , X 0º imports into VWX perfectly. A fixture that has ROTATIONAL value of X 0.0º , Y -0.0º , X 0º imports into VWX wrong and is LOCATED at 0,0 in the drawing. This also happens with fixtures rotated at other degrees. I think it has to do with the Value combination.<br/>
<br/>
Steps: Happens every time I import a MVR file from capture that has values or a format that vectorworks doesn&#39;t recognize.

This was submitted by a user Charles Arrata (charles@projx.ca) and I&#39;ve done some testing with it here and would like to report it to see if this is working as designed or a potential bug in Braceworks.  <br/>
<br/>
If we use the Bridle tool using Bridle Parts and with House Rigging Points, everything adds up well.  (This is in the second option from the top in the attached image.)<br/>
<br/>
However, if we place in the Reversed Two Leg Bridle with the Build Down Leg using a Hoist (the top option in the image, or the third option with a House Rigging Point also present), neither the Hoist nor the House Rigging Point will calculate with the correct values.  You can also successfully place in the Bridle but then swap out the Down Leg of the Bridle with a Hoist, which then appears to not count the correct weights again.  <br/>
<br/>
Users can work around this by replacing the Down Leg with a Hoist (the fourth option in the image) but only referring to the initial weight on the House Rigging Point, but it&#39;d be great if it could calculate the weight on the motor and also update the House Rigging Point afterwards.  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if there&#39;s anything I can help out with and have a great day!  :)<br/>

<br/>
In the enclosed file created originally in v2022 but saved in v2023 contains a custom truss object and has a phantom cross above it. No matter what I do with the magnets - in the file I&#39;ve just deleted them, the 3D poly that makes the cross is still there. This is viewable in Hidden Line and when selected.<br/>
<br/>
I have deleted the magnets to no avail. BTW why does the truss still connect when using the Truss tool when it doesn&#39;t have any magnets?<br/>

                Cable tool snaps to wrong point in hoists
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Reported by Annelien:<br/>
<br/>
When cabling hoists, the cable tool snaps to the insertion point of the hoist. This works fine if the hoist is in the down position, but not for hoists in the up position.<br/>
<br/>
For hoists in the down position the insertionpoint matches up to the input for power etc. However, hoists in the up position have the hoist (with its input etc.) hanging at the top of the chain. This does not match up with the insertionpoint, and results in visual mistakes and cable-length mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
The drawn cable line always snaps to the bottom of the hoist object. Therefore it calculates the cable-length to the wrong point, resulting in extra length if the cable comes from a support truss (see picture). This also affects cables that connect two hoists, causing wrong visuals.<br/>
<br/>
Explanation picture: see attachment<br/>
<br/>
The client uses UP Hoists, so the cabling for these hoists can all be sorted out at the top &quot;support trusses&quot;. However when connecting these hoists with a distro: VW wants the cable to connect at the bottom of the hoist (as if it was a DOWN hoist).<br/>
RED CABLE: Distro-Hoist<br/>
CYAN CABLE: Hoist-Hoist<br/>
<br/>
I was in contact about this with Jesse Cogdell, he explained:<br/>
&quot;currently cables automatically snap to the insertion point of the object they are connecting with, which works fine for hoists in the normal down position but not for hoists in the up position. At the moment there isn&#39;t any easy solution for this, you can reshape the cable in a 3D view so that the length is accurate but this is fairly time consuming. On the plus side since the cable edit function is not really working yet the cable will retain the connection information. Can you put in a bug report about this? and add Scott Parker and myself as watchers?&quot;

                                            <td class="description">      It seems that if you execute the Set 3D View command, undo and redo it a couple time, and then repeat these steps, eventually the Set 3D View command will break the undo system. It does not seem to be tied to the type of projection you are using (ie; narrow, wide, normal, ortho, current). It seems quite odd to me how inconsistent it is; meaning I would expect it to happen every time not just the third time.<br/>
<br/>
For clarification purposes, when I say &quot;undo warnings&quot; what I mean is a DSTOP. I&#39;ve attached a screenshot of the DSTOP message.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to see how far back this issue goes as I&#39;m not sure how easily this can be tested with an autobuild since they do not show DSTOP messages.

<br/>
Revisiting this age old issue with a breakthrough of being able to replicate it. WINDOWS ONLY.<br/>
<br/>
The problem: A file freezes and at that point even if we make it the active file by clicking on the tab of it, Vectorworks still thinks that the other open file is the active file. Anything we will do on the master file that is frozen will happen on the other file tab. Even when we have the master file active if we will check the resource manager it shows that the file which is not active is considered as the active file.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to find a way to recreate this issue in a very specific setup and using a user folder copied from one of our client machines. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please replace your user folder with the provided one.<br/>
Open the file MS layout 3_1678723675.897978 and update all of the references. <br/>
Save the file and close Vectorworks.<br/>
Open the file again. <br/>
<br/>
What happens is that an additional Untitled file opens up and stays instead of being closed automatically, which Vectorworks thinks is the active file even tho we have the Master file opened. <br/>
<br/>
This isolated example only shows us this problem temporarily as if we switch the tab to untitled file and switch back to MS layout it gets unstuck. But this is a perfect example of the file freezing. We were able to replicate it on our side and i will attach a video later on. <br/>
<br/>
This is a problem that i was finding on windows user machines since 2016 version of Vectorworks. We had multiple companies and a lot of users running into this problem now and then. There are multiple jira&#39;s created for this issue and i think this is the first time i have seen this issue happening 100% of time.

- now select another menu at the bottom of the list with ctrl + click.  This will add another menu to the selection but not deselect the big block at the top.<br/>
- Now drag and drop that selection over to the right, you&#39;ll notice that only the visible menu items were moved over.  <br/>

I think the control is ignoring any selected items that aren&#39;t visible.<br/>

                Aligned Hardscapes/Site Modifiers Ignore Layer Restrictions When First Created
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Site Model and two Site Modifiers that are placed on different layers.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Activate the Site Modifier or Hardscape tools in Aligned Mode<br/>
- Draw an object as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that the object initially aligns with both modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
- Now click the &quot;Realign&quot; button in the OIP<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the object loses its alignment with the modifier on Design Layer-2.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this is happening because the Site Modifier/Hardscape defaults to &quot;Same Layer as Modifier&quot; for its &quot;Align with Objects On:&quot; option, and that option is only taking effect once the object is reset.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like these layer restrictions should take effect as soon as the object is drawn, rather than on the next reset. The current behavior gives the impression that the object is losing a valid alignment which isn&#39;t actually the case.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022 with Aligned Hardscapes.

When executing (starting) a shortcut key that does not use the Alt key or does not immediately display a dialog box, the screen scrolls by itself when the mouse cursor is moved to the screen scrolling area.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1)Execute (start) the Selection Tool tool with the shortcut X key.<br/>
2)Move the mouse cursor to the screen scrolling area on the top, bottom, left and right of the screen.<br/>
Then the screen scrolls.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*We confirmed that this problem is not reproduced in Vectorworks 2022 or lower.<br/>
<br/>
*We confirmed that the problem is not reproduced in the MacOS environment, including older versions.<br/>
<br/>
*We confirmed that the trigger of the phenomenon in question was released when the screen was moved with the mouse wheel clicked (the problem is not reproduced).<br/>
<br/>
*In addition, we confirmed that the phenomenon is not canceled in boomerang mode with the space tool, and that the trigger is met, so the problem occurs.<br/>
<br/>
*Vectoroworks2024 (709930) confirmed that this does not occur.<br/>
<br/>
*Findings*<br/>
Some users execute commands directly without using shortcut keys. However, this problem seems to occur frequently for those who use shortcut keys frequently, because they can easily reproduce the same procedure.<br/>

<br/>
For what it is worth, Windows was set to Dark Mode. The Open dialog displays in dark while the rest of the app, including Home Screen, has a light theme. It was very noticeable during the crash when the Open dialog began to paint with a dark frame prior to the crash. The issue does not, however, appear to be related to dark mode because subsequent tests were successful.<br/>

<br/>
The enclosed file has a rectangle with an image fill. The image fill if extracted is a black and white PNG. However Image Effects have been added and the change in colour has been achieved by having the saturation at 100%,<br/>
<br/>
When in a viewport on a sheet layer, note that it mostly exports as coloured but when it gets to a certain scale it exports as black and white. In my case at 1:50 but in the user&#39;s case 1:200.<br/>
<br/>
I include a small test file and PDF export. Somewhat obscure!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;If you enter a character in the record field of the record format&quot;<br/>
1) Create a record format.<br/>
2) Enter &quot;あいうえお&quot; in the OIP record field.<br/>
3) When you press the F10 key, the entered characters disappear. Then the File menu becomes active.<br/>
*Until Vectorworks2019, characters could be converted when F10 was pressed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you enter a character in the OIP name&quot;<br/>
1) Enter &quot;あいうえお&quot; for the OIP name.<br/>
2) When you press F10, the characters are converted. (File menu is not actived.)<br/>

<br/>
See attached screenshots.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows, the Line Type column of the Structural Member Properties dialog and the Line Column of the Org Dialog show only the image, no text.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac, these dialog controls show the image and text.<br/>
<br/>
I believe as with the other control types, we should be able to use kListBrowserDisplayImageAndText for this column. Using this does resolve the issue on Windows, but then the Mac control only shows text and no image, so this is not a suitable fix right now. <br/>
<br/>
I think the best fix for this would be to make the line style control work on Mac and Windows for kListBrowserDisplayImageAndText.

                List Browser does not display text with image for Hatch/Tile/Gradient as expected

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This issue appears to have started with CL 705994. <br/>
<br/>
The Structural Member Dialog (Attributes Pane, Fill Column) and Org Dialog (Classes Pane, Fill Column) do not display the image and text as expected for Hatch, Tile, and Gradient fills.<br/>
<br/>
For some background:<br/>
<br/>
The list browsers in the Structural Member Dialog (Attributes Pane, Fill Column) and Org Dialog (Classes Pane, Fill Column) have individual rows that show different controls depending on what the Fill type is. <br/>
<br/>
For a solid fill, we just show Image Only, no text. For hatch/tile/gradient, we show Image and text.<br/>
<br/>
To accomplish this, we use EListBrowserDisplayType::kListBrowserDisplayImageOnly for that column, and set the appropriate EListBrowserItemInteractionType and EListBrowserOwnerDrawnType for each individual cell depending on the Fill type. <br/>
<br/>
Because EListBrowserDisplayType can (currently) only be set for the whole column, we cannot just change that to kListBrowserDisplayImageAndText for these rows.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Dialog.X and LayoutSDK.X have a version of SetListBrowserEditDisplayType that takes a rowindex as well, but this not appear to be available in VWListBrowserItem or the SDK. So we cannot change the display type for the specific row and column.

                Spotlight - Lighting Devices Do Not Insert Properly When Truss Elevation is Changed
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Video attached for clarity and step to reproduce are below.<br/>
<br/>
-Insert multiple pieces of truss into a system. Convert that to a Hanging Position.<br/>
<br/>
-Insert a Lighting Device onto one of the truss members/hanging position<br/>
<br/>
-Adjust the &quot;Z&quot; value of that truss.<br/>
<br/>
-In an isometric view, notice that the Lighting Device is still connected to the truss.<br/>
<br/>
-In that isometric view, attempt to insert a Lighting Device.<br/>
<br/>
-Notice that the Lighting device inserts at the same &quot;Z&quot; value in which the truss was inserted (0&#39;0&quot;) and not at the new &quot;Z&quot; value of the truss.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the Lighting Device is inserting to the truss. As the truss&#39; &quot;Z&quot; value is changed, the added Lighting Device also changes. Inserting a Lighting Device in an iso view always yields this result. Inserting a Lighting Device in Top/Plan occasionally inserts correctly, but majority of the time not.

Close the box.<br/>
open the dialog again. This time, the window will show what was seen last time, but without any inventories highlighted.<br/>

Either, we need to offer a blank window. Or, we need to retain the highlights on the inventories from the last use.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
The &quot;BIMobject&quot; tool in the Furn/Fixtures section of the Toolset palette does not allow users to log in with a Google account.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Click on Furn/Fixtures Tools Set &gt; BIMobject Tools &gt; Browse/Download<br/>
2) The Web Browser screen opens.<br/>
3) Click on the &quot;Google&quot; button.<br/>
4) The login screen will appear. Click the &quot;Next&quot; button.<br/>
5) The following message will appear.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
 * We confirmed that the same phenomenon occurs up to v2021.<br/>
 * In v2020, we confirmed that the Google/Autodesk/Linkedin buttons do not respond in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
*Questions*<br/>
We would like to know if there is any information on whether or not we can no longer log in with my Google account, etc.<br/>
<br/>
*Findings*<br/>
This is the same in the previous version, but in light of the fact that we have not received any inquiries about similar cases, we expect that there has been some specification change (e.g., security specification change) in the Google account login, and as a result, Vectorworks has been unable to log in to the site.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
One of our users is having a problem when using the PlantPARTNER in Vectorworks and trying to generate a report using the PlantPARTNER record as criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, they see the plant with the PlantPARTNER record in the Resource Manager with all the information, but when placing the plant on the drawing, the record goes missing.<br/>
<br/>
I am attaching a test file and also a video showing the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help.

It contains a hardscape on a layer with elevation 2000.<br/>
<br/>
*Edit Surface Modifiers* through right click.<br/>
<br/>
Add a stake somewhere on the hardscape and notice that it gets created with label == 2000 and z == 0.<br/>
<br/>
Increasing the z to 2000 increases the label to 4000.<br/>
<br/>
After exiting the Surface Modifiers edit mode the stake uses the elevation from the label and thus if the label shows 4000, then those are layer coordinates and the stake will have 6000 as global coordinates (ground plane coordinates).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the stake should always be created with label == 0 initially, independently of the layer elevation as the stakes show layer coordinates, not ground plane coordinates.

The option stays ticked, the 2D geometry gets modified correctly, the 3D geometry shows some issues.<br/>

Clicking the option afterwards does nothing.<br/>

In 3D there are two issues:<br/>
 * The border draws its side on the last segment<br/>
 * The border doesn&#39;t draw sides on the other segments and the hardscape geometry is hollow

<br/>
Not sure if this is a Renderworks issue or hardscape one. From the enclosed file and movie you can see that the hardscapes which are texture beds do not map correctly. If this is changed via the render tab of the OIP it doesn&#39;t update the model. You have to go back and forth until eventually it kicks it.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>

- Select both Hardscapes<br/>
- Open the Main Area Components dialog<br/>
- Change the component Thickness and click OK<br/>
<br/>
Note that one of the Hardscapes doesn&#39;t seem to take on the change, but if you reset it the change will then take effect.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in VW 2022, but if I go back to VW 2021 I don&#39;t see the problem.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it might be Mac-only.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Select both objects and run the Clip Surface command<br/>
<br/>
Note that it works fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
- Now Undo the clip operation<br/>
- Edit the &quot;Hardscape&quot; layer and change its elevation to anything other than 0&quot;<br/>
- Run Clip Surface again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the clipped area shifts and rotates randomly.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens with Add Surface.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this problem in all files so it looks like there&#39;s something specific about this Hardscape that&#39;s triggering it.<br/>

This file was created in VW 2023, but if I export to VW 2022 I see the same problem there.

Main issue he was noticing has to do with editing the crop of a viewport. When editing the crop, if he goes to rotate the geometry, it immediately snaps back to its original position. Only when exiting the editing window, does the viewport make the change.

<br/>
The customer wants to define the working plane with 3 points along the sides of an extrusion.<br/>
However, when activating the tool in the three-point mode. The cursor snaps to the sides of the extrusion, as expected. But when clicked, the tool doesn not register that point as a refrence point for the working plane. It only registers the click when this click is on an object-corner or &quot;mid&quot; points along the sides. If not one one of these points, and instead on a more random point along the object-side the click is not registered. This limits the possibilities customers have to create &quot;random&quot; working planes.<br/>
<br/>
It can currently be worked around by first placing loci along the object-side to refrence your &quot;random&quot; points. And then going back in with the &quot;set working plane&quot; tool to use these loci as your points.

<br/>
Callouts have a font, so it&#39;s confusing to a user why this doesn&#39;t work. The font happens to be a very important attribute of that object type since Callouts are essentially just text with a leader.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Along these same lines, clicking on a Text object with Select Similar doesn&#39;t select any Callout objects that have the matching font.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I don&#39;t think any of the Select Similar tool&#39;s &quot;Text Attributes&quot; work in regards to Callouts. This should be fixed so that the tool works as expected.

Starting with version 2022 Vectorworks now requires an account and authentication to use the desktop application. Unfortunatley Vectorworks uses an embedded chomium browser version 84.0.4147.89 (which was released 2020). Our (BNP Paribas Group) internal proxy blocks any request coming from an outdated browser which now prohibits us from updating to a newer version of Vectorworks since our users are not able to authenticate. Would you be able to include an updated version of the embedded chromium browser to comply with our (and probably many large companies) security policy) I also tested with version 2023 SP5 which resulted in the same issue.

                MVR from Capture not importing correctly

<br/>
When the attached MVR is imported the geometry comes in with different scales. <br/>
All the default geometry objects in the file are in a much larger scale than the objects that are named objects in the import dialogue (identified in the Scene description xml as trusses, pipes and lights). <br/>
If the MVR is partially imported with only the identified objects everything works as expected, witht he trusses, lights and pipes displaying correctly but is the default geometry is imported (either as a full import of everything or afterwords as a partial import) the default geometry comes in at a completely different scale (unusably large compared to the lights and trusses).<br/>
<br/>
From Talking with Jazz most of the default geometry seems to be from a DWG hat was imported into Capture as the files starting point. In capture this all looks correct with everything having the same scale.<br/>

When I attempted to reshape the extrude with the 3D dragger, the textures on the extrude do not stay. Either whole extrude or part of the extrude turns white, or it changes to one texture. <br/>
<br/>
This occurs if the profile is fixed. The textures stay applied if the profile of the extrude is not fixed.<br/>
<br/>
In previous version 2023 SP3, the same issue occurs with reshaping the extrude, even if the 3d dragger tool is not available in that version.

<br/>
That happens because one of the extruded contours clogs the other extrudes below it. The contour is filled because it cannot fully contain the hole defined by the retaining edge (&#39;extruded contour not covering hole.png&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
This is an example case in which we cannot just add a boundary extrude which would cover the hole, because it would also cover other extrudes from below elevations.

it is about layer colors in sheet layer section viewports.<br/>
It is more a question than really a bug.<br/>
Me personally would rather use data visualization than layer colors.<br/>
<br/>
Now to may question. On design layer the layer colors are working. In a SLSVP there is no fill. I have selected to use the object fill in attributes of viewport.<br/>
But layer colors are no object fill, so maybe it is not intended to work in a section viewport. But why is there  no fill? I would expect either the original object fill or the layer colors? And why is there no possibility to override the layer in viewport layer overrides dialog windows?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the answer and Gruß, Klaus Lüttich.<br/>

I have a problem here with the orientation of the objects. if I copy objects out of the left symbol and paste them back in the construction layer, they have the orientation construction layer. If I copy objects out of the right one, they have the orientation 3D. The symbol is the same, the only difference is the construction height of 100 meters.<br/>

A few users have stated that while working, when coming back to a design layer from a sheet layer, the view automatically changes to a top view. They stated they have this problem in a few documents, but it seems to happen pretty randomly. So far it seems document-related.<br/>

I received the document from the customer and can recreate the problem in 2022 (version the docuent was created in) and 2023. When trying the same workmethod in an empty document, the issue does not persist. Another customer only experiences the problem in Vectorworks 2023.<br/>

To fix this issue, you have to set the texture by Class again <br/>

 <br/>
 * Open test file<br/>

This is a problem when when you apply a texture on all wall components using the shortcut key &quot;Alt+Shift&quot; (Win)/&quot;Option+Shift&quot;(Mac). <br/>
<br/>
The dialog pops up several times. It is related to how many components are in the wall. If the wall had 5 components, then you have to click the OK button 5 times to finish applying the texture.

<br/>
I have come across a file in which textures seem to disappear when their objects are imported into a design layer. <br/>
<br/>
If the textures are set to be by component then the textures are totally missing. <br/>
- Changing the map type from auto alignment to plane and back auto alignment within the render tab of the OIP, seems to bring the textures back. <br/>
<br/>
If the textures are set to be by object then the auto-alignment doesn&#39;t seem to work. <br/>
- Changing the texture from class to none and back class within the render tab of the OIP, seems to bring the auto-alignment back.<br/>
<br/>
What could be causing this problem? <br/>
<br/>
Please see the video and files attached! <br/>

In the test file, when a new window is inserted, the wrapping looks as expected. If you remove the window from the wall and insert it back, the wrapping doesn&#39;t look as you&#39;d expect.<br/>
<br/>
Also when you right click the window and choose &quot;Plug in Object Options&quot; to open the dialog, notice the &quot;Wall Closure Name&quot; is blank. You&#39;ll have to select which wall closure to use. In this case, I am using &quot;Wall Closure 1&quot; for the window and &quot;Wall Closure 2&quot; for the door. <br/>

This could be related to VB-198138<br/>

The texture of the walls and slabs were set by component and material, the door and window objects by class, and the structural members by material. I had to double-click or in some way &quot;push&quot; each object again to display their correct texture. In the attached screenshot, you can see two slabs and one wall style that have their textures visible, and this is because I double-clicked them, forcing an update. I saved the file in the state that is shown in the screenshot, but I am not sure that it will appear the same once it is reopened.

If I set the stop at the bottom of the activated wall to 10cm (same as left right and top), the cutout fails. The insulation disappears or an error message appears. I do not know if it is the window (CW) or the wall (VW).<br/>

When the second window inserted into the wall, it causes the wall exterior wrapping to become incorrect. sometimes this effects both the exterior and interior wrappings. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It seems that many problems start with the exterior wrapping?

when applying texture from the Resource Manager on wall components, it is easy to apply the texture on the outside components. It is a bit difficult for this to work when applying the texture on the &#39;top&#39; side of the wall, unless you zoom in on the components.<br/>

Most users would probably be at a normal zoom, grab the texture and apply it on the components when the red highlighting is engaged. <br/>

<br/>
In the attached Vectorworks Document we have two walls.<br/>
<br/>
1. Top  Wall has an End Cap in Wall and no Openings (eg. Door).<br/>
<br/>
2. Bottom Wall has an End Cap in Wall and one Opening (eg. Door).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the Wall 1. we can see that the Worksheet calculates 0m2 of Wall Openings, since there are no Wall Openings.<br/>
<br/>
In the Wall 2. the Worksheet shows N/A and we have one Wall Opening. If we delete the End Cap in Wall and recalculate the Worksheet, then we can see that it calculates the Wall Opening, but it doubled the entry in the Worksheet, which it shouldn&#39;t happen.

The problem is currently occuring in the attached document, and gets worse when you update the viewport again.<br/>

When you reset all plug in objects, the problem is resolved temporarily. But the customer tells us that the issue returns after a while.<br/>
<br/>
Also opening the document in version 2024 resolves the issue, but I&#39;m afraid that might have just the same temporary effect as resetting the plug- ins.

<br/>
Within the design layer &#39;Konstruktionseben_00&#39; the two windows should be red using the texture from class &#39;fensterrahmen&#39;. But the window inside the wall is yellow because it is using the override from the viewport -which is in the Ansich... layer<br/>
<br/>
From the Kons... layer edit the class, change the textures to cyan. The windows will be cyan  But the window in the Ansich.. layer has also changed to cyan even if it should be overridden as yellow.<br/>
<br/>
Switch to the Ansich... layer, edit the class &#39;fenste... and set the texture to red. The walls and windows  in the viewport become yellow, because they accept the override.<br/>
<br/>
But in the Kons... layer, the window in the wall is yellow, so it is using the texture from the class override, not the texture from the class.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds complicated, because there is no way to follow what is going on: the window in the wall uses the same texture in both layers. And that texture can be taken from the class or the override depending on where you are editing the class.<br/>

<br/>
In theory, this would present us with two different examples of fixtures, three with the mode and two without. Therefore, the symbol key would offer them as different fixture types. The user would need both types for accurate counting. Each type would also display its fixture mode.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, I have included three summary keys. One uses both symbols and plug-in objects, the second uses the symbols only, and the third shows plug-in objects only. The last one shows an inaccurate count of moving lights overall. The one showing symbols only has an accurate count but is missing the GDTF information. The first one shows symbols and PIOs as an accurate count for the symbols without GDTF and a corresponding inaccurate count for the plug-in objects.<br/>
<br/>
It appears to be showing only objects that have GDTF profiles assigned and is missing the two without the profile.

<br/>
The same hatches display correctly when zooming/panning outside of Annotations.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that if the hatch doesn&#39;t have local mapping (see 00:17) then it displays multiple times LARGER than normal, and if the hatch does have local mapping (see 00:25) then it displays multiple times SMALLER. These are both incorrect, though the latter happens to be more headache-inducing :D<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the &#39;multiple&#39; happens to be the scale of the viewport (for example, in my file the hatch displays either 16x too large or 16x too small while navigating, since the viewport is set to 3/4&quot; = 1&#39;-0&quot;).<br/>

Method: <br/>
 # Draw a square 1m x 1m at 0,0. <br/>
 # Extrude it 2m. <br/>
 # Place a light source (I tested both a Heliodon and a Directional Light). It seems that Point Lights won&#39;t cast a shadow onto the &#39;ground plane.&#39; <br/>
 # Examine the shadow: It starts both below and away from the object in the direction the light shines, as if the surface it is cast upon is below the object&#39;s bottom and the ground plane. <br/>

<br/>
Mostly seen on a curved surface, but also appears to happen on vertical surfaces as well <br/>
<br/>
If the texture is applied to the entire object this behavior doesn.&#39;t seem to happen <br/>
<br/>
Converting the object in question to a generic solid somewhat resolves the issue, by flipping the grass to &quot;grow&quot; out the correct direction, but the background color of the grass texture doesn&#39;t show on the surface of the generic solid. <br/>
<br/>
Some other object do not display this behavior however, like a directly modeled hemisphere object renders the grass just fine, as well as nurbs surfaces extracted from the objects.

<br/>
If you have some objects, 2D or 3D symbols or just objects, select and Modify&gt;Group and Modify&gt;Create Symbol the expectations are that if you edit that symbol the first thing you will encounter is a group.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as just one of those objects is a hybrid symbol, the group is not preserved when editing the symbol. This is especially problematic for users who want to put the group in a container class for visualisation as opposed to another class for the symbol.<br/>
<br/>
I have checked as far back as I can which is v2017 and it seems nested hybrid symbols if part of a group, the group is not preserved within the symbol.<br/>
<br/>
File and movie enclosed. You will see in the movie that there is something not right with the &#39;Replace Symbol&#39; dialogue but eventually it works.<br/>

<br/>
As you can see in the two screenshots, the 2D loci that are present in the Top/Plan preview of the symbol are different sized depending on what monitor I move VW to when I create the preview. With the program moved to the Thunderbolt the 2D loci are small, but when the preview is generated with VW on the iMac the loci are much larger. This is important because I setup this content to show the loci so that the users know where the insertion and snap points are so it needs to be visible. The loci are the correct size when the symbol is viewed after being placed on the design layer so it appears to be a issue that arises when the preview is generated in the RM

There are end of steps.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce situation.<br/>
<br/>
0)Set drawing unit=mm, scale 1/50.<br/>
1)Creat a wall with thickness 150mm.<br/>
2) Select the Window tool and insert a window into the created wall.<br/>
3) Select &quot;Sash Opening&quot; from the OIP &quot;Size Reference&quot; dropdown.<br/>
4) OIP &gt; Change width value to &quot;1000&quot;.<br/>
At this time, if you measure the size of the window with the dimension line, it will be &quot;1000&quot;.<br/>
5) OIP &gt; Turn on the &quot;corner window&quot; check, and select &quot;Corner Post&quot; at the OIP &quot;Corner Condition&quot; dropdown.<br/>
6) Measure the size of the window again it will be changed to &quot;1050&quot;.<br/>
However width value still displayed &quot;1000&quot; on OIP. <br/>
<br/>
*As long as I tried, I see this problem then Vectorworks 2022. <br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Sample230207.vwx&quot; was offered by the user who reported this problem.<br/>
Here, you can see two types of problems: when the corner window is set, the size of the window increases, and when the size of the window decreases.<br/>
<br/>
・The window on the left page of the sample file is<br/>
　The width of the window is set to 4040.<br/>
　When applying the &quot;Corner window&quot; setting style and measuring the width with the dimension line, it becomes 4000.<br/>
・The window on the right page of the sample file is<br/>
　The width of the window is set to 1000.<br/>
If you turn on the &quot;Corner window&quot; check and measure the actual width with the dimension line, it will be 1050.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached movie and files. (13094.mov, Untitled 1.vwx and Sample230207.vwx)<br/>

FWIW I did try toggling the &quot;adjust flipped text&quot; pref, but it seems to make no difference. Granted, I did this after noticing the problem. Could that have any effect?<br/>

Enclosed is a 2023 file and when opened in that version or converted to 2024 the same problem happens.<br/>
<br/>
In the Annotation group of a viewport there are some text blocks that have been mirrored. Thus their rotation in the OIP reads 180º. They look correct on the screen because &#39;Adjust Flipped Text&#39; is checked in the &#39;Advanced Properties&#39; of the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
However when exported or published to PDF these text blocks are flipped and thus they do not look how they look on the screen. <br/>
<br/>
Please see the enclosed movie as well.<br/>

Cheers,<br/>

We send a short video illustrating the situation. <br/>
First of all, check that in your Vw the 2D Conversion Resolution is put to Very High and Details in Shaded Options to Very High as well.<br/>
The test involves creating a curved polyline and another very similar one at a small offset distance. Now select them and call the command Clip Surface or Combine into Surface to get the surface between the two polylines.<br/>
It is really important that the offset distance is very small compared to the size of the curves. For example, you can start from circles of 15 m in diameter with an offset distance of 2 cm.<br/>
On a macOS machine, as you can see in the attached video, you can perceive an evident imperfection in the curves obtained by zooming in.<br/>
The customer reports serious imperfections reported by a cutting plotter.<br/>
On the Windows platform this is less noticeable. However if you extrude this annulus and use the Extract Tool to extract the annulus from the 3D Extrude, serious defects reappear, even when you have to click to extract the surface (see at the image attached)<br/>
We attach a Vw file so you can try soon.<br/>
The same results are obtained with Vw 2023 SP3 and Vw 2022 SP5.<br/>
The (long-standing) customer is pressing hard for a quick fix. Please what do you think?

I have attempted to make opacity changes to the class which was active when the object was placed, as well as directly to the object. I have also attempted to edit the 3D geometry of the object and make those objects less opaque, but the opacity setting is greyed out. Also attempted to change the class settings for the None class which is the defaulted class of the geometry within the object. <br/>
<br/>
This has been attempted in the proxy representation and the level of detail representations.<br/>

I have not uploaded a file because it seems to replicate no matter what file I have tried it in, including a file with just one Laubwerk object.

<br/>
One of our customers was testing the IFC export and had the issue reported in video, below is the link:<br/>
<br/>
[http://www.vectorworks.com.br/temporario/arq_cli/IFC_Export_Bug_-_Cristiano_Pedott.mov]<br/>
<br/>
Basically, sometimes Vectorworks can export and sometimes not, it&#39;s very inconsistent.<br/>
<br/>
We checked and we had a similar bug with the stairs tool that was fixed in SP5, and he updated to see if that specific bug is fixed, and he still has the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything we can do or just report this bug to the Vectorworks people?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much!

I do two time the same steps using an empty document in an us-version.<br/>
First run I do not set a user origin and second run I do set a user origin by clicking into the drawing after geolocating.<br/>
NTV2 transformation (you have to put the command into your workspace first) fails in my second run.<br/>
Obviously transformation fails when there is a user origin.<br/>

<br/>
attached you find a VW 2024 Beta file,<br/>
with some further instructions.<br/>
<br/>
The Deform-Tool sometimes won&#39;t bend 3D geometry as expected.<br/>
<br/>
In my example, you can see that the 3D geometry is indeed bendable,<br/>
but there are some intermediate steps, before you can bend the 3D geometry.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a lot easier, if the bend works direct from the 2nd step in the file.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know, it this is a BUG or a WISH.<br/>
I placed task as a BUG (VB)!<br/>

<br/>
In the enclosed file there are some 2D symbols of trees. Their opacity has been overwritten in the Attribute palette. They look very transparent on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Sheet layer that has two identical viewports. One is in Top view and the other Top Plan.<br/>
<br/>
If you export to PDF, note that the viewport that is in Top view, all the transparency has gone (see enclosed PDF). Either the WYSIWYG is wrong when in Top view or that there is a bug in the creation of the PDF. <br/>
<br/>
If the symbols definition is edited to have opacity, then when in Top view the PDF will be correct, it is only when overwritten by the Attributes palette.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Peter

<br/>
I checked on an example of their brand orange colour and I can see inconsistency in how we display the colour codes -  the colour was sent to them described as<br/>
R:255 G:74 B:1 HEX: FF4A01<br/>
C:0 M:80 Y:94 K:0 Pantone 1655 C<br/>
<br/>
When I input above RGB to VW, CMYK is different. When I input the HEX CMYK is different. When I choose from Pantone, all other are different. When I input the above in Photoshop, all the numbers are exactly the same. <br/>
<br/>
The colour that visually looks correct (comparing to customer&#39;s colour palette) on my screen is when I input using CMYK in VW, while the others are visually the same to me, this is the only one that looks different. The colour from Photoshop also looks to be correct.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way for customers to correctly input supplied colour codes and get accurate result in Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can place the channel in 3D, with it still selected, go to Render in the OIP and choose a texture to apply but it will not show it.<br/>
<br/>
I found the only way to apply a different texture was to create a class using a texture and place that object on that class.<br/>
<br/>
The OIP seems to indicate you should be able to apply a texture to one Channel through the OIP<br/>
<br/>
I have tried on other objects like I-Beam-3D with the same results.<br/>

Some problems with tile filling being used in a wall and a slab. After exporting a file using file-export-dwf/dwg procedure file renders with minor problems where walls are cut by the window. The same problem is present when exporting the same file as a worksheet.<br/>
After reimporting these files back to the Vectorworks as dwgs, the file exported directly from a workspace renders exactly the same it is in a dwg viewer, but the file that was exported by a worksheet-publish procedure renders with many additional elements (duplicated tile filling).<br/>

[Window] Warning: Window NSWindow 0x336124130 ordered front from a non-active application and may order beneath the active application&#39;s windows.{code}<br/>
I suspect this is the reason why we&#39;ve been having issues showing floating palettes after launch on Ventura.<br/>
It appears it&#39;s no longer acceptable to show windows when the application is not active.<br/>
This may happen if the user switches to another app while VW is launching.<br/>
We probably need to revise the system so that palettes are shown when the main VW window is first activated.<br/>

<br/>
1. Open the attached sample file.<br/>
2. There are 2 Section-Elevation lines: one is crossing the extrude, and the other is not.<br/>
3. Move to the sheet layer (Sht-1). There are 2 section viewports. The left one was created from the section-elevation line that was not crossing the extrude, while the right one was created from the section-elevation line that is crossing it.<br/>
4. Select both viewports. Click the &quot;Classes&quot; button on the OIP. Hide the “Grid” class and click OK. Then, go to the Viewport Class Properties again and show the “Grid” class.<br/>
5. Click the “Update” button on the OIP. The grid lines on the left viewport will be shortened.<br/>

I think in this case the palette should resize to a fixed height for the current width, since that&#39;s how it works when resizing it manually (in icons only mode it always has the right size to fit all buttons).

If you entered 3/4&quot; the spacing worked well in most instances and the Instrument Type column was correctly left-aligned.<br/>
<br/>
In the new Equipment Summary Key (in beta 5), Text Distance using the Key&#39;s border as its origin. While there is some merit to this approach there are a number of pitfalls that could be problematic for users. First, it is unnecessarily inconsistent with the legacy tool and users may initially find it confusing. Second, it requires more trial and error on the part of the user to establish the correct distance from the widest symbol (something the old method avoided).<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer the old method of using the symbol center as the origin.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Activate the Camera view<br/>
- Render in Shaded mode<br/>
- Now change any of the Camera Effects options in the camera&#39;s OIP<br/>
<br/>
Note that the change doesn&#39;t take effect until the render is &quot;bumped&quot; in some way (zoom, pan, flyover, etc).<br/>
<br/>
With the other Camera settings in the OIP, the render will update as soon as the change is made.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem when rendered in RW instead of Shaded.

The problem does not occur on the same hardware on the released Ventura (tried both 13.2.1 and, after upgrade of that partition, 13.3.1). So this is likely an Apple beta bug but it is worth tracking to make sure it is something they fix.<br/>

Time permitting I will check earlier VW builds to see if they are also affected.

                VW Crashes When Changing Active File After Updating Viewports
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test files are attached. <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open both files<br/>
- In File A, run the &quot;Update All Viewports&quot; command<br/>
- Immediately switch to File B<br/>
- After the viewports are finished updating, switch back to File A and zoom<br/>
<br/>
Note that VW crashes. Crash log is attached.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a crash in 2023 SP4 so this looks like a 2024 regression.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it might be Mac-only.

https://analytics.vectorworks.net/crashes?category=105864&amp;build=683036-vectorworks-mac<br/>
<br/>
Today I was able to reproduce a crash bug when creating a section viewport. It was a little disturbing that it can be reproduced in an blank file and 4 walls.<br/>
<br/>
Note: I work on the latest version of Monterey 12.6.2.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>
<br/>
1. See attached movie and follow exactly these steps.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Switching Projection changes the angle of view between Perspective and Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
1.Perspective&gt;2.Orthogonal&gt;3.Perspective and just by switching the Projection, the angle of view changes between 1.Perspective and 3.Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Open the sample file and check the position of the render camera.<br/>
2) Select the render camera and Activate Camera View.<br/>
3) If I switch the projection from Orthogonal &gt; Perspective, the starting point will move backward.<br/>
   If I switch to 2D/Plan, you will see that the camera has moved backward from its initial position.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* In the perspective view, if there is an object behind the viewpoint, the problem seems to occur.<br/>
<br/>

Saw this assert, and it just seemed weird enough to merit a little investigation. I attached a snapshot of the stack at the moment the assert popped.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s essentially opening a new doc, doing RegenerateMissingResourcePreviews, and for some reason VGM ends up looking at the current tool (there isn&#39;t one yet) data which it seems like we shouldn&#39;t be allowing.  (The assert is because there isn&#39;t any tool data.)<br/>

In VW 2023, note that the surface maintains the same detail level during the reshape.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2024, note that the surface shows a high level of faceting during the reshape, and it constantly flickers between high and low faceting as the cursor is moved.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We ran into an issue where graphical artefacts appear while navigating through the file in a perspective view. It seems like the walls have intersecting surfaces but moving closer to the design seems to improve the render. We were able to replicate this on our side as well as on users computer. <br/>
<br/>
We tried to turn off accelerated graphics, but it did not change anything. <br/>
<br/>
Origins seems to be fine as well. <br/>
<br/>
We changed Shaded quality to see if we would get any improvements with no luck. <br/>
<br/>
When user creates more information on the file it seems to be getting worse. <br/>
<br/>
Please see screenshots and the fille attached. <br/>
<br/>
I seem to be getting different results with different Mac OS. User is on 12.2.1 and it seems to show more rectangles on the other hand on my machine i get more lines/triangulation. <br/>
<br/>
User is on M1 Pro 16gb ram mac book pro. <br/>
<br/>
My computer specs attached as a screenshot. I don&#39;t want to raise importance as it does not stop user from working, but it stops user from presenting to clients using the design layer. We found that on sheet layer viewports it seems to be working better.

 # Open attached file (or any file)<br/>
 # Notice with Cast Shadows turned OFF, Lighting Devices and Projectors will travel through mesh objects (WAD)<br/>
 # Now turn Cast Shadows ON (under Root in Properties or File/Document Preferences/Rendering)<br/>
 # Notice Lighting Devices and Projectors will travel through mesh objects like before (BUG)<br/>
 # Making a minor edit tot the scene (nudge position of Lighting Device or Projector) often fixes the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The same seems to happen when going in reverse:  Starting with Cast Shadows ON (and working) and then turning Cast Shadows OFF.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Marked as Sometimes... should really be Most Times.  Just a small part of the time it seems to work correctly.  Slightly inconsistent as seen in the attached 3 videos.

 # Before doing anything, go to Vision Preferences.<br/>

 # Click OK<br/>
 # Test turning the Lighting Devices ON by selecting them in the Scene Graph - they should be working as expected<br/>
 # Go back to Vision Preference<br/>
 # Make a Change<br/>
 # Click OK<br/>
 # Test turning Lighting Devices again and notice most do not turn on when selected.<br/>
 # Making a change in Properties, while the Lighting Device is selected, seems to correct this issue<br/>
<br/>
Steps 2-5 are not required steps to reproduce the problem, simply showing this issue seems related to turning the Lighting Devices ON first.<br/>
<br/>
Not all Lighting Devices react the same as seen in the video.  Some Moving Lights will work with the DMX recording after this occurs, while conventional will not.<br/>
<br/>
This issue seems to require turning the Lighting Device ON (selecting in Scene Graph) before going into Vision Preferences and making a change.  <br/>
<br/>
If Lighting Devices are selected while going into Vision Preference and making a change, this also seems to keep the issue from happening to that specific selected Lighting Device(s).<br/>
<br/>
Found in Vision 29.0.0, but also seeing in Vision 28.0.4.  I can test farther back if needed.<br/>

Now in Advanced properties turn &quot;Display with clip cube&quot; ON. Note, the Alert says all objects will be included.<br/>

Update the viewport. It becomes blank.<br/>

After you see the bug, if you double click the viewport and Edit Design layer, then immediately exit back to the viewport, then update the VP, the bug gets fixed.<br/>

ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION<br/>
<br/>
In the attached video, in 2023 I turn off some lights for a specific viewport on a sheet layer.  You see the viewport go dirty, and those changes stick in the visualization palette.  I do the same thing with the same file in 2024, and the viewport does not go dirty, and the changes do not stick in the visualization palette.  If I were to update the viewport, the lighting overrides would not be apparent.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Colors are different when outputting PDF with printer functions and when outputting with Publish (Publish to : PDF).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*File*<br/>
*Please refer to the attached &quot;sample20230531.vwx&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
   I think the area circled in red is easy to compare.<br/>
   It is quite hard to tell, but there is a slight reddish tint to the publish.<br/>
<br/>
*I think it is easier to understand on Mac than Windows. (User is on a Mac.)　<br/>
<br/>
  The output PDF is also attached.<br/>
     01_Publish (Publish to : PDF)<br/>
     02_Export PDF<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*When I create a PDF using the printer&#39;s functions, it is output with the colors on the sheet layer. However, when PDF is output by publish, the color is slightly reddish.<br/>
<br/>
*We have confirmed the same result when we checked the previous versions (up to 2021).<br/>
<br/>
*I have been asked by a user if it is possible to publish (Publish to PDF) as seen on Vectorworks if the color change is a specification(WAD).<br/>

                Slab&#39;s component fill is not visible in a horizontal section viewport

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Reported by Grzegorz:<br/>
|In case of a wall and section viewport, if it is rendered as an object beyond view plane it is possible to render wall&#39;s component fill (hatch, solid etc).<br/>
In case of a slab there is no way to render top component&#39;s fill, even in a horizontal section viewport, which Users usually understand as similar like vertical section.<br/>
As a slab&#39;s top view there is a &#39;graphical attributes setting&#39;, which cannot be connected with slab&#39;s top component. This makes it very hard to create a proper BIM floor plan for interior design where top view on a slab reflects the top component of the slab, especially when materials are in use.<br/>
 <br/>
Files and clip included|<br/>
<br/>
This might be something between a bug or an improvement. In both cases it is kind of serious workflow issue especially for an interior design.

<br/>
1.) If you make a seating section,  using the seating section toolset. <br/>
<br/>
2.) Start off with a simple rectangle shape and a straight ahead seating focus.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Apply an angle of seating to it,   (10° for example).   <br/>
<br/>
4.) Check the &quot;Adjust Boundary with Angle&quot; in the OIP. <br/>
<br/>
5.) Mirror the seating section.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You will end up with something like the below:<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If &quot;Adjust Boundary with Angle&quot; is unchecked,  and then you mirror,  it behaves as you would expect.<br/>

A solution for the user could be here to get rid of categories which are not useful for the user&#39;s workflow, so the drop down menus would dynamically get bigger (like it did in version 2023).<br/>
In version 2024, this doesn&#39;t help, so the drop down menus keep their absurdly tiny width.

So when you change a texture in the settings of the custom cabinet (attributes) and give each element a different texture, all this information is lost if you subtract a solid. <br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround, but it&#39;s tedious:<br/>
<br/>
When you try to use the Texture tool, you get an error message saying &#39;texture cannot be applied to faces of non-history-based object&#39;.<br/>
When you convert the solid subtraction to a generic solid, the Texture tool works.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had a customer report that some WinDoor objects return approximately double the actual area values and some report zero, for glazed area and vented area. This is evident in worksheets and graphic legends. I&#39;ve verified this in the attached Test.vwx. The other file is from the customer which includes three WinDoor varieties affected by this problem. <br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The WinDoor &#39;Types&#39; verified so far are: <br/>
<br/>
*Affected:* <br/>
 * Overhead Tilting Door<br/>
 * Overhead Sectional Door<br/>
 * Overhead Folder Door<br/>
 * Combos featuring two &#39;RS Sliding Right&#39; and a Awning Hung in the fixed window, with &#39;EX Extend Down&#39; above all. As seen in one of the files included. <br/>
<br/>
*Not Affected:* <br/>
 * Overhead Rolling Door<br/>
<br/>
The user has also since provide a screenshot of sliding doors not being included in &#39;ventilated area&#39; values/calculations. See attached.

Please let me know if there&#39;s anything we can do to be of any assistance and have an awesome day!  :)

It is not actually the Outline font style being applied. The new shaped text receives the fill color of the text object that was configured before the operation. Similiarly, the Pen color previously configured for the text object is used as the outline color.<br/>
<br/>
This is confusing because some font style commands still behave as expected for text (italics, bold,...) but others, like the Pen color, behave differently.

Edit the Main Area Components and set a material to the first component.<br/>

Going into 3D, the hardscape has the texture from the material applied, although the texture in the Render pane is set to be By Object, not By Component.<br/>

This behavior is not present in SP0 build 665441, so I am not sure if it is correct.

To reproduce, in the Render tab of the OIP, toggle back and forth between &quot;By Object&quot; and &quot;By Component&quot; Modes.<br/>

Note that &quot;By Object&quot; mode shows the texture with a non-repeating pattern and inconsistent rotation (see second screenshot).<br/>

I&#39;m not really sure how the test this with pre-SP4 &quot;Aligned&quot; Hardscapes (it&#39;s pretty much impossible to get a similar shape) so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s specific to the T02357 task.

When the space label in 2022 gets unrotated before conversion, then the converted space label is fine in 2023.

We would like to ask you that our way is suitable to check or not.<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if it&#39;s incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Place the Lighting Device.<br/>
(Ex. Light Instr USITT 10BP)<br/>
<br/>
2) Check the OIP&gt;Weight is &quot;0.00kg&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3) Select the &quot;Spotlight&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Report&quot; command &gt; &quot;Lighting Symbol Maintenance...&quot; submenu command.<br/>
<br/>
4) Select the symbol selected in step 1) and click &quot;Edit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5) Enter &quot;50&quot; in the &quot;Weight&quot; field of the &quot;Edit Instrument Data&quot; dialog and close all dialogs with &quot;OK&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
6) Checking OIP&gt;Weight again, it remains &quot;0.00kg&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*After the above procedure, you can change the &quot;Weight&quot; by deleting the symbol in &quot;Lighting Symbol Maintenance...&quot; and re-registering a symbol.<br/>
However, this is valid only for Vectorworks2022, and it was not possible to change &quot;Weight&quot; in Vectorworks2023 even if the same procedure was performed.<br/>
<br/>

3) When I checked both VW2022 and VW2023,  The result on VW2023 is little bit darker overall.<br/>

                2024 Quick Preference icons are inscrutable

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      One of the things I like least about the new interface are the Quick Preference icons. They are small and their meaning is not immediately obvious. <br/>
<br/>
The worst/least legible are:<br/>
<br/>
—Show Clip Cube. The very worst. If I didn&#39;t know there was a Clip Cube Quick Preference in 2023, I&#39;d be hard pressed to guess what the dashed hexagon with a locus in the middle is.<br/>
<br/>
—Project Sharing Options. Looks like data tags<br/>
<br/>
—Show Other Objects While in Edit Modes. Again, I&#39;m having to rely on my pre-2024 knowledge of to interpret this icon. The old icon made sense because it incorporated the orange border that Vectorworks adds when one is inside a group/symbol/viewport annotation. But because all color is verboten now, this icon has lost its meaning.<br/>
<br/>
—Display Light Objects. The triangle over the light bulb obscures it&#39;s interpretation. Why have it?<br/>
<br/>
—Use Layer Colors. This one is ironic, as all three of the layers depicted are black, because, well, all the icons are black. At least make one of them grey? And why are there data tags again?<br/>
<br/>
—Show Page Boundary. The old icon with its border was more informative, this icon could just as well be a shortcut to page setup.<br/>
<br/>
This may be flagged as &quot;works as intended&quot; or an &quot;enhancement request&quot;, but if an icon doesn&#39;t serve its purpose (to give the user a clear and succinct signifier of what the button does) then it has failed and doesn&#39;t work. The evidence that the icons are flawed is that 2024 gives you a legend of what the icons mean, which 2023 and before did not need.<br/>
<br/>
This UIX is a large step backward, I regret to say.

Also (and this might be a separate bug) when there is no texture applied to the sweep the rendering is not correct with regard to the shading (smoothing maybe??) See the attached image with regard to the difference between a textured and non textured object.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When a file with a point cloud imported by a module such as Designer is opened in Fundamentals, it is displayed in 2D, but in 3D, it is displayed as a &quot;Extrude&quot; object without Fill, and the contents are not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;sample13160.vwx&quot;,&quot;13160_F.jpg&quot;,and &quot;13160_D.jpg&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* The attached image is rendered using Shaded.<br/>
We confirmed that the wireframe does not even show a frame line around the Point Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
* I checked the Vectorworks help, but I couldn&#39;t find any specific information that the Point Cloud data is not displayed by the module.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Question*<br/>
Is it a specification or a bug that point cloud data is not displayed in the 3D view in Fundamentals?<br/>
<br/>

                Georeferencing and VWX refrenced file bug

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Reported by Grzegorz:<br/>
<br/>
A VWX file imported as reference into georeferenced file has its geometry scattered and relocated.<br/>
VW2022 - it was possible to import a VWX file as viewport reference (without georeferenced layers, e.g. building) into georeferenced file (e.g. DTM) without any rendering issues.<br/>
<br/>
In VW2023 after SP2 the same process is impossible. It does not matter if a base georeferenced file is imported form VW2022 and referenced file is just updated or base georeferenced file is created from scratch in VW2023. In the end there is the same result in a form of scattered geometry of the referenced File.<br/>
<br/>
Att_0 - expected result from VW2022. DTM works fine and reads localisation correctly. Imported file is moved from 0,0,0 to proper location by hand.<br/>
Att_1 and Att_2 - File imported from 2022 and updated. DTM works fine, but building geometry is scattered.<br/>
Att_3 and Att_4 - File created in VW2023. DTM works fine, but building geometry is scattered.<br/>

<br/>
This one is largely reproduce-able in a blank file on first insertion.   Occasionally it doesn&#39;t do it.   After the initial performance hit,  successive inserts generally work,  but occasionally do not,  but I can&#39;t seem to pinpoint the cause at this point.   I&#39;ve also observed similar with the straight truss PIO,  but I haven&#39;t nailed down the steps to reproduce it reliably.<br/>
<br/>
But basically:<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a blank file (unsaved)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Insert a curved truss PIO.   Click once to set the insertion point, and then set an arbitrary non squared angle for it. (I think the bug hinges on this) <br/>
<br/>
3. Hit enter to accept the PIO defaults<br/>
<br/>
4. With the truss still selected, Immediately try to opt+= (or whatever activates the rotate tool in your workspace)<br/>
<br/>
5. You&#39;ll notice that the protractor get&#39;s stuck and there is no live preview of the rotate,  it&#39;s hard to tell if it&#39;s even attempting to work.<br/>
<br/>
Updating to add that if you switch applications so something else temporarily takes over your screen,  and then return to Vectorworks.   If you try to insert more curved trusses,  they will be super latent in their insertion and you are unable to preview the rotation.

By selecting all objects (cmd+A), moving all of them to the Site Model layer, moving all of them to the None class, copying them, opening a new file, and pasting them, the issue does not happen in the new file.<br/>

It makes us think it is related to layers/classes in some way, but by getting rid of all spare layers, classes and saved views in the original file, the issue still happens.<br/>

<br/>
When importing a USD file with the default settings (including “import as symbol”, the object seems to briefly appear on the design layer, then it generates meshes and subsequently disappears from the design layer. It can them only be found in the RM. I would imagine that this is WAD but it will catch users off guard: “Now you see me, now you don’t”Thoughts on having an instance of the symbol remain on the design layer?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I looked at import OBJ which has symbol behavior and it doesn&#39;t flash or affect the design layer like USD import does.  Maybe it creates its geometry differently.

The dimension markers are scaled when the checkbox “Export viewports as 2D graphics in model space” is active.<br/>
The file will be exported correctly if we uncheck it, however this implies that also the model area will be within the document, what is not always desired.<br/>

If you then press the corresponding letter that menu will open.  In this version of Vectorworks this only works if you press the ALT at the same time that you press the corresponding letter.  Not in sequence like most other programs and every version of Vectorworks prior to this one. <br/>
<br/>
The sequencing is important because you can follow the letters down to actual command you wish to use. But if you have to press the ALT+Letter your shortcut highlighting ends and you can&#39;t learn the sequence of the command deaper in the menu because it does not show you the underscored letters again.

                Hardscape Stake Modifiers Take-On the Wrong Elevation on Elevated Layers

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Create an Aligned Hardscape on &quot;Layer 2&quot;<br/>
- Enter the Surface Modifiers edit mode and add a Stake object<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Stake takes on a 10&#39;0&quot; elevation. This is relative to the Hardscape, so the point ends up being 10&#39;0&quot; above the Hardscape (a 20&#39;0&quot; world elevation).<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the Stake would pick up the exact elevation of the Hardscape at the point where it was placed, but according to the comments in VB-163789 that&#39;s not feasible. If that&#39;s not possible though, the Stake should probably just default either to 0&quot;, or to the elevation of the Hardscape (as shown in the OIP &quot;Elevation&quot; field). <br/>
<br/>
With Grade objects that are added in Surface Modifiers mode, the elevation always defaults to 0&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022.

- Create an Aligned Hardscape that connects to the Walls<br/>
- Now use the Edit Wall tool to edit the Walls as shown (move the endpoints upward, add a vertex near the center)<br/>
- Realign the Hardscape<br/>
- Enable the &quot;Interpolate Surface&quot; option<br/>
<br/>
Note that the surface shows a bunch of jagged points (see attached screenshot). The results seems to vary each time, where sometimes the peaks are more noticeable than others.<br/>
<br/>
If you delete the Hardscape and re-create it from scratch, the surface will then be smooth. So it seems like the process of editing the aligning objects and then realigning the Hardscape is messing with the interpolation somehow.

                Site Model: Smoothed contours could go outside modified area in Proposed+Existing display mode
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The issue here is with the &#39;2D contours (smoothed)&#39; in &#39;Proposed+Existing&#39; display mode.<br/>
Open the test file and notice that some of the proposed contours go outside the modified area.<br/>
<br/>
A little background:<br/>
<br/>
Due to the presence of &#39;internal&#39; modifications (that might come from the site model sculpting) we can&#39;t guarantee that there are clearly defined outlines of the modified area (sculpting doesn&#39;t provide explicitly outlined modified areas). Therefore, a special approach is needed for the &#39;Proposed+Existing&#39; display mode where all existing contours are displayed, while the proposed contours should only appear in the modified areas.<br/>
<br/>
Since we do not have clearly defined/outlined modified areas, we use the following approach to calculate the proposed contours:<br/>
- all existing and proposed contours are calculated.<br/>
- the two sets of existing and proposed contours are compared (as geometry) and are found those parts of the proposed contours that are not overlapped by any existing contours.<br/>
Thus, by finding the differences, we actually recognize the areas of modification through which each contour passes.<br/>
<br/>
Probably for the 2D smoothed contours, the steps to calculate the proposed (parts of) contours for &#39;Proposed+Existing&#39; display mode are:<br/>
1) - smoothed contours are calculated.<br/>
2) - the sets of found existing and proposed smoothed contours are compared.<br/>
<br/>
And it seems that the steps should be:<br/>
1) - contours (the non-smoothed ones) are calculated.<br/>
2) - the sets of found existing and proposed non-smoothed contours are compared.<br/>
3) - only then the resulting proposed (parts of) contours are smoothed.

All the affected walls may simply be corrupt, but I doubt that in this instance because:<br/>
 # The usual tricks to fix corrupt objects have not worked. <br/>
 #  The command works fine when the file is converted back to Vectorworks 2022. And after opening this v2022 file in 2023 the problem still occurs. <br/>
<br/>
*Description:* In the users file (supplied), select any of the lower level&#39;s outer walls. (Style: Brick 70 Ext). Run command, &#39;Convert Copy to Lines&#39; and choose &#39;Hidden Line Rendering.&#39; No object will appear. Walls on the upper level work fine and choosing &#39;Wireframe Rendering&#39; output with the problem walls works fine too. <br/>
<br/>
I tested many variables, including: <br/>
 * Checked Class visibilities to ensure the resulting object would be visible. <br/>
 * Copy-pasted one wall into a new blank document and retested there. <br/>
 * Manually change or remove all dependencies, including Wall Style, Object Class, Wall Components Classes, Class-attributed Textures, other OIP settings like height etc. <br/>
 * Toggled &#39;Bel Att Cls&#39; (See: [Attributes Below Cut Plane|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2017/eng/VW2017_Guide/Walls_edit/Editing_Walls.htm]) to match walls that function correctly. <br/>
 * Used the Eyedropper to pick up ALL settings, attributes (everything) from a wall that works with this function and apply them to the misbehaving wall. <br/>
 * Ran commands, &#39;Update Plug-in Objects&#39; and &#39;Reset All Plug-Ins&#39;<br/>
<br/>
None of them worked. <br/>
<br/>
I will update this task if any conditional variables are identified. If you find any please @mention me because the user will want a workaround if there is one. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

5) Place any 3D object in VW2023 and display it in 3D view.<br/>
6) Display the Radial Menu from the SpaceMouse programmer button.<br/>
7) When 4 menus set in Radial Menu are executed, it behaves erroneously as follows.<br/>
　Fit View: Top View is executed.<br/>
　Top View: Bottom View is executed.<br/>
　Switch Navigation: Fit View is executed.<br/>
　Switch Protection: Left Isometric is executed.<br/>

I consider this a bus, because if these field are available while multiple objects are selected, a user expect this to apply to all selected objects.<br/>
- Ideally, this option should function for multiple objects at the same time. Especially when you have a lot of existing trees (which is usually the case in landscaping projects), this functionality is necessary<br/>
- In case this it is not designed edit multiple trees at the same time, I&#39;ll submit a change request about this. But in that case, there&#39;s still a bug. The flields and/or buttons which aren&#39;t supposed to work on multiple objects, should be grayed out in case multiple objects are selected.

The behaviour is seen in v2023 and v2024. <br/>

This is a nuisance to users as they need to be able to define the specific parameters of each group of Stake objects they chose to import. It cannot be assumed each data import will be for the same purpose.

<br/>
I think the problematic surfaces are always within symbols, and only _some_ of the symbols display incorrectly, even when there are multiple instances of the same symbol definition.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT caused by me applying different textures or per-face texturing or anything like that. It&#39;s definitely a bug with which textures is being shown on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Closing and re-opening the file fixes it. But then a few hours later it&#39;ll return.<br/>

Another thing that often fixes it is simply editing the symbol then exiting it.<br/>

<br/>
we have the problem again when connecting to a GrandMA2onPC and Vision. VISION recognizes the dongle perfectly. This is valid and active. <br/>
<br/>
When changing the DMX provider to MA2net, the error message &quot;Can not open HASPA driver&quot; appears.<br/>
We have already tested these things:<br/>
 - Windows defender switched off<br/>
-VISION 2023 newly installed<br/>
 - GrandMA2 onPC reinstalled<br/>
 - ESC Vision plugin reinstalled<br/>
-All data deleted.<br/>
 - Reinstall WIN11 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No new dongle driver has been installed.<br/>
Which HASPA driver is supplied with VISION 2023 ? <br/>
There was the case that it only works the driver with version 3.11. As far as I know MA will not develop the plugin further. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get a connection on my computer either. Can you please check this ?  <br/>

publish seems not to use the page size of the listed sheet layers, but the page size of the current layer. See video.<br/>
In the testfile there are three sheet layers. All do have different page sizes. All three sheet layers should be exported to image file with the proper page size. This does work when you export them using command Export image file. This does not work using Publish. With publish the different page sizes are ignored. Instead the page size of the currently active layer is used. We consider this a bug.<br/>

<br/>
Scaling the entire screen defeats the purpose of using a higher resolution screen as effectively it gets dropped back to the equivalent of using a lower resolution screen. Which means less available drawing space.<br/>
<br/>
To give an example I currently use 150% scaling on my external 4k monitor that I run Vectorworks on. This is the optimal setting for most applications I use, and used to work fine for vectorworks. Using 2024 Its significantly harder to identify tool icons. The icons do not become easily identifable until the scale is set to 200%, but this then means the display scale has to be changed when i want to use any other application on that monitor, for example Camtaisa when I&#39;m creating video content. <br/>
so not only do I lose the benefit of my 4k monitor but I now need to constantly alter the screen scaling depending on what applicatio I&#39;m currently working in!<br/>
<br/>
TO2250 Requirement R2 states<br/>
<br/>
 *__* All controls should be easy to read on both small and large screens, as well as high-resolution and low-resolution screens.<br/>

I am not able to see this on Mac so one customer kindly sent me a screen shot where the issue is clearly visible. The anti-aliasing of the wireframe lines looks like an upsampled image. It does not actually make the lines look crisper but just blurred. A good comparison is when you export to pdf and look at the anti-aliasing there. But it is also blurred when compared to 2022.<br/>

I have been doing little Spotlight-Lighting work on the file until now so this is probably the first time I have tried to insert a Lighting Device. It works ok on a new file so it is just something about this file?! I send it nonetheless.<br/>

step by step<br/>
<br/>
1. open &quot;Testfile 9878.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2. You can see immediately that the two corner windows in the 2D plan are not connected.<br/>
<br/>
3. Edit the corner windows<br/>
<br/>
4. In the Settings window dialog, switch to the “Sections/Elevations” tab<br/>
<br/>
5. activate the checkbox for horizontal section &quot;Use automatic 2D representation&quot;<br/>
<br/>
6. Confirm the dialog with OK<br/>

<br/>
Now the windows look correct.<br/>

Our Windows CW developer has commented: &quot;it looks like Vectorworks can&#39;t handle the window not containing 2D objects, so it doesn&#39;t push the break in the right place. This must be reported to VWI. They can either fix it or maybe tell how the window can force VW to slide it into place.&quot;

In b1 I drew a vertical light pipe which is how I think this should work. In b2 I drew the pipe on the ground, which I think is WAD, even if that is poor design. <br/>
<br/>
I both cases when I created the SV, the SV showed four lights, not the eight drawn.<br/>
<br/>
In b2, after I created the SV, I attempted to stand the pipe up (90° hanging angle) and the realist is shown in the file and the screen grab; the lights are pointing every which way.<br/>
<br/>
I think in both cases the 2D alignment and 3D do not match.<br/>

This feature; has failed since first introduced. I know it is considered &#39;done&#39; but it remains all but useless. Create Plot and Model was a challenge to explain, but this???

For a consistant workflow all modes should behave the same and allow multiple loads to be managed at the same time<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The reason this command is so important is that currently once a load object is attached to a truss or pipe ther is no way to break the link except to delete the supporting truss or move the load objects onto another truss or pipe.

<br/>
1) Create a wall.<br/>

4) When you insert the created symbol into the wall, the symbol will be displayed at a position away from the wall.<br/>

*As long as I tried, this doesn&#39;t seem to occur in Vectorworks2023SP4.<br/>

*This problem does not occur when inserting a symbol of a window or door into a wall.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When creating a viewport using a Clip Cube, the color can be set from the Object Info Pattete&#39;s properties, but the color does not appear to change depending on the angle of view even if the setting is actually changed.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;Sample0417.vwx&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Viewports 1,2,3 were created with Arbitrary angle of view.<br/>
Viewports 4, 5, and 6 were created with the view &quot;Right Isometric&quot;.<br/>
Viewports 1 and 4 were created with Advanced Properties set to Default Settings.<br/>
For viewports 2, 3, 5, and 6, in the Advanced Properties, the Cap Fill Color for the clip cube is set to light yellow and the Cap Edge Color is set to blue.<br/>
Viewports 2 and 5 are set to Shaded in Render.<br/>
Viewports 4 and 6 are set to Final Quality Renderworks.<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*　The color of the surface is fine when viewed with the above settings, but the edges are mostly seen as black lines, although some parts of the edges appear to be showing normally depending on the angle of view.<br/>
<br/>
*　We also checked the behavior after changing the Line Thickness, color, etc., and confirmed that there is not much difference.<br/>
<br/>
*　We have also confirmed that the same problem occurs in v2020, which can now display clip cubes.<br/>
<br/>
 ■質問<br/>
任意の画角でも問題なくAdvanced Propertiesで設定した色でクリップキューブのCap Edge Colorを出す方法はありますでしょうか。<br/>
<br/>
*Question*<br/>
Is there a way to get the Cap Edge Color of the clip cube to be the color set in the Advanced Properties without any problems at any given angle of view?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

To test this you have to change the OS location and language to Germany and German.<br/>

Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Structural Member that uses By-Material textures.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open the settings dialog and go to the Attributes tab<br/>
- Change the Member texture to &quot;None&quot;, then choose &quot;Revert to Material&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the 3D Attributes list shows the wrong texture name/thumbnail at this point. If you move the cursor over the 3D Attributes list, the problem will fix itself.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this on Mac so it looks like Windows-only.

Data visualisation with criteria (texture is XXX) does not see autohybrids that have texture XXX is texture is added to the object inside autohybrid. If texture is added to the whole autohybrid then it works fine.<br/>

<br/>
Seems there are a couple of issues with the U-stair single wider return:<br/>
<br/>
Issue 1 - There is an artifact inside the U-turn that appears to be part of the stringer or structure of the stair. This is only visible in 3d views. On Top/Plan view is fine. To replicate please see the video attached;<br/>
<br/>
Issue 2 - If side 2 is reduced to 1801 mm and side 1 to 1050 mm, one of the step&#39;s threads moves back leaving the step without thread. This is only visible in 3d views. On Top/Plan view is fine. I believe this could be related to issue 1. Also, the lower connection to the floor creates an artifact that is only visible in 3d views. To replicate please see the video attached. <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if there is a workaround for these as the user who reported this is looking to design a stair like the one on issue 2. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

The moment you zoom in or out you get a grafik failure in Adobe.<br/>
It works using Vectorworks 20222. So this must be an issue with 2023.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
in our German version of Vectorworks we do no use parameter DBH.<br/>
Instead we use trunk perimeter which is measured at a height of 1 meter.<br/>
Well, when performing an import of a tree seurvey file, then the parameter trunk perimeter is missing and only DBH is available.<br/>
This is a bug. Instead of DBH there must be trunk perimeter.<br/>
And even worse. Customer do select DBH because there is no other option and the result is that all imported treed do have the default value of 0,9 meters for trunk perimeter.<br/>
Please make trunk perimeter available on import tree survey file.<br/>
See my video to reproduce this in an US version of Vectorworks.<br/>

- If you copy the same hardscape to another document, the clipping works as it should<br/>
- I tried to isolate the hardscape by deleting everything else in the document except that hardscape (objects, clases, (sheet) layers, resources), but the clipping kept on failing<br/>
- Creating a new hardscape with exact the same geometry: for the new hardscape, the clipping works as it should as well.

This isn&#39;t much of an issue with Windows and Doors, but the same thing now happens with Cabinets in VW 2024. In that case, being able to control class visibilities in the preview is much more useful (ex: hiding the door/drawer panels so you can see the shelves).

 # The viewport becomes un-rendered (displays as wireframe), which is highly annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a screen recording showing this. In my example, the background render is Shaded and foreground render is Hidden Line. Also note I&#39;m only nudging once by holding down the keyboard shortcut for a few seconds, I&#39;m not nudging multiple times.

Object Info Palette and dialogs (Create Viewport, Create Viewport style) use different controls for render modes.<br/>
One from OIP is correct, dialog version should be fixed: separator is not drawn, and it is possible to select it.<br/>
Because of this we have to add code in the core to avoid a wrong selection.

Medium and low quality exports seems to export everything however high and very high quality exports seem to start ignoring these small objects<br/>
<br/>
The wheel file is the customer&#39;s file and the STL export test is my test file.  I can replicate this in both files.<br/>
<br/>
The attached screenshot shows the wheel file exported from very high -&gt; low quality.  We have seen this result in 2 different splicing softwares and when importing back into Vectorworks.

<br/>
When using the Rope and Stanchion Tool in VW2024, the last segment of rope and last stanchion always appears to insert on an angle. The angle is seemingly arbitrary. The new angle is not reflected in the &quot;Rotation&quot; field OIP.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be a regression from VW2023 SP5. Unable to reproduce in Build 698306<br/>

<br/>
This causes at least two noticeable issues:<br/>
<br/>
The weight is not reported in the total weight of a Hanging Position or other objects and commands that utilize this field, as GetParamString() returns empty.<br/>
<br/>
The weight/length gets calculated from the stored total weight, but never the other way around. This can lead manual entry of weight/length to be ignored, with no feedback for the user, as well as for the weight/length field to reset when the object reshapes.

<br/>
In the movie you will see a custom Print preset being set up.<br/>
<br/>
Notably that in the Paper Handling part of the print dialogue the &#39;Scale to Fit Paper Size&quot; and &quot;Scale Down only&quot; buttons are not recalled. If they are *on* when the custom preset is saved, if you cancel and then return to the print dialogue and recall that preset these two fields will be {*}off{*}.<br/>
<br/>
In Monterey apparently this works as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
One issue are slow Workgroup references and one reason for that can be solids with modell-history behind them. I think it is normal, that history needs some more resources than generic solids but i am not sure if we have a bug here. It seems that some actions regenerate the solids also maybe referencing them. In one Project customer say it takes 15min but I can not reproduce. But what I can reproduce is a difference by 1000% between history-solids or generic solids.  <br/>
if I have the following test:<br/>
<br/>
1. Refreshing Document 106 in Document 901 takes 42 Seconds.<br/>
2. After converting the solids on 106 to generic solids, it takes 4 Seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Link to a further BIM Object (too big to attach). Here Referencing takes one hour because of the solids.<br/>
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0rtjrpevfkrne8z/AAANlMVyyrsdru1BayElUMV8a?dl=0<br/>
<br/>
It seems, that it is refreshing something in the Referenced Viewports which is should not do, or should it?

In this file, when activating the camera view, the viewfinder seems to be moved down and not aligned with the actual view. <br/>

Also when deactivating the camera view, this adjusts the view to a different one before activating the camera view.<br/>

Note: If moving the camera to a different layer it works fine. <br/>

As this is a custom camera, why does it show the standard tripod, lens, and camera body symbols in the OIP? <br/>

                Spotlight Video Screen: Shaded rendering problem when in perspective - looks as if coplanar with something else.

<br/>
This is similar to a bug I have previously reported about the Blended Screen:<br/>
<br/>
VB-165787<br/>
h4. Spotlight Blended Screens and OpenGL rendering<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes as in the enclosed file and movie, the screen image when rendered in Shaded mode appears to have interference as if there are co-planar objects, and it is particularly bad when in a perspective view. There is no geometry that is interfering with the Video Screen object.<br/>
<br/>
In fact the only way around this is to open a new file and add a new Video Screen object and manually transfer the settings and then paste back in as a replacement. So it seems as if there is some corruption in the object. <br/>
<br/>
I know this might be a one off except that it has happened in the Blended Screen as I have reported before, so I hope there is something that might be easily checked (if possible) so users do not have this complaint?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,<br/>

 # Looking at DMX Patch (or in OIP), notice Spotlight Number has assigned values to Static Accessories such as the C-Clamps and Barndoors<br/>

If Spotlight Number is run in Manual, user can select what accessories get patch information.  However, the Static Accessories still show in the DMX Patch, but as Unpatched.  Unsure if this is WAD, or possible VB/VE. <br/>
<br/>
Also seems like any accessory that shares the Lighting Device Insertion Point can not be selected in Manual mode.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a new issue, seen back in VW2022.

as you can see in the video / files, when ever I try to insert a connection between a truss corner and a normal straight piece, I get this lateral Offset message.<br/>
<br/>
This should be possible as this a way to work in reality.<br/>

I clarify this as a bug, because the red indication lines while connecting are misleading.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is intended, then change it to VE.<br/>

At first I thought there was a bug in that Light Objects would show outside of Clip Cube, but from what I have been researching this is Work as Design as long as they aren&#39;t selectable?<br/>
<br/>
However, I came across an issue where Windows and Door in Walls could be selected using Marquee Selection that where outside the Clip Cube.  The selection seems to only occur when the objects in the Clip Cube are not selected, other wise they are deselected.<br/>
<br/>
The attached file is saved in the same state where the video starts, so the issue can be easily recreated.  Using Edit&gt;Select All will not show this issue, must use Marquee Selection.<br/>
<br/>
Tested back to VW2023 SP4 and seen there.  If needed, I can go back farther.

- The GetTaggedDataXXXArray() flavor functions (ObjectRef, ColorRef, Byte, Uint32)<br/>
- The GetOrCreateTaggedDataXXXArray() flavor functions (ObjectRef, ColorRef, Byte, Uint32)<br/>

The above functions return a mutable pointer retrieved from {*}gSDK-&gt;TaggedDataGet(){*}.  Ideally, these getter functions should return a const pointer.  If the data should be changed, then it should be changed through a call to {*}gSDK-&gt;TaggedDataSet(){*}, so it can be tracked for CTS purposes

Attaching screengrabs of two different error messages that I get when attempting to use the AMT on EAPs (not sure why I sometimes get one and sometimes get the other, and sometimes I get both in succession).<br/>

Also attaching a file of an example where I want to use the AMT to quickly align the soffit panels on an EAP object, but I&#39;m out of luck...<br/>

This is one of the many caveats/exceptions/idiosyncrasies that has driven me crazy for years in Vectorworks. It&#39;s rather mystifying as to why these little roadblocks still exist every step of the way.

I replaced the section lines from unstyled to Section-Elevation Line from the Vectorworks library - See image attached for clarity.<br/>
Happy that the markers were now visible, I exited the viewport annotation and was on sheet A2.1.2<br/>
At this point vectorworks crashed.( It just out and out disappeared from the screen. <br/>
I had to wait several minutes for VW to generate a crash report.<br/>

                Heliodon with &quot;physical sun&quot; seems to produce multiple schados under specific conditions.

- &quot;physical sun&quot; is checked on in the OIP for the heliodon object<br/>
- In the Renderwokrs style used, the background is set to a renderworks background with a physical sky<br/>
- &quot;indirect lightning&quot; is enabled in the Renderworks style<br/>
- &quot;nvireonment ligntning is NOT set to &quot;current background&quot;, but to &quot;none&quot; or to a non- physical backround.<br/>
<br/>
When you render an object with shadow, you will see multiple shadow segments in slightly different colors. As if the heliodon contains multiple light objects.<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a very specific bug, but for us it is quite an important one, for the next reasons:<br/>
- Many Renderworks styles in our localized libraries contain indirect lighning and a physical background as a sky, but no environment lighning. Because most of the times, the physical sky gives an evironment lightning which is way too blue.<br/>
- The heliodon is placed with &quot;physical sun&quot; enabled by default. Disabling it is something the average user won&#39;t try<br/>
- this is a new issue since Vectorworks 2023, in version 2022 this problem didn&#39;t exist.

<br/>
Next, the user selects *Edit* *[shader name] Shader* to directly edit one of the shaders that makes up the applied texture.<br/>
<br/>
The issue at hand is the string for *Edit* {*}[shader name] Shader{*}, which is Edit ^0^1 Shader... This is problematic for localized versions because the resulting dialog box title will appear with an awkward grammar construction.<br/>
<br/>
*Recommendation:* replace the string containing the variables with full strings for the corresponding dialog box titles. I&#39;m informed by our localization engineer that there might be numerous combinations of these ^0 and ^1 variables in the dialog box title.

<br/>

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1. In the Vectorworks preferences, set Default 3D view Render mode to Shaded, as shown in the screenshot. <br/>
!image (16).png|thumbnail! <br/>
2. Activate clip cube<br/>
3. Vectorworks crahses<br/>
Or...<br/>
1. Open the attached file and just switch the render mode to Shaded and Vectorworks will crash.<br/>
<br/>
The same is seen also in the latest (as of the time of the submission of the bug) Mainline build 700636 and is only happening on Windows.<br/>
This issue is the root cause of a crash seen when a user sends this file for VGX export on the cloud.

However now if Vectorworks is open with the Home Screen, and you restart the Mac you are not able to. A message comes up saying that you have to quit Vectorworks first.<br/>

This might be the price we pay for the Home Screen but it is nonetheless regressive. If the Home screen is not showing but Vectorworks is open the Mac will restart as expected.  It&#39;s just that the Home screen stops it.<br/>
<br/>
Expected behaviour would be that Vectorworks should quit irrespective of the Home screen visible or not?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

3) click-drag + ALT the inserted window out of the wall<br/>

Contrast this behaviour with inserting windows into walls and taking them out:<br/>

If we select the wood-like grouped NURBS objects like its shown in the video, we can see that the Vertice Points are far away from the object, that is causing for the Group Bounding Box to be too big.<br/>

On the other hand, if we select the pillow object that is also a grouped NURBS, the problem described above does not happen.

Like it is shown in the video, some objects are displayed in a section viewport, although their class is off.

Texture mapping of wall objects created with the Wall tool do not apply the texture assigned to &quot;Holes&quot; in &quot;By Object&quot;, but the texture assigned to &quot;Left&quot; is applied.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Create a wall.<br/>
2) Assign different textures to &quot;Holes&quot; and &quot;Left&quot; in the Render tab &gt; Texture of the Object Info palette for the wall.<br/>
3) Put a window into the wall.<br/>
4) The texture assigned to &quot;Left&quot; is not applied and the texture of &quot;Holes&quot; is applied.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Reported by Annelien:<br/>
<br/>
The customer in this case wats to model a type of &quot;projector&quot;. This is pretty challenging for the light-rendering it seems.<br/>
Light is spilling from the wrong sides of the model and causing an inaccurate rendering.<br/>
<br/>
The customer first used 5 3D-polygons to shape the projector. I suggested they model it with the &quot;shell solid&quot; tool on a simple extrusion. This already aided the rendering quite a bit. The big problem is that the point light sources seem to have a certain &quot;size&quot; which in some cases clips through the &quot;projector&quot;-model&#39;s sides. This causes light to &quot;spill&quot; through the solid sides. When zooming in on a light source, the icon and selection gets rescaled, so there is no way of really knowing this &quot;size&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The issue does not persist when using a &quot;spot&quot; lightsource. These render just fine. The issue with the point lightsource can sometimes be solved by centering the source on the model again. But as soon as your &quot;projector&quot; model hits a certain small size, the issue persists again.<br/>
<br/>
This problem might just be caused by limits of the rendering-abilities. But reporting it seemed smart

 * Name the current Settings mode Omniverse Connector Tool Preferences<br/>

This problem does not happen on SP3 as you can see in the attached video.<br/>

When you create a window in a wall and as second a recess at the same position, the hatches from the wall are over the window. If you create first the recess and then the window, the result is not the same. I couldn&#39;t find a way to change the order of the objects after they were created.<br/>

See attached screen grab. When I grab an object and drag it using the selection tool, the objects alternatively disappear, half disappear, or mis-render. Executing a quick zoom in/out with the mouse wheel resolves the issue.<br/>

This applies to changes using move, move by points, and changing coordinate info in the object info palette. Weirdly, the regular &quot;move...&quot; command does not seem to be affected.<br/>

Any object in the drawing space is affected, regardless of object type.<br/>

<br/>
I have a renovation / phasing related conundrum from a customer - these are two demolition plans on a Sheet Layer, one is a Top/Plan Viewport, the other a Horizontal Section. All objects have a phasing record with Existing, Proposed and Demolition, and a Data Viz setup for each view. For some reason, Horizontal Section does not apply the same graphic override via Data Viz (none for all attributes with RF value Proposed) as a Top/Plan Viewport, so you can see some Doors floating around on the HS, but they are not displayed on a regular VP. Also Door pen is changed to red colour on the VP, but not on the HS, but Walls for example are displaying just fine on both. Data Viz does not apply correctly here, but I can’t quite figure out whether the problem is in Top and Bottom Cut for 2D components, or is it Hidden Line maybe?<br/>
It feels like a bug, just not sure if it’s a bug of HS or Door or Data Viz or something else.<br/>
<br/>
To see the issue flick between Phasing - Existing, Phasing - Demolition and Phasing - Proposed data viz. Then have a look at Sheets 1001, 1101, 1201 and 1301  <br/>
<br/>

In the enclosed movie and file and screenshot you can see that the data is somehow doubled up, in other words showing twice.<br/>
<br/>
The movie shows that when I move one of the dynamic text blocks the doubling up looks like the text is on top of another line (when it is only the one block) then afterwards in the file it looks as if the text is repeated in the same line. Either way it gets repeated.<br/>

<br/>
See the following in attached video:<br/>
 # Open attached file (Export to VW2023 from VW2024 PS Working File)<br/>
 # Zoom in and out of Top/Plan to see the L shaped Polyline fill bleed appear and disappear<br/>
 # When in a 3D view, this fill bleed is always present<br/>
 # Un-Checking Closed in OIP removes this bleed (not what I would expect?)<br/>
<br/>
Reproducible using the line tool to close area and use Modify&gt;Combined into Surface (Corner Vertex)<br/>
<br/>
Not-Reproducible with using Modify&gt;Clip Surface (Arc Vertex)<br/>
 # The difference between the two polylines produced from these two workflows was the type of Vertex: Corner &amp; Arc<br/>
 # However, other polylines in this file that are Corner Vertex don&#39;t show this issue.<br/>
 # If Corner Vertex Polyline is changed to Arc Vertex, the bleed issue is resolved, but all the corners have a 1&#39; radius arc.  So they loose the 90° inner corner.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of variables which seem to affect the inconsistency. Firstly the Zoom scale percentage will make a difference and so also will the position of the window in relation to the centre of the wall thickness. This can be seen in the image which shows the same objects rendered in Hidden line at different Zoom scales. You will also see two separate windows (in two different walls in the image. One has a different Wall Offset value to the other and this can make a difference as to whether the tag appears in front of of buried with the wall face. (You will see that the tags have been made large in relation to the window in order to get a better idea of what is happening.

In the enclosed file there are two Saved Views. If both are edited you can see that they use the Vectorworks Preference setting for the Saved Views animation transition which is 2 seconds smooth.<br/>
<br/>
yet if you invoke the saved views they are instantly changed - there is no transition. This file was originally a 2022 file (and goes back to 2016).<br/>

These lines do not show up in the model when it is rendered in Shaded with Show Edges turned on. See screenshots and file.

<br/>
colleague came up with this problem:<br/>
<br/>
He had set the &amp;#x27;End Marker&amp;#x27; to active, drawn some lines.<br/>
<br/>
Later he added / moved Lighting Pipes and all of sudden they had markers everywhere flying around.<br/>
<br/>
Took me a minute to notice the marker setting being still turned on.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, the Pipe itself has no option to turn the marker off, the marker setting cannot be activated. So there is no option to deactivate them with a simple click.<br/>
<br/>
Complicated workaround: Deactivate the marker, select the pipes, edit a field and edit back. Then the marker disappears.<br/>

This occurs when &quot;ALL&#39; is one of the criteria.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, the 4 database rows contain formulae in the form:<br/>
=DATABASE( IF(LogicalTest, TrueResult, FalseResult) )<br/>
where the TRUE and FALSE Results are criteria expressions, like ((T=RECT)).<br/>
<br/>
When both criteria expressions are of the form ((C=Demo)) or ((T=RECT)), the DB Row formulae do not get rearranged, and execute as expected.<br/>
<br/>
But, when one of the criteria expressions is &quot;ALL&quot;, all hell breaks loose (pun intended.) The presence of &quot;ALL&quot; in the formulae causes the terms of the IF statements to be arranged, and yet, no syntax errors are issued even though the statements are syntactically incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Terms within an IF statement should never be rearranged.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, the formulae with &quot;ALL&quot; in the mix work when the &lt;logical test&gt; evaluates as TRUE, but not when it evaluates as FALSE. After the terms get jumbled, it&#39;s truly amazing anything works at all.

<br/>
This is marked critical and QRT because we are also trying to get this customer to test our Project Sharing 2024 feature.<br/>
<br/>
This is related to  VB-193896 in that it is the same customer, with the same file and the same viewport. Please see the files uploaded at VB-193896  - as they are the same files needed to be looked at.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe this issue is something to do with the fact that the quality of the light in a file converted between 2022 &amp; 2023 is different. Please see the attached movie part 1 to see the effect that this has on the viewport and then see attached movie part 2 to see a demonstration of how the same issue can also be seen in the Design Layer view that the Sheet Viewport is looking at.

                Worksheet cells formatted as Dimension do not convert their values when document units change

<br/>
I incorrectly assumed that this format would retain the equivalent value of an entry after the document units are switched.<br/>
<br/>
For example, with Document Units set to Inches, I enter 24 into a cell. The cell will display 24&quot; (assuming Show Units is checked.) When I change the Document Units to Feet &amp; Inches, the cell will display 24&#39;0&quot;, and not 2&#39;0&quot; as I expected.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of a cell&#39;s format setting, if you type in a number with units (100 mm), it will interpret the entry and convert both the value and the units to the current Document Units setting (3.937&quot;, assuming the document is set to Inches), and the cell is automatically converted to a Dimension format setting. Unfortunately, the same courtesy is not afforded to Dimension formatted cells when the Document Units are changed. Only the unit suffix changes and not the numeric value.<br/>
<br/>
Expected behavior: Changing a file&#39;s Document Units setting will update the value and units of the numerical data in Dimension formatted cells to reflect the equivalent value in the new Document Units setting. This should apply to all Linear, Area, and Volume entires in Worksheets.<br/>

OS Windows 11 22H2<br/>
<br/>
After having started Vectorworks 2023 it takes few seconds and the laptop goes into standby mode.<br/>
Vectorworks 2021 and 2022 do run without problems. It is only Version 2023.<br/>
Any idea?<br/>
<br/>
Without docking station Vectorworks run like a charm.<br/>
It is only the combination docking station and Vectorworks 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Customer already did the following steps:<br/>
Graphik driver updated<br/>
Switch to internal graphic device<br/>
Hybrid standby mode deactivated via Registry<br/>
Reinstalled Windows 11 on that notebook<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen this before? What to tell our customer?<br/>
Because Vectorworks 2021 and 2022 and any other software of the customer are working fine. It is only Vectorworks 2023.<br/>
What infos do you need from the customer?<br/>
<br/>
Gruß, Klaus Lüttich <br/>

Looking at the screenshot (and also the file itself), we can see that the display quality of the VW2023 render is worst (more pixelated) than the VW2022 version.<br/>

See screen shot for details. <br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
<br/>
-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
-Create movie via the OIP. In &quot;Create Movie&quot; dialog, set the Duration and FPS to 5 and select &quot;Redshift Extrerir Fast&quot; and Quality set to &quot;High&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Save the movie to the desktop and let it render until the screen saver is enabled<br/>
<br/>
-This is where VW freezes/hangs while generating the animation<br/>

Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1) Open Vectorworks, publish something to the omniverse.  Use the nucleus navigator to confirm the file is there.  Login to the omniverse from Vectorworks if needed, this seems to only happen on the very 1st time.<br/>
<br/>
2) In the nucleus navigator, change the password for the omniverse account you used with Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
3) Go back to Vectorworks and publish something to the omniverse again.  You won&#39;t be prompted for a new password, shown a login failure, or given any other indication that something went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
4) Check the nucleus navigator for the new file from the last publish, it won&#39;t be there.

We would like to ask you that our way was suitable to check or not.<br/>
Please let us know if it&#39;s incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
1) Create an Extrude.<br/>
2) Click  the Render tab of OIP.<br/>
3) Expand the &quot;expand&quot; list in the OIP&#39;s Texture Browser item.<br/>
Then click &quot;None&quot; to select it.<br/>
4) From the texture list, select &quot;Texture&quot; and select any texture.<br/>
(Example.Brick broken joint 01&lt;brick attribute&gt;RT)<br/>
5) Select &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Export&quot; command &gt; Export USD(3D only) ... submenu command.<br/>
6) Click the &quot;OK&quot; with keep the default settings.<br/>
7) Open the exported usd format file with Cinema4D.<br/>
(Example.test.usd)<br/>
8) Select &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Export&quot; command &gt; &quot;USD(*.usda/*.usdc)&quot; submenu command.<br/>
9) Click the &quot;OK&quot; with keep the default settings.<br/>
10) Select the Vectorworks &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Import&quot; command &gt; &quot;Import USD (3D only)...&quot; submenu command.<br/>
11) Select the exported usdc format file and click &quot;Open&quot;.<br/>
(Example.cinematest.usda)<br/>
12) Click the &quot;OK&quot; with keep the default settings.<br/>
13) Select the &quot;View&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Rendering&quot; command &gt; &quot;Shaded&quot; submenu command.<br/>
14) I can&#39;t see the texture that applying to the object by me.<br/>
<br/>
*About step 7)<br/>
When I open the file exported with Vectorworks in Cinema4D, the texture is displayed.<br/>
So it seems there is something wrong with my procedure when exporting in Cinema4D or importing in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached files. (test.vwx, T02386 question2.mov, test.usd, cinematest.usda)<br/>

This customer is a Mac user. He prefers to export collada&#39;s on his Mac to reder them on antother windows machine later on, rather than ussing the live sync with Vectorworks on Windows.<br/>
While this workflow didn&#39;t cause any issues in the past, lately the textures don&#39;t seem to show correctly when importing the Collada in Lumion.<br/>
It is unclear whether this is a VW or a Lumion issue. I report this here, for in case the issue can be resolved on Vectorworks&#39; side.<br/>

After updating to the newest version of VW, all my grades only show slope and arrow, spot elevations on each side are not visible. Seems like the only way to fix it is to select the grade - click settings and say ok. This fixes it, but you have to do them one at a time. I have HUNDREDS and multiple projects that are currently under construction. Need a fix for this pronto.

The Horizontal DLSVP renders with inaccurate geometry compared to the DLSVP on the same layer. Looks like the rendering effect is not as accurate? <br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
<br/>
-Open test file <br/>

-Update both the Horizontal SVP and the DLSVP <br/>
<br/>
-Notice the rendering inconsistencies<br/>

This is nota huge deal although I thought I&#39;d log it as a bug.

<br/>
Depending on how the Saved Views are changed, there are inconsistencies with when the blue highlight via the Navigation Palette changes, as well as the notification in the Message Bar. Steps on how to re-produce are below.<br/>
<br/>
1)Select a Saved View via the Navigation Palette.<br/>
<br/>
2)Select a Saved View via the View Bar dropdown menu.<br/>
<br/>
3)Use your keyboard shortcut to either move forward or back a Saved View.<br/>
<br/>
4)Notice that the blue highlight and message bar notification change/appear after the transition is complete.<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is different than if the View Bar dropdown menu was not used. <br/>

There appears to be a difference between Vectorworks 2022 and 2023 in regards to supporting shadows with onboard video.  These onboard graphics don&#39;t meet the 2GB minimum requirements for entry level drawings in Vectorworks.  However, the fact Vectorworks 2022 works and 2023 doesn&#39;t, figured it was worth a report.<br/>
<br/>
User reported the issue using (Macbook pro 13&quot; 2018, 2,7 GHz Intel Core i7, Intel iris plus graphics 655 GB1539)  I also duplicated with a Mac mini Intel HHD Graphics 630 1536 GB.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a little tricky to describe...if you lock in on a snap point and zoom in at a constant speed, everything is okay.  If you lock in on a snap point, zoom a little, stop, then try to zoom again, you&#39;ve lost the snap point and the zoom jumps, significantly.  Sometimes, you can lock in on a snap point and it stays locked. <br/>
<br/>
In Vectorworks 2022 SP6 for comparison, once you lock in on the snap point and zoom, it stays locked and the snap point doesn&#39;t disappear.<br/>
<br/>
See attached video comparing Vectorworks 2022 SP6 to 2023 SP4 (691376).  I don&#39;t see this issue in 2023 SP0, SP1, SP2 or even SP3 with the near plane clipping problem reported in VB-192964<br/>

Strangely enough though, this image prop will always display super bright, even in for example a night render.<br/>
It seems like this is because the image prop&#39;s texture contains a &quot;glow&quot; for reflection. This makes the person &quot;shine&quot; like a moon, which looks very unrealistic in settings with dim light or when the image prop is standing in a shadow. The image prop&#39;s textures shouldn&#39;t contain a glow.

<br/>
Maybe the crash log has some clues as to why VW crashed? I&#39;ll keep adding to this report if I see it again.

<br/>
Now I found a situation where the Object Activation Highlighting frames go off and on without me doing anything. Plus the GPU on my MacBook Pro M1 Max goes up over 70% - again without me doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
To replicate (see video):<br/>
1) open the file LU_W-GG-A-5-CWD-flickering_v2023.vwx in 2023<br/>
2) do &quot;Activate all&quot;<br/>
3) click on a different application<br/>
--&gt; after a few seconds you will see the Object Activation Highlighting frames go off and on - again and again.<br/>
<br/>
This behaviour was replicable with VW27.0.6(679396) and the file LU_W-GG-A-5-CWD-flackern.vwx.<br/>

Some of the RGB values don&#39;t really match the RGB values listed in the brand guidelines, but more importantly, the whole palette looks paler than it should be. In the attached Vectorworks file and screenshot, the rectangles on the left show the brand colors with the appropriate hex values. The rectangles on the right were colored using the Vectorworks eyedropper tool within the color picker and pulled directly from the brand guidelines pdf. The colors on the right definitely look more like the brand colors than the ones on the left.

 # Note the section counts and chair arrangements.  Select the single chair Symbol in the Resource Manager.  Edit the 2D portion of the Symbol definition - ONLY CHANGING THE FILL COLOR.  When you exit the Symbol editing environment, every section will be rearranged and counts will change - though no chair dimensions changed.<br/>
 # Select a simple rectangular section, such as &quot;D.&quot;  Note its arrangement and count.  Click &quot;Settings&quot; in the OIP and then &quot;Yes&quot; in the dialog that opens.  WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING, click &quot;OK&quot; in the &quot;Seating Sections Settings&quot; dialog.  The section&#39;s layout will change and the count will change.<br/>
 # Select an oddly-shaped section, such as &quot;K.&quot;  Note its arrangement and count.  Click &quot;Settings&quot; in the OIP and then &quot;Yes&quot; in the dialog that opens.  In the &quot;Seating Sections Settings&quot; dialog, click on &quot;Seating Information&quot; in the List Browser and check the &quot;Number rows&quot; box.  Click &quot;OK.&quot;  The section&#39;s layout will change and the count will change.<br/>
<br/>
This is beyond infuriating.  The layout in the attached file took several hours to create.  Even simple changes like changing chair colors and displaying row numbers require HOURS of unnecessary work.  Clicking the &quot;Edit Seating&quot; button in the OIP, exiting the editing environment, and clicking &quot;Modify the boundary so that it fits all seats.&quot; has no effect on fixing the above issues.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE make this tool usable!<br/>

<br/>
I am currently working with a VWX &quot;signature project&quot; file (that was made prior to the recent shaded render enhancements). I noticed that the tree grates are reflecting the HDRI {*}a lot{*}. They are not modelled grates but rather simulated using a RW texture with metallic reflectivity.<br/>
<br/>
I inspected the Renderworks texture used by the grate&#39;s class and saw that its metal reflection is set to 80%. I want the grates to have very low reflectivity In Shaded… so I would expect that setting the texture to 0% Reflectivity would accomplish this, however even after doing so the texture still reflects. It seems that adjusting the reflection percentage has no effect on the reflectivity in Shaded mode.<br/>
<br/>
A link to the file I am referring to is available via the link below. The file should open up already zoomed in on the tree grates.<br/>
<br/>
[https://cloud.vectorworks.net/links/11edba1757b55ba1bf4812d7462326d1/]<br/>
<br/>
The texture is used for the class A_EF-Site-Grate<br/>
<br/>
The texture is Metal Iron Mesh RT<br/>

<br/>
The resource represents circles on the border of the hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
If you change Border Width to 300, the Stipple starts acting strangely. There is only one circle instead of many and it is placed wherever on the hardscape, not just on the border. The circle can even go outside of the hardscape boundary for different recalculations of the object (&#39;hardscape stipple goes outside 1.png&#39;, &#39;hardscape stipple goes outside 2.png&#39;).

In the enclosed file you&#39;ll see two extrudes with a 100% mirror texture on. With an HDMI and/or a Physical Sky, the Renderworks background is reflected.<br/>

Flat photo or when using one or two tone colour Renderworks Backgrounds, these are not reflected in the mirror.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Enter the Viewport&#39;s Annotations<br/>
- Move one of the Data Tags<br/>
<br/>
Note that the leader line remains connected to the Window.<br/>
<br/>
- Now enter the Annotations for one of the legend cells<br/>
- Again move the Data Tag<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the leader line appears to get disconnected from the Window, but if you exit the annotations and then re-enter it&#39;ll then be connected again.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2023 SP0.

I am not sure if this is the cause for that, but its the only correlation I could find for this situation. Please take a look at this.

More and more customers are using the data tag to tag objects. Existing Trees is no exception. This is bogged down because of the line, that doesn&#39;t disappear.<br/>
<br/>
Only when unticking &#39;Auto Number This Tree&#39; and removing the text from &#39;Full ID Number&#39; does the leader turn invisible while the control points remain. That does not sound like a sensible idea for removing the leader.

Therefore, it is misunderstood that Wall Framer is created only for the wall of that class.<br/>
*On the other hand, the Windows version does not have a check mark.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Run the Vectorworks AEC menu &gt; Framing &gt; Wall Framer command on your Mac.<br/>
2) Enter an arbitrary name in the &quot;New Framing Model&quot; dialog and click the &quot;Create&quot; button.<br/>
3) Click the Options button in the Wall Framing dialog.<br/>
4) Add a checkmark to the class displayed in the &quot;Name:&quot; pull-down at the top of the &quot;Wall Class&quot; dialog. <br/>
*Windows does not have a check mark on the class.<br/>

Also incorrect are the highlighting, snapping and the temporary render while I&#39;m zooming in and out. I&#39;ve attached a video showing how I created the extrusion and one where I switch between different rendering modes.<br/>
<br/>
The extrusion I made using a path consisting of two 3D lines and a 3D polygon profile. I have both the fix profile and lock profile plane options enabled. I used this set of options, because I wanted the extrusion to always have a &quot;flat top&quot; (hope that makes sense). I wasn&#39;t able to reproduce this issue using any other combination of settings. But all other combinations of settings also yielded an extrusion different from what I&#39;m trying to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming this is not a regression, as I was able to reproduce it in 2020.

<br/>
if you are working in a document on one moment te image starts to scale.<br/>
If you open a new one everything go&#39;s wel. But one moment in time the scaling starts if you export to pdf.<br/>
Looking in to Vectorworks everything is fine.... exporting to PDF de image and lines looks scaled. And even te same image on the same type of object some to scale some not.<br/>
this problem started when 2021 came in. Now in 2023 the problem is still there<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
opening a new file the export can go well.<br/>
after a while exporting a file te export go&#39;s wrong.<br/>
you can see the files in the attachment.

 <br/>
<br/>
We ran into a problem when applying class overrides on viewports and then trying to render them using renderworks it would remove most of the textures. Working fine using shaded. <br/>
<br/>
When selecting a viewport in the attached file and editing all of the classes within it to have a black pen colour 2 things happen. The colour is not applied to some of the classes but as well when we are trying to render it with fast renderworks for example, some of the textures disappears. <br/>

                KLS: Update of SLVP from Clip Cube changes the displayed view

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
see my video.<br/>
I was wondering if i should report it at all because the customer does not work the recommended way at all.<br/>
Customer wants a horizontal section on sheet layer. He is using clip cube. So far so good. But instead of creating a horizontal viewport he is creating a simple viewport.<br/>
I think this is not the recommended workflow because when you switch clip cube off and then on, the section plane is gone.<br/>
But nevertheless, updating such a viewport should not let wall (or elements of that viewport) disappear and reappear whenever you click update.<br/>
That is why I create this report.<br/>

<br/>
If I have point cloud with country coordinates at Vectorworks origin and enable the option &quot;always import to Vectorworks origin&quot;, it imports to user origin and not to Vectorworks origin.<br/>
<br/>
I have a point cloud at country coordinates (Switzerland) and one at 0/0 (00). When I import the 00 all points come and it is at coordinates 0/0. When I import the Switzerland many points are missing and the plan is messy. The plan is also in nirvana at the country coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
In the attachemend you can find a point cloud with country coordinates and one with 0/0 (00).

 * open [^Light Not Showing.vwx]<br/>

Notice z-fighting-like artifacts.   This can be fixed by turning off Shadows, or by making the extrude at least 20mm.  Putting an object below the extrude to expand the model bounds fixes the problem too.  Seems like maybe artificially expanding the model bounds by a small amount might fix this. <br/>
<br/>
See attached. Zooming in and out causes the beam of light hitting an extrude at the ground plane to flicker. You can also see the affects in rendered viewports when changing the scale slightly between renders.<br/>
<br/>
Changing graphics acceleration and vector-caching made no difference.

It does render on my MacBook pro, however (specs also attached). The Section Viewport on Sheet &quot;View 1.2&quot; (main room section) renders correctly on both machines.<br/>
<br/>
The Section Viewports reference a Design Layer Viewport itself referencing a separate model file. The model&#39;s DLVP is ≈10x10^7 feet diagonally; Centering the Drawing on the Internal Origin reduces that by roughly half.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the issue with this file is the distant internal origin, but I have been unable to track down what geometry is responsible for the vast extents. I am also attaching the source file.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When the &quot;unified view&quot;  is turned on, if the thickness of the 3D object is thin and the object in the background touches or is close to the thin 3D object, depending on the angle at which the object is viewed and the magnification of the screen, it may be seen through.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1)Go to  File menu &gt; Setting document preferences &gt; Document Preferences &gt; Legacy 2D tab&gt; Make sure &quot;Turn off unified view&quot; is unchecked.<br/>
<br/>
2) Set &quot;Layer Scale&quot; to 1:50 and place a rectangle on Layer-1.<br/>
<br/>
3) Create layer-2, create and place &quot;extrude&quot; with a height of 5 mm so as to cover the rectangle created in layer-1. (Class Options are &quot;Show/Snap/Modify Others&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
4) Set Right Isometric view, and Shaded rendering. 2D objects (rectangles) under 3D objects (Extrude) may be displayed incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
*In the sample file (Sample230124.vwx), rectangle and Extrude are drawn on separate layers, but they may be reproduced even when drawn on the same layer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* The problem was confirmed in Vectorworks2019 or later.<br/>
<br/>
* If I check &quot;Turn off unified view&quot;, some objects will be hidden in the background　correctly. Some of the things on other layers and adjacent things such as 3D objects are shown through.<br/>
<br/>
* If the thickness of the &quot;extrude&quot; is extremely small, or depending on the magnification or reduction ratio of the screen, objects behind the screen may be hidden or displayed.<br/>
<br/>
* The state where the thickness of the “extrude” is small is 1 mm at 1/100, but there is no particular threshold.<br/>
<br/>
* When the magnification of the screen of the sample file is 100%, if the extrusion&#39;s value of the extrude is set to about 15, it will not be visible.<br/>

                NURBS Curves/Surfaces Become Corrupted After Converting Symbol to Group
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a NURBS Surface and a NURBS Curve placed inside a 2D/3D Symbol. The design layer has a 10&#39;0&quot; elevation.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, select the Symbol and run the Modify/Convert/Convert to Group command.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Shaded and RW representations of the NURBS now show at a 20&#39;0&quot; elevation, while Wireframe and Hidden Line still show at 10&#39;0&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the elevation of the Shaded/RW render will always be twice the elevation of the Wireframe/Hidden Line render.<br/>
<br/>
The only way I could find to fix this was to use Rebuild NURBS to rebuild the objects completely.<br/>
<br/>
This happens with all NURBS Curves/Surfaces in all Symbols.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022 but I don&#39;t see this in VW 2021.

<br/>
The enclosed file will have the design layers rotated by 90º.<br/>
<br/>
If you Export to PDF Sheet 2 you will see that the drawing produced has also rotated by 90º. In fact it will be rotated about whatever the rotation angle is on the design layers.<br/>
<br/>
If you uncheck &#39;reset all PIOs that require resetting&#39; the PDF sheet produced is not rotated, as is expected.<br/>
<br/>
The cause of this weird result is the Instrument Summary on the layer &#39;Tina Lx hung&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Even if deleted and a new one placed it will produce the same strange result. Note that once exported, if you go back to the Instrument Summary it will be blank and will have to be refreshed.<br/>

I have tried rebuilding using layer import into a new file to no avail.<br/>

<br/>
The default size of the openings from windows and doors is from my point of view too big. Users expect the opening object to be as large as the largest wall thickness in the area of the opening. For corner windows, a separate rule is needed: the opening object should have to completely cut out the adjacent wall.<br/>
Why is the size of the opening object important? In coordination processes, the opening object is used from time to time for model comparisons. Now the opening objects intersects for example with columns that are in the space.<br/>
<br/>

-Open the test file and update the section viewport then render in Shaded mode. <br/>

-Switch to Top/Plan view. Notice this operation take a while for the new geometry to generate. <br/>
<br/>
-After the horizontal section is visible (this may take a few minutes), try to movie it to a different location. This will take a while too<br/>
<br/>
-Switch to a 3D view (this should be fast) then rended in Shaded again<br/>
<br/>
-Switch to Top/Plan. Note the delay come back again<br/>

                Hidden line render: smoothing angle behaves random in perspective views
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The &quot;smoothing angle&quot; in the &quot;hidden line render&quot; settings seems to function very logical in orthogonal views. for example (see test file and video): with a setting of 20°, a line will be drawn at 21° and no line will be drawn at 19°. That is how it should be.<br/>
In a perspective view, though, it behaves very unpredictable. As you can see in the customer&#39;s document and video, sometimes 90° angles are even not rendered in a perspective. We do recommend customers to use a 20° angle to prevent complex looking and slow renders.

I have here a customer file, was was saved by an illegal version of Vectorworks and (naturally) could not be opened any more.<br/>
Is it possible that you convert that file for. us (ComputerWorks Germany).<br/>
What do you need from me other than the file?<br/>

                Hatch issue: &quot;Skipping Pen Black HF&quot; repeats poorly

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I have two objects on a sheet layer using the &quot;Skipping Pen Black HF&quot; hatch from the Vectorworks Libraries. The one on the left has &quot;Local Mapping&quot; checked (though none of the mapping values were altered). The one on the right does not have default mapping checked, it&#39;s just the default mapping that you get as soon as the hatch is applied. But this one looks funky and striated.<br/>
<br/>
Test file: [^SkippingPenHatch.vwx]<br/>
<br/>
I think the underlying issue is perhaps that this hatch wasn&#39;t designed to infinitely tile, so it starts to look weird the farther away you get from the hatch origin. That being said, we should get better results from default hatches.<br/>
<br/>
The issue was actually discovered when I was creating some elevations from a 3D model, using Surface Hatches. This is what I saw - note how stripey the top elevation looks compared to the bottom one:<br/>

                GetPointAndParameterOnNurbsCurveAtGivenLength failing for certain NURBS curves

<br/>
It seems to happen only when percentOfLength is fairly close to 0.0 or 1.0.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to create a file and a snippet of code that always reproduce the issue. File is attached to the issue. To reproduce it, I added the following code to the Debug-&gt;Test menu command:<br/>
{code:c++}<br/>
using namespace VectorWorks;<br/>
<br/>
gSDK-&gt;SetUndoMethod( kUndoSwapObjects );<br/>
<br/>
MCObjectHandle hPoly = nullptr;<br/>
for ( auto h : VWLayerObj( gSDK-&gt;GetActiveLayer() ) )<br/>
{<br/>
	if ( VWPolygon2DObj::IsPolyline2DObject( h ) )<br/>
	{<br/>
		hPoly = h;<br/>
		break;<br/>
	}<br/>
}<br/>
MCObjectHandle hNurbs = hPoly ? gSDK-&gt;ConvertToNURBS( hPoly, true ) : nullptr;<br/>
if ( hNurbs )<br/>
{<br/>
	WorldPt3 pt;<br/>
	double param;<br/>
	Sint32 index;<br/>
	TVWArray_MCObjectHandle arr;<br/>
	bool b;<br/>
<br/>
	b = gSDK-&gt;GetPointAndParameterOnNurbsCurveAtGivenLength( hNurbs, 0.22576425948300805, pt, param, index );<br/>
	gSDK-&gt;SplitNurbsCurveByPoint( hNurbs, pt, false, false, arr );<br/>
	if ( arr.GetSize() == 2 )<br/>
	{<br/>
		MCObjectHandle hh = arr[ 1 ];<br/>
		b = gSDK-&gt;GetPointAndParameterOnNurbsCurveAtGivenLength( hh, 0.13434296560338491, pt, param, index );<br/>
		arr.Clear();<br/>
		gSDK-&gt;SplitNurbsCurveByPoint( hh, pt, false, false, arr );<br/>
		if ( arr.GetSize() == 2 )<br/>
		{<br/>
			VERIFYN( kPGeorgiev, gSDK-&gt;GetPointAndParameterOnNurbsCurveAtGivenLength( arr[ 0 ], 0.99991070875791122, pt, param, index ) );<br/>
		}<br/>
	}<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
gSDK-&gt;EndUndoEvent();<br/>
{code}<br/>
<br/>
It creates a NURBS curve from the polyline in the document, splits it twice and tries to get a point near the end of the middle &quot;segment&quot;. The VERIFYN in the end fails.<br/>
<br/>
And to make things even more complicated, moving the polyline to a location other than X=0, Y=0 causes the issue to go away...<br/>
<br/>
Happens in Mainline, haven&#39;t tried 28, but I&#39;d guess it also happens there.

If you wait long enough, it will export, but it&#39;s very slow.<br/>
The reason for this is that the mesh is big and Parasolid requires a lot of time to sew the faces.<br/>

May be it would be better to export the Site Model in different 3D Style.

 <br/>
 * Cables have numbers.<br/>

[CMP] this is a minor issue. The user can easily work around by changing the Number Display options in the OIP. I have also seen this in a new file created from the default template (attached).

 # Extrude a rectangle<br/>
 # Draw another rectangle on the side of the extrude using the automatic plane option<br/>
 # Create a viewport looking at it from the Top/Plan view<br/>
 # Set the viewport to be in Hidden line rendering mode top view<br/>

The drawn rectangle will appear as if it has an offset from the extrude. <br/>
<br/>
Is this working as designed and is there a way to explain this to the user? <br/>

Test file attached. <br/>

You can choose manual,  or any of the automatic,  L-R, T-B etc.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter.   I used these seatings:<br/>

Run the command and you&#39;ll notice that all of the seating sections with a &quot;seating angle&quot; value are now missing a seat.  Reducing the count to 167.   This doesn&#39;t seem to affect seating sections without a seating angle.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand why updating the section name value would force the seating to redraw in such a way.  If I manually type in a section name on each PIO it won&#39;t do this,  everything stays correct.<br/>

<br/>
There seems to be a problem when picking the side for the plant tag to be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
After changing the tag to be controlled by instance in the Plant Style, by selecting the Tag Display options between None, Left, Right or Center, the Left option cannot be selected.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
After some tests on 2023 SP5, I managed to put the tag to the Left, however then the Right option became the one that could not be selected.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This issue does not seem to be affecting the last service packs of Vectorworks 2022 and 2021.<br/>
<br/>
This issue is also affecting Vectorworks 2024 Beta4.<br/>
<br/>
The video attached shows the problem.<br/>

<br/>
The problem is that the popup is not refreshing with the new values when we have a multi-selection. If we follow the same steps but only select 1 plant, it will work. The bug is caused by the fact that the function _Boolean TParametricControllerHelper::UpdateListWidget(TObjEditWidget* pWidget, const SWidgetDefinition&amp; widgetDef)_ is not being called.

A workaround I was able to give the user was to try the plant path from scratch without intersecting the plants. This kept the multiplying issue from occuring.<br/>
<br/>
The user also tested the file in 2019 and the multiplying issue does not occur there when trying to move a plant object.

                TK BUG: Differences between Commands: &quot;Ungroup&quot; and &quot;Convert to Group&quot; with various objects
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team<br/>
<br/>
there are some inconsistencies between the commands: “ungroup” and “convert to group”.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a bug, or maybe it is more a combination of a bug + wish!?<br/>
I placed it here as bug!<br/>
<br/>
1. Command: “Ungroup”<br/>
<br/>
If you ungroup a Slab in a 3D-View you get “Generic Solid”<br/>
If you ungroup a Wall in a 3D-View you get one “Generic Sold” for each component of the wall, the solids are not grouped together<br/>
If you ungroup a Roof-Face in a 3D-View you get nothing, the object can&#39;t be ungrouped<br/>
If you ungroup a Roof, you get some Roof-Faces<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2. Command: “Convert to Group”<br/>
<br/>
If you try “Menu: Convert / Convert to Group”, in a 3D-View, you sometimes get different results!<br/>
<br/>
A Slab will be converted to: a “Generic Solid”, as with “ungroup”<br/>
A Wall will be converted to: a group of 3D-Polygons.<br/>
A Roof-Face will be converted to: a group of 3D-Polygons<br/>
A Roof will be converted to: a group of 3D-Polygons<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think there are too many mixture results with both commands!<br/>
The most flexible options we have, is with “Convert to Group” + Roof.<br/>
There we are asked what we want to get, but not what object type (3D-Polygon or Generic Solid) we want.<br/>
<br/>
Please overhaul the procedure to a more unify process!<br/>
If possible, always convert to group of &quot;Generic Solids&quot;, if child-objects<br/>
like &quot;components&quot; exist in the parent-object.<br/>
<br/>
The process of creating solids from 3D polygons is more complicated<br/>
when you have a bunch of different 3D polygons than the other way around!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ideal would be to have “Convert to Group options” (as it makes sense)<br/>
+ a option to choose what object type you want to get:<br/>
 - group of 3D-Polygons<br/>
 - “Generic Solid” OR group of “Generic Solids” if child-objects like “components” exist in the parent-object<br/>
 - group of Nurbs / Nurbs Faces<br/>
<br/>
Attached you find a VW 2024 file with some examples.<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
 * Convert the Polyline and the Round Tubing objects to Symbols<br/>
 * Open the SM&#39;s settings dialog and change the Member Type to &quot;Custom&quot;<br/>
 * Expand the resource selector for the custom shape<br/>
<br/>
Note that only &quot;Symbol-1&quot; can be used, while &quot;Symbol-2&quot; doesn&#39;t show.<br/>
<br/>
The Structural Shape symbols from default content use the same types of plugins and those work correctly, so it seems like this should be supported.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions, so this may be more of a with than a bug.

- You will get an error telling you that the serial number is incorrect. I tried this with several valid (G and E) serial numbers. So this error is incorrect<br/>
- You can ignore the error by clicking &quot;OK&quot;, so the installation continues. But after installation is completed, the &quot;Vectorworks2023.exe&quot; file is missing in the program folder.<br/>
<br/>
The user can solve the issue by using &quot;unattendedmodeui minimal&quot; in stead of &quot;unattendedmodeui minimalWithDialogs&quot;, but unfortunately is is the latter one with can be found the most easily in documentation/ forums.

<br/>
Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a few Cabinets that use each of the five Frame types.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Door/Drawer Reveal options have no effect on &quot;Inset&quot; Cabinets, which makes sense, but having the options available might be a little confusing to users. Ideally we would gray-out these options to show that they don&#39;t apply.

Also noticing the Source Input field in the Properties palette does not update after making any changes.  User must click else where in the Scene Graph and then back on the object to see the change or update.  If this needs an additional ticket, happy to do so.<br/>

Also tested and seen using geometry instead of Projectors for Video Source.

<br/>
In a blank file, create a round curtain wall. Delete one frame to make room for a door, and insert the door in that space (marking it as a curtain wall door in the door OIP). Alternately open the attached Test File and proceed to the next step.<br/>
<br/>
Now create a new wall peak. You&#39;ll see the missing frames along the top of the curtain wall.<br/>

Note this only occurs if you add or move a wall peak *after* the curtain wall door is inserted.<br/>

The Task Overview Document (T02378) says &quot; The icons used are the same icons used throughout Vectorworks for active document, user folder, and workgroup folders.&quot;<br/>
(Page 14)<br/>
<br/>
I tested with Vectorworks 2024b6 (717409) and the active icon color is different from other icon colors. (Mac only)<br/>
*The &quot;User Folder&quot; and &quot;Workgroup Folder&quot; icon color were the same icon color as the others.<br/>

 # Draw one section in the Design Layer<br/>
 # Click and Drag that Truss Circle piece to connect to either end - *Use &quot;+Ctrl&quot; or &quot;option&quot; to Copy*<br/>
 # The first time, the red connection highlight will show correctly displaying which direction the truss circle is being placed.<br/>
 # Repeat Step 5 to attach a third section of the truss circle<br/>
 # Notice that no matter how or where you move the curser, the red connection highlight shows the same direction and will not change.<br/>
 # It seems that either direction can still be made, the highlight just doesn&#39;t show correctly.<br/>
<br/>
If the truss circle is copied using Drag +Ctrl/option and placed to the side, when attaching the piece now the highlight will work correctly<br/>
<br/>
Possibly not just an issue with Copying.  I notice this at times when moving existing pieces as well.  However, slight different.  Can be seen at the end of the video.<br/>

Truss symbol doesn&#39;t seem to be a factor, tested several all with the same issue.

Draw a building with multiple walls.<br/>

<br/>
On the Mac, several seconds pass (accompanied by the beachball-of-death) before the wall accepts the window. On my machine the delay is between 3-5 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
This occurs regardless of the number of windows placed. Not the case with doors: if doors are placed in walls, there&#39;s a small delay at the first placement but subsequent placements occur almost instantaneously (though still with a very small delay).<br/>
<br/>
This has been the case for a few versions now. Earlier versions of VW allowed instantaneous placement of windows in walls without the need to wait for the window to be accepted by the wall.

<br/>
Currently the dialog you see, when you open the _Project Sharing..._ menu item while a saved Vectorworks document (vwx) is open, contains the following sentence:<br/>
{quote}Once a file is shared as a Project File, all changes (such as editing objects, layers, resources, etc...) must happen to the project through Working Files, which are clones of the master Project File.<br/>
{quote}<br/>
What exactly is a &quot;master Project File&quot; in contrast to other (non-master) &quot;Project File[s]&quot;? In my experience our customers call different files &quot;master&quot; or even &quot;mother&quot; files - yes, both also in the context of Project Sharing, but some in the context of referencing or Workgroup files.<br/>
<br/>
Communicating with customers is hard enough as it is. If there is a way to avoid unnecessary confusion and it is as easy as removing a single word, then I vote for removing &quot;master&quot; from this sentence.

When exporting a worksheet from Vectorworks (xlsx in my case) and overwriting an existing file it will first delete the file and then create a new one with the same name. that way the version history of the file is lost.<br/>
<br/>
Would expect to behave the same as the regular vwx file and just overwrite the old file while keeping the version history alive.<br/>

<br/>
When I close it, the values are not showing after several attempts. Then, suddenly, and without any changes, the values are visible. However, only parts of the input are visible in some instances. For example, I had written in &#39;Clay brick, 120 x 102 x 65 mm&#39;, and only the first part, Clay brick, is left.<br/>
<br/>
Is the list browser sensitive to commas?<br/>
<br/>
Then, the last of the three rows didn&#39;t show the input and removing and adding new data became a hit-or-miss regarding whether the data stayed.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, trying to remove the last row of presentation data didn&#39;t work until only one row was left.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to recreate the issue, but this time, the input stuck the first time. The other two issues were still there, though

<br/>
I recently encountered this issue on macOS Ventura only and the next day, a Beta Tester had a similar experience.  <br/>
<br/>
If for example Vectorworks 2024 is up and running.  Then, you decide to open a file in Vectorworks 2023, by drag-n-dropping the test file on the Vectorworks 2023 application file, it will open the file in Vectorworks 2024 instead of 2023.  If Vectorworks 2022 is the application that&#39;s currently up and running, it&#39;s not possible to launch and open a file in Vectorworks 2023 or 2024, it will open the file in Vectorworks 2022. (see attached video)<br/>
<br/>
-Launch Vectorworks 2024<br/>
-Drag an older file on to the 2023 SP5 application file, to open both Vectorworks 2023 SP5 and the file<br/>
-Result, file is opened in Vectorworks 2024<br/>
-Close Vectorworks 2024<br/>
<br/>
-Launch Vectorworks 2022<br/>
-Drag an older file on to the 2024 application file, to open both Vectorworks 2024 and the file<br/>
-Result, file is opened in 2022

I am not sure when this happened, but any inserted fixtures default to a GDTF Fixture Type 1. This causes problems with the MVR into Capture for example. My work around right now is to select all fixtures and set the GDTF fixture typeto NONE.<br/>

This might be because in the Horizontal Section Hidden Line Render Settings the option Display surface hatches is ON. This might cause this overlay of hatches.<br/>

<br/>
!image-2023-08-18-13-57-01-658.png!<br/>
<br/>
Now,  If I option drag this truss to make a copy and convert that copy to a single hanging position (object mode).  I named this position T1.   You&#39;ll see that its Z is still 20&#39;.   So far so good.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-13-59-17-260.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;ll duplicate this hanging position one more time (I renamed it to T2).    Let&#39;s take T2 and change it&#39;s Z value to 30&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-14-00-38-600.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
In a side view we see that the T2 hanging position is indeed @ 30&#39;,   10&#39; higher than the other two.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-14-01-42-068.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Now if you again take T2,   and THIS TIME,  with it selected we &quot;Change Trim Height of System&quot; rather than Z.      Let&#39;s change the absolute trim value to 10&#39;.   After doing so,  if you select the T2 position.  And notice the Z value is STILL 30&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-14-04-55-437.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Even though in a side view,  the truss did move to 10&#39; as you can see in a side view:<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-14-05-43-376.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
If you enter the T2 hanging position object,  you can see that the Change Trim command changed the Z value off the contained trusses -20&#39; (from the last 30&#39;) to get it to 10&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-18-14-07-10-256.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Clicking a hanging position should have its Z in the OIP reflect the actual trim height of the position.   Not have some strange offset applied to the objects inside.   Doing quick trim height checks by selecting the object and looking at the Z value would yield an erroneous value to someone on a show site in this case,  which isn&#39;t good.    And if there is an offset applied to the objects inside the hanging position,  this should appear seamless to the user.

- the Align Plane tool in the 3D Modelling tool set; <br/>
With this tool, you can align objects precisely in 3D space to the working plane (see: https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Basic2/Aligning_objects_to_the_working_plane.htm?rhsearch=align%20plane&amp;rhhlterm=aligning%20align%20aligns%20aligned%20plane<br/>
versus<br/>
- the Align Plane option in the View Bar, which is used to align the working plane to the current view.<br/>
<br/>
Since those two features have different purposes, they should have different names.<br/>
I&#39;d keep the Align Plane in the View Bar as is, but adjust the tool name:<br/>
from &#39;Align Plane&#39; to &#39;Align to Plane&#39; / &#39;Align Surface to Plane&#39; / &#39;Align Object to Plane&#39; etc.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-08-26-16-45-59-053.png|thumbnail! <br/>

Not only those features work in a different way, but they also use various icons. Hence, their names should be unique.

The Units, Organization, and Data Manager dialog boxes, to name a few, DO remember their screen position when closed and will reopen in the same position.<br/>

Expected behavior: ALL dialog boxes should remember their screen position when closed and reopen in that position for the remainder of the VW session.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open a blank file<br/>
- Activate the Site Modifier or Hardscape tools in Aligned Mode<br/>
- Draw an object<br/>
- Now open another blank file<br/>
<br/>
Note that the snap points from the first file show in the second file.<br/>
<br/>
- Now return to the first file and delete the Hardscape<br/>
- Create a new blank file<br/>
<br/>
Note that the same snap points show in that file too, and will show in all other files (new ones or existing ones that are opened) until VW is relaunched.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen with &quot;Aligned&quot; Hardscapes and Site Modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022 with Aligned Hardscapes.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens in VW 2024.

This seems to be because of corrupted print settings, because executing the attached &quot;clear print settings&quot; script solves the issue.<br/>
I post this as a bug, because I hope you can find the source of this issue, and as a consequence of that prevent similar issues in future versions.

In investigating an issue that was only occurring on Mac M-chip machines, and only in release, it was discovered that an uninitialized bool variable was defaulted to true on an M-chip machine, but defaulted to false on other Macs.<br/>

All other existing uninitialized bools may have the same issue.<br/>

<br/>
1) The spacing in the Load Combination: Dropdown window appears to be justified too far to the right.<br/>

2) The dropdown options have a grey box next to the text and white highlighting under the options. This is similar to the behavior in VB-197032.<br/>

This behavior is only seen on Windows. Screenshot attached for clarity.

I am reporting this from v2029 build 717608 but it has occurred for me in versions 2023 and 2022 as well. During this entire time and in all version, I have deleted my user folder more times than I can remember, so I feel like it&#39;s not related to anything stored in the user folder.<br/>

I realize this is fairly minor, really, but it would be great to get it figured out. Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
While testing the Laubwerk tool, I found out that some symbols show very winey 3D. They are sometimes no more than stubs. See screenshots. This is especially with the ornamental grasses from the library.<br/>
<br/>
Since the variations in possibilities pet symbol are so large. And therefore can create so many different vatiants it is impossible to really go by everything.<br/>
But I have found anomalies in using this tool. Sometimes the symbols do not show textures (see screenshots), but they do when we choose a different variation in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
This makes it very unpredictable what you get to see with this tool.<br/>

Though zooming in the 2D pane will begin showing the actual, available 2D editing handles, ideally the 3D control handles would not even appear in the 2D as they are misleading.

I discovered that the layer &quot;assen&quot; is causing this issue in one way or another. Whenever you make this layer invisible, the issue doesn&#39;t perform.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I manage to resolve the issue for good by editing the height of the layer &quot;assen&quot;, but as you can see in the video, this doesn&#39;t work always.

<br/>
It only shows when the lights are panned/tilted also.  This seemed to have some similarities to VE-103874 and VE-99869, so please let me know if this should be an Enhancement Request instead.<br/>

Please let me know if there&#39;s anything else I can help out with and have a great day!  :)

Interestingly, when filleted, these artefacts remain. They resemble a texture that gets smeared across the side faces as well.

<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure if this one is worth submitting because it looks like a simple case of certain objects being corrupt, {*}_however_{*}{_}*,*{_} as this is the second case like this I&#39;ve had this year and I don&#39;t recall it happening in all my years prior (though I suppose I may have just remedied them and moved on) I figure it is at least worth running by you to see what you say. <br/>
<br/>
Two seperate users, from different companies, two months apart, have experienced this problem: Some - not all - polygons with image fills applied, do not render when published to PDF. There were some subtle differences between these cases: <br/>
<br/>
Genevieve Mcgirr - Her file had various 2D objects with an Image Fill. Some rendered and published fine, but the others displayed very pixelated when zooming in/out (most notable in any 3D view) but not once zooming stopped and the view solidified - but this was notably slow. (I don&#39;t know how to define the difference between the rendered appearance while zooming/panning and the final render state, as it relates to Top/Plan or Wireframe or Shaded). <br/>
<br/>
Peter Dibnah - His file also had various 2D objects with an Image Fill. Some rendered and published fine. One notable difference is that objects with the image fill concerned showed no unusual pixelation or delay in rendering between view/zoom changes. They remained consistent throughout. <br/>
<br/>
Genevieve&#39;s objects were &#39;fixed&#39; simply by swapping the image fill to another image fill. Peter&#39;s were fixed by using the Eyedropper Tool to transplant attributes from &#39;healthy&#39; objects to the malfunctioning ones. - Note, that all attributes visible to me in the Attributes palette and in the &#39;Debug List View Ex&#39; window showed they were identical except in shape, so I presume they are corrupt but as there have been two similar cases in short time, wanted to give this to someone more qualified to assess. <br/>
<br/>
All files attached. <br/>
<br/>
Please @mention me with your thoughts or questions so I can update my users accordingly. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
<br/>

Normally this is a issue with low priority but unfortunately we&#39;re working on a project that imports furniture from an online platform. Because of the bug we cannot import these objects correctly. This is why you get a DWG file and not a Vectorworks file. But I guess it is not an import issue. I think it&#39;s a Vectorworks limitation.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce the problem.<br/>
 # Watch the attached movie first<br/>
 # Open &quot;Testfile 20230815&quot; to reproduce the problem<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is actually a low priority issue as mentioned. But because of our ongoing project we would be happy if you can check if there is an easy way to get rid of this limitation.

I opened his file in both 2022 and 2023 and experienced the same issue.  I found though that since he has multiple view enabled, I first disabled it to just see the sheet layer on its own. If I double click on the viewport to navigate to the camera view, then exit back to the sheet layer.  Updating the viewport produces a clean sheet with no ghosting.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached his file and a video from my machine using 2023 demonstrating the issue with multiple view enabled and then the same steps with it disabled.

While it is possible that both the 3DS and glTF plug-ins have identical bugs in their separate projects, I think it is more likely that both plug-ins are being handed bad UVs. For this reason, I think this is an issue that the core/rendering team will need to investigate.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * In the attached file, double-click the Subdivision object to activate the Edit Subdivision tool<br/>
 * Drag one of its edges<br/>
<br/>
Note that this causes a long lag followed by one of three things:<br/>
 * The entire system will crash (I duplicated this several times on my Radeon Pro Vega 56 machine)<br/>
 * There will be a long lag, at which point the drawing window will no longer respond. I can still draw objects but they won&#39;t show, and every new file I create/open will show a solid gray drawing window)<br/>
 * There will be a long lag, but VW will recover and you can continue working. Every time I see this, if I try the Subdivision edit a second time, I then get another lag followed by the failed drawing window<br/>
<br/>
So far this has been duplicated on four different Macs that all use Radeon graphics cards. The 102247 remote access machine uses a Radeon card and also shows the problem:<br/>

When saving the project file with this new class information i have checked &quot;Aslo commit changes to: Document Preferences and Settings + Navigation and View related document settings&quot; I also experiences the same for Spotlight Preferences - Lighting Devices - Parameters. Default value here for field &quot;Universe/Adress&quot; is &quot;/&quot;. If i change this to &quot;.&quot; This also goes back to &quot;/&quot; next time i open the project file. Precision the field remains /still shows &quot;.&quot; but if i change the lighting devices adresses or refreshes lighting devices they will change to &quot;/&quot; in the labels. If i go into spotlight preferences and just enter &quot;.&quot; again, and then refreshes, it comes back to my wish. Is this two expected behavior or is this wrong? (I hope this is wrong.) After some testing this bugs only appears if there are multiple users involved. If i have a file with only my user this looks normal. Step by step: Have a project file. 1. File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Spotlight Preferences 2. Lighting Devices &gt; Classes and Colors 3. Change the three dropdown fields at the bottom to something else. 4. File &gt; Save &amp; Commit &gt; Check all boxes under more 5. File &gt; Close and release 6. Open the VWXP file again (not the working file) 7. File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Spotlight Preferences 8. Lighting Devices &gt; Classes and Colors, now these fields has changed. Have a project file. 1. File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Spotlight Preferences 2. Lighting Devices &gt; Parameters. 2.1 Change the field &quot;Universe/Adress&quot; default value to &quot;.&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot; 3. Draw some lighting devices and apply a label legend, and DMX adresses. 4. 4. File &gt; Save &amp; Commit &gt; Check all boxes under more 5. File &gt; Close and release 6. Open the VWXP file again (not the working file) 7. Change one of the lighting devices DMX adress. This one will now show &quot;/&quot; between Universe and Adress. 8. File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Spotlight Preferences&gt;Lighting Devices &gt; Parameters. &quot;Universe/Adress&quot; field default value is still showing &quot;.&quot;. Double click and just enter &quot;.&quot; again. 9. Spotlight &gt; Refresh Lighting Devices. Now the lighting devices shows &quot;.&quot; again as intened.

In some way, I guess this is by design (the extrude remembers the original position of its 2D base), but the effect it has looks very buggy.<br/>
I think something goes wrong already after you rotate the extrude before you put it in the symbol. In my opinion, there&#39;s no need for the extrude to remember the original ration of the 2D form, or at least not in a way that it causes this issue.<br/>
But if this is necessary for some reason, it should be at least possible to extract correct dimensions from the symbol.<br/>
<br/>
PS: To be clear: I&#39;m not talking about rotated symbols, but about symbols which contain rotated geometry.<br/>

All the messages were removed, however the red dot indicator that shows on top of the Message Center envelop icon, was still visible (See WindowsMessages.png). <br/>
<br/>
Then, I decided to open the Message Center on the Mac.  The messages were gone as I expected, however the red dot was still appearing on the Message Center envelop icon (see MacMessageCenter.png).  I closed the Message Center/Home Screen on the Mac, opened again, thinking it might refresh the red dot on the envelop icon and it was still visible.  I closed and restarted Vectorworks, then the red dot was removed from the envelop icon.<br/>
<br/>
I understand Windows is on a timer of sorts, before the status of the envelop icon is updated.  However, Kamen wanted to investigate why the Mac required an update, before the envelop icon updated properly.

This current functionality is the main reason why I virtually never use this feature of the program. This is a shame as I would really like to!<br/>

- Square eave cut: the roof face&#39;s components colors will show in the IFC document.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them is really &quot;wrong&quot; (however I prefer the component&#39;s colors), but at this moment it is quite unpredictable what color will be assigned and that&#39;s confusing for the user. The eave cut type shouldn&#39;t influence the color in an IFC export.

My colleague created gridlines just slightly rotated.<br/>
The OIP says the rotations are 0.0000000° or 90.000000°<br/>
They are in fact rotated very slightly. Because if this, they do not show up in elevation or section viewports<br/>
If you use the rotate tool to correct the gridline rotation, they will show up in elevations and sections however, in the OIP the gridline will now mistakenly be shown to be rotated.<br/>
<br/>
Gridlines should correctly show their rotation value in the OIP.

On Edit Material dialog, the &quot;Reference ID&quot; field seems slightly too small, with the kerned space at the right missing compared to the kerned space at the left. Perhaps some values don&#39;t quite fit, or with eastern fonts with slightly different aspect ratio.<br/>
<br/>
On Classification Lookup dialog, the ID field is definitely too small. Pr_20_29_03_05 does not fit, but Pr_20_29_03_10 does because of the narrower &quot;1&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
In both cases, there is plenty of unused space to the right to expand the field.

                Windows: View bar font menu clips font name descender characters

<br/>
The new font menu combo in the view bar shows the active font name in the system font.<br/>
<br/>
However, the size of the control is not sufficient to display font names without clipping if they have descenders (characters like y or g with parts that hang below the baseline).<br/>
<br/>
See attached screenshot - the lowercase &#39;g&#39; in Georgia is clipped. This happens with any font that has these characters in the font name.<br/>
<br/>
The fix is to adjust the size/position/clipping of the control, and/or the size of the font-name text display, to avoid this clipping.

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1) Open the VW document and run the ScriptBug script from the resource manager<br/>
<br/>
(this should be the code of the script <br/>
<br/>
vs.DoMenuTextByName(&quot;RevitImport&quot;, 0)<br/>
vs.DoMenuTextByName(&quot;Save&quot;, 0)<br/>
<br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
2) Import the Table.rfa file as a solid object (The rendering will appear normal)<br/>
<br/>
3) Close the document *without saving it* <br/>
<br/>
4) Open the document again<br/>
<br/>
Now the object will be rendered as a 3D polygon despite the fact it is a Solid object.<br/>
<br/>
Doing the same using the menu commands and not the script does not break the rendering.  <br/>

Note that, in the legend&#39;s attribute swatches, one of the lines is missing in each Hatch fill (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
This line is also missing in exported images and PDFs.<br/>
<br/>
The same Hatch lines show fine in Viewports of the same scale, so this looks like a Graphic Legend issue.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2023.

<br/>
To reproduce, expand the utility menu in the Tool Sets palette and choose View Tool Sets As/Icons and Text.<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Tools section of the palette is inaccessible, as long as the palettes remain docked in their default state.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows it looks like one small area of the Tools section will always remain visible, so this isn&#39;t as much of an issue there (but still pretty awkward).<br/>
<br/>
With all the icons we&#39;ve changed in this version, users are very likely to set their tool sets to show text along with the icons, so this is probably an easy situation to get into.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like the new combined Basic/Tool Sets palette might benefit from some kind of combined scroll bar, where the bottom of the Tool Sets section could scroll out-of-view to make room for a larger Tools section at the top.

As you can see from the enclosed movie if I click the &#39;Open&#39; button from the Home Screen and navigate the Finder I find I have to click on items 2 or 3 times, and generally it is slow and unresponsive. It is as if there is a background process going on slowing everything down.<br/>
This is dangerous as it can result in files being inadvertently moved etc. If I navigate the Finder from the File&gt;Open menu command it is as expected, this problem only happens when via the Home Screen.<br/>
<br/>
I always rename my user folder when installing new builds and I only did this a few days ago with this build. This slowness and unresponsiveness has been happening for some time prior to this build though.<br/>

On my Mac, after the device builder dialog opens it only take one click in each option to start selecting from the pull downs.

<br/>
We have a very weird issue with a workspace and i was wondering if its possible to fix it from our side for this user. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When the workspace is loaded all of the palettes seems to be duplicated and the duplicated palettes seems to be stuck. Its impossible to close them or do anything with them. Is it possible to fix this problem as this workspace is quite unique and would be complicated to recreate. <br/>
<br/>
User would need 2023 workspace to be adjusted. 2022 are just backups.

Take a look at the screen shots. The Building Shell toolbar is three wide (as are all the others) while the basic tool set only allows two tools for the same width. This makes picking the ideal width annoying.

Since upgrading to VW2023 I have had two problems: 1. &#39;Switch Navigation&#39; no longer works. Instead it performs &#39;Fit View&#39;. Being able to use Switch Navigation is ESSENTIAL to using my SpaceMouse as it allows me to set the navigation to &#39;Target Camera Mode&#39;. This is the only mode I can usefully use the SpaceMouse with + not being able to set it to this mode effectively means since VW2023 I have been unable to navigate with my SpaceMouse. 2. &#39;Fit View&#39; no longer works. Instead it performs &#39;Top View&#39;. I spoke to 3DC + they suggested I upgraded to the most recent driver but when I did this things were considerably worse with multiple additional things not working to + so I went back to 10.7.0 where I remain. I can use the devices for the remaining shortcuts without issue. 3DC seemed to suggest that the problem was with VW but without access to a 2023 license they were unable to investigate it fully to determine why it was happening. The last communication I had with them was in March when they said they were still struggling to acquire a 2023 license from you. I have posted about this several times on the Forums, tagging Luis M. Ruiz, but haven&#39;t had any response from VW so decided to submit a bug. The 3DC SpaceMouse is heavily endorsed/promoted by VW + I have certainly found it a very important part of my workflow so to have it become virtually redundant since VW2023 is a massive blow + I would really appreciate your attention.

<br/>
In the two movies you can see a Schematic View being dimensioned in the Annotation group of a viewport. If the dimension is nudged, any associated object will also be nudged. It is common the nudge dimensions in viewport annotations especially for crowded lighting positions like booms.<br/>
<br/>
There is no requirement for dimensions to be associated with the geometry because the dimensions might not be associated with all the parts of the rigging and thus only some parts will be moved.  In any case you can not enter the dimension number like you can with walls, as the rigging geometry is fixed. Vectorworks file enclosed as well.<br/>

When launching VW29.0.0 Mainline on my MacOS 12.6 M1 iMac, there is this message I have never seen before on Windows or VW28 builds on MacOS:<br/>
<br/>
_*Vectorworks2024 wants to use your confidential information stored in &quot;Chromium Safe Storage&quot; in your keychain.*_<br/>
<br/>
Selecting &quot;Deny&quot; will usually bypass this.  However, I have had a few cases where Vectorworks will not launch after Deny, and then I need to re-launch VW29.0.0.  This is most common with User Sign In at First Launch, though I was not able to reproduce for the video attached.<br/>
<br/>
Since I primarily test on Windows, I checked with other QA members, and too have seen this on their Mac machines on a regular bases in VW29.0.0.

In Vectorworks Help &gt; [Application Window|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Start/Application_window.htm?rhhlterm=application%20applicable%20window%20windows&amp;rhsearch=Application%20window] &gt; in table under the Rulers heading…{_}&quot;The 0,0 point on the rulers represents the location of the user origin, or of the working plane axes when using a working plane. The{_} *_User Origin_* _command moves the user origin relative to the internal origin, or moves the working plane origin to that of the layer (see_ {_}[Setting the user origin|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Setup/Setting_the_user_origin.htm#h]{_}{_}).&quot;{_}<br/>
 <br/>
The not-so-short answer seams to be, whether a working plane is invoked or not, when in Top/Plan the rulers always show the user origin, nothing else. I think it has always been thus ([~pneufeld] checked back to 2017), except that Vectorworks help seems to say otherwise.<br/>
 <br/>
In my experience Working Plane rulers have never properly displayed the correct origin location. Anyone know of what I might be doing wrong?

Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Enable Snap To Tangent at the bottom right of the Vectorworks application window.<br/>
2) Draw a circle object (Oval/Circle/Arc).<br/>
3) Select the Line tool, after clicking the center point &quot;A&quot; of the drawn circle object, move the mouse cursor to the position &quot;B&quot; that is parallel to the X axis and away from the circle and click to draw the Line object.<br/>
4) Furthermore, after clicking at position &quot;B&quot;, if the mouse cursor is moved over the circumference of the circle object, the tangent snap will not work.<br/>

<br/>
Initial investigation showed the issue appears to come from how we store WorkingFileData. When an object is added, it also has an ObjectStatus added to keep track of which objects the user has reserved. This gets automatically saved to the working file. When we close without saving, the object no longer exists but the ObjectStatus does. Thus when the file is opened, it has an ObjectStatus of an object that cannot be found, resulting in the &lt;deleted&gt; name.

Customer message:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When exporting/ publishing a view plan, a graphic error is displayed when opening the PDF.<br/>
After I had created one of the image fills as a solid surface using the viewports, the PDF could be created and opened. However, the light gray windows were now displayed much darker gray than in another (correctly exported) view PDF.<br/>
In the next step, I exchanged the affected areas with picture filling for the objects with picture filling on the other view sheet. Even then, the PDF could be created and opened. However, the display of the windows remained incorrect in this case as well.<br/>
In the next step I then copied the window symbols of the working view and replaced them in the faulty view. Unfortunately, this did not improve the display.<br/>
The same problem occurred on a completely different PC. I have attached the VWX file and the 3 different PDFs of the views.&quot;

If you move the curve while in a Left or Right view, the problem won&#39;t happen.<br/>

If you go to Top/Plan view and then return to Front/Back view, the problem will fix itself temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
If you resize the curve in its bad state, the problem will fix itself permanently.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions. This also happens in VW 2024.

This seems like a refresh kind of issue where, for some reason, the text being displayed in the bubble for the view pane is &quot;a frame behind&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
Because this can be triggered in a new blank document, I did not post a VWX. If you would like a screen recording, just let me know.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Click in the view bar font menu title area (don&#39;t show the menu, just click in the font title)<br/>
 # Note the title of the current font becomes selected<br/>
 # Type the string &quot;notafont&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: typing either does not do anything, or it opens the font menu to select a font that matches (and selects no font if there is no match)<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the string &quot;Notafont&quot; replaces the currently applied font name. If you hit enter, this string stays in the control until you do something that forces a change like select a different text object.<br/>
<br/>
VARIATION: this also happens if instead of clicking on the font drop-down title you click to show the menu, and then type a string that does not match any font.

<br/>
Note that the bounding area for the cells is including all of the text from the Field Definition, even though that text isn&#39;t actually visible. If you place the cursor over the cell, you can snap to the outline of the text object.<br/>

This causes a large empty area to show at the bottom of each cell.<br/>

 I have a customer who has seen their sheet dimension change when exporting a DWG with the viewport at 1:25 scale. When exporting 1:50 It exports correctly - do you know what might be causing this? <br/>

They are on VW2021 but I tested it in VW2023 and it&#39;s the same issue. <br/>

They would like to export at 1:25 <br/>

This is only on Windows Installer, I am not seeing this issue on MacOS.<br/>
<br/>
A video has been included.  Not that if the Read Me document is the first to be downloaded, it will have this issue.  I seems to just be the first document, doesn&#39;t matter if it is the License Agreement of the Read Me.<br/>
<br/>
Might be hard to notice in the video, but it seems like clicking buttons while in the Not Responding state will load that action once the installer comes back.  I have seen the installer skip ahead a few pages or back because I pressed Next or Back.

Then assign some object to that class and try the process again – now it works as expected.

                T02059 - Equipment List&gt;Edit Selected - Performance difference in Shaded vs. Top Plan or Wireframe

<br/>
The video is demonstrating the time difference using Edit Selected in Shaded vs. Top Plan (or Wireframe)<br/>
 * In Shaded, it takes 35 seconds for the Properties window to show after clicking Edit Selected<br/>
 * In Top Plane, it takes 6 seconds for the Properties window to show after clicking Edit Selected<br/>
<br/>
When using a Tool like Find and Modify to select the same set of Lighting Devices, it takes less than 10 seconds for both Shaded &amp; Tope Plan.  There isn&#39;t much of a difference.<br/>
<br/>
This might be a limitation or working the best it can, just wanted to point it to help with faster workflow if possible.

<br/>
The video example just shows the truss, but with other layers open it becomes very unmanageable. This was drawn originally in VW 23 and, although it occasionally seemed to lag, it is way more noticeable in this build.<br/>
<br/>
Also noted is an issue with the truss snapping, trying to move an existing box truss leg out, reform and then back in causes feet to act strangely, then trying to reattach them causes the issue with the footplate spinning upside down. I can post this as another report if I&#39;m not being stupid?<br/>

<br/>
this file is incredible slow when inserting or moving truss pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Inserting a truss can take up to 2.5 Minutes.<br/>
On my machine, only seeing the trusses and the Lighting Devices, it takes about 25 seconds. Still too long.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to have dependencies to the Lighting Devices in this drawing.<br/>
When removing them, it takes way less time to insert, moving or connecting trusses.<br/>
<br/>
When copying all trusses into a new file, the same steps only take about .2 - .5 Seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please take a look what the bottleneck is causing?<br/>
Maybe you can provide another way to handle this file.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and have a good one.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards<br/>
Alex

To reproduce, update the SVP.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the update takes over a minute to complete.<br/>
<br/>
If you remove the Draped Hardscape, the SVP updates in less than a second.<br/>
<br/>
If the Hardscape is Ungrouped into Mesh objects, the slowdown still happens in both VW 2022 and 2023, so this is probably not related to the T02353 (Draped Hardscape) task.<br/>
<br/>
If the Meshes are converted to Subdivisions the problem then goes away, so this seems like a Mesh issue.

&quot;The loading bar will pause on “Step 6” for anywhere from 30 seconds to almost 2 minutes before continuing to load and finally open our file.

<br/>
Using 3ds backing shows the same results, so not a cause of glTF from what I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
I have included videos showing the Export MVR (both glTF &amp; 3ds backing) with the Memory graph for my Windows 10 machine with 32GB.  Tested and seen on my MacOS M1 16GB machine as well.<br/>
<br/>
Another concerning note (which is seen in the videos) is that once the Export to MVR is completed, the Memory doesn&#39;t drop until I close the file.  I am not sure if this is expected, but looks like an unwanted behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need more testing or info.

                                            <td class="description">      I&#39;ve been trying to &quot;stress-test&quot; many different types of objects and profiling them (using VS2022). Hardscape is just one of the object types that have {{TFormatBaseImpl::GetFieldIndex}} and {{GS_FindAuxObject}} in their profiles. I saw them in many performance bugs in the past. This time I kind of dug deep into it, trying to see if those functions are really the culprit of the slowness. I profiled 3 different cases, and their hot paths all point to {{TFormatBaseImpl::GetFieldIndex}} and {{{}GS_FindAuxObject{}}}:<br/>
 * Delete 16k hardscapes - it took 36&#39; to finish<br/>
 * Copy and Paste 8k hardscapes - it took &gt;50&#39; and still not done; I had to force quit it<br/>
 * Move 16k hardscapes - it took &gt;35&#39; and still not done; I had to force quit it<br/>
<br/>
Since they all have similar hot paths and flame graphs, I upload only the last one&#39;s here. I wrote a test that measures the time the 2 aforementioned functions take to finish with the same .vwx file that contains 16k hardscapes, and it took only 128.75 milliseconds (please see {_}test_for_the_2_functions_mentioned_above.png{_}). I&#39;m not sure if my test is 100% correct/accurate, but if it&#39;s correct, then maybe the improvement that we need to make is in the plug-in code? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just trying to provide as much data as possible here. For more info:<br/>
 * {{GS_FindAuxObject}} is called by the bold part of: {*}VWParametricObj(hObject){*}.GetParamBool(&quot;A test string&quot;);<br/>
 * {{TFormatBaseImpl::GetFieldIndex}} is called by the bold part of: VWParametricObj(hObject){*}.GetParamBool(&quot;A test string&quot;){*};

                3D walkthrough tool performance very inconsistent between files
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I am trying to use the 3D walk-through tool in gamer mode. I want it to work so badly!<br/>
<br/>
But in certain large files, the mouse response when looking around is just really rough. It is choppy and inconsistent, making it almost unusable and certainly embarrassing to use in front of anyone else. I dragging my mouse and even though the pointer disappears, I feel like I can tell when it gets to the edge of the display and then its ability to keep changing the camera slows way down and I have to swipe and swipe and swipe to try to get any noticeable camera movement. <br/>
<br/>
On a 2-screen setup, it is much much worse and almost every time I try to use this mode, I get stuck in a situation where my VW camera view is just spinning wildly out of control. Like the mouse moves to the other display and messes up all the math VW is using.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure how to capture or reproduce this.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached 3 files:<br/>
<br/>
Open the one called `Gamer Mode View Ref.vwx`. It is a file full of 3D scenery. Looking around using walkthrough game mode works really well. It is smooth and responsive. Great!<br/>
<br/>
Then open `Gamer Mode view Big File.vwx`. It has a lot more going on in the file (positions, lights, lots more 2D stuff. A full light plot. It has a reference to the 3D scenery from the file above in a design layer viewport on the `3D - Scenery` layer. If you go to the 30-3D Walkthrough, and activate the Walkthrough tool in gamer mode and try looking around, you&#39;ll find performance is maybe half as good as the other file, but still usable and not too embarrassing. <br/>
<br/>
Then set `3D - Scenery` as the active layer and switch to Active Only mode. Performance speeds right back up to be comparable to the original file, which makes sense since the only stuff I&#39;m not seeing in this view is the same stuff as the original file, referenced in. <br/>
<br/>
Then open `HLL Bway Light Plot RevB2a.vwx`. It should be the EXACT SAME file as the `Gamer Mode view Big File.vwx`. I made `Gamer Mode view Big File.vwx` by doing &quot;Save a copy as&quot; from `HLL Bway Light Plot RevB2a.vwx`. But performance is totally different. When you go to that saved view, it is basically unusable. And even when you go to Active Only mode on `3D - Scenery`, it remains almost just as slow and laggy. <br/>
<br/>
How are these files different? Why is their performance so different?<br/>
<br/>
I have had these issues for several versions now, at least.

                Hardscape Realignment is Very Slow When Using Higher 3D Conversion Resolution

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- In the VW Prefs, change the 3D Conversion Resolution to &quot;Very High&quot;<br/>
- Now reset the Hardscape in any way<br/>
<br/>
Note that the spinning beach ball appears for over 10 minutes before the operation finally completes.<br/>
<br/>
If the 3D Conversion Resolution is set to &quot;High&quot; the operation will take about 40 seconds, and if it&#39;s set to &quot;Medium&quot; it&#39;ll take about 15 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I might be wrong, but it seems like the calculations that are done to figure out the alignment would be based on the Simplification Tolerance of the Hardscapes, while the conversion resolution shouldn&#39;t have much of an impact. In cases like this, users are unlikely to wait for 10 minutes and will probably assume that VW is frozen.

I log this as medium because performance has always a high priority. But honestly I have to say that the symbol is cool but pretty complex. Therefore it might be an exotic issue but anyhow worth to analyze.

When adjusting the &quot;Pleat Width&quot; of a Soft Good to a value under 5&quot; there is a substantial freeze in VW. No rainbow pinwheel appears, VW just looses functionality until the Soft Good is re-rendered. This occurs in iso views, top/plan view and in wireframe/shaded modes.<br/>
<br/>
Unsure if there is much to be done about this, but potentially adding a progress indicator in the status bar might prevent the user from thinking they need to Force Quit.<br/>

<br/>
To test this, I have gone through creating a model of 4 walls with windows and a door, and also included one staircase. Then copied it 20 times. making a total of 100 objects. <br/>
<br/>
Then copied these 100 objects 2 times, converted one of these bunch into a Symbol, and Grouped the other one. <br/>
<br/>
Please see the videos attached. <br/>
<br/>
In video 1, I made a copy of those 100 objects, a copy of the symbol, and a copy of the group using the holding option key. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of time, copying:<br/>
<br/>
- the 100 objects took about 9 sec<br/>
- the symbol took less than 1 sec<br/>
- the group took about 9 sec<br/>
<br/>
In video 2, I made the same experiment but using the rotation tool:<br/>
<br/>
In terms of time, rotating:<br/>
<br/>
- the 100 objects took about 16 sec<br/>
- the symbol took less than 1 sec<br/>
- the group took about 16 sec<br/>
<br/>
In video 3, I made the same experiment but trim a line along those objects using the trim tool.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of time, trimming:<br/>
<br/>
- the 100 objects less than 1 sec<br/>
- the symbol took about 8 sec<br/>

-Notice there is a long delay and it seems there are calculations being done in the background. The is a &quot;Destroy List&quot; progress bar, and that could be what is causing the delay?<br/>

                Wall closure: geometry output is incorrect for negative values

<br/>
Please check attached screenshots and Vectorworks file.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to create extra space above the window frame on the interior side. <br/>
The settings in the wall closure dialog predict the desired result. But the geometry in the drawing doesn&#39;t correspond to those settings: the window frame sticks to the top of the interior opening, while it&#39;s expected to have a space of (in this case) 12 cm between the interior wall geometry and the top of the frame.<br/>
<br/>
I have the impression it&#39;s related to the use of negative values. Could it be they are not converted correctly to the wall geometry?

The Design Suite workspace is amazing! However it is missing three important Landmark *contextual* commands. They are:<br/>
<br/>
* Create Plant Style from Selection...<br/>
* Open Plant Data<br/>
* Choose Plant Data Source.<br/>
<br/>
Although available like most commands as a menu item having them in the contextual menu if very efficient, especially for the first one when making plant styles from selected graphics. Screenshot enclosed.<br/>

<br/>
The documentation for the BuildResourceList and BuildResourceList2 contain a list of FolderIndex numbers.<br/>
<br/>
The list in the Documentation on the Dev Site is much longer than the one in the installed version of the docs.<br/>
<br/>
I have not compared the lists to see if there are items missing from the Dev Site version.<br/>
<br/>
The version of the list on the Dev Site should be checked for completeness and then that list should be used for both versions of the docs. A system should be put in place so that future changes to the list automatically get included in both versions of the docs.

The app is looking for VWX files by their English name. Can&#39;t the names of these files be translated? I found these two vwstrings files inside the plug-in:<br/>
 * 12005 PlantNames DO NOT LOCALIZE.vwstrings<br/>
 * 12006 PlantNames LOCALIZE.vwstrings<br/>
<br/>
It might be using the first, though I think it should use the second. IMO the filenames should be localizable.

<br/>
1) We change following object properties:<br/>
- kObjXPropPreserveContents is set to true<br/>
- kObjectSpecialEditPropertyID is set to kObjXPropSpecialEditEditGroup<br/>
<br/>
2) our PIOs that work as a group contain a single group handle (with sub PIOs inside this group)<br/>
<br/>
3) whenever the user enters the group edit mode, we simply take the group from point 2 and set it as profile handle =&gt; this removes the group from the parent, sets it as profile handle and this allows us to make the &quot;content&quot; of the PIO visible inside the group edit mode<br/>
<br/>
4) whenever the user leaves the group edit mode, we create a new empty group below the parent PIO, then we move everything from the profile handle to this new group and then we delete the profile handle again =&gt; this way, everything below the group PIO is visible outside of the group edit mode again.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
This way we get a full group like behaviour but can also make our groups full PIOs with their own parameters, rules and logic.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
*We see following problem:*<br/>
<br/>
When we are inside our group PIO we can place new plugin objects as well as &quot;native&quot; objects like e.g. lines... The problem is, that we see a weird behaviour here. The group PIO gets regenerated whenever we place a new plugin object inside it (via kObjectExternalReset), whenever we change a plugin object inside it, add a new plugin object inside it and similar. But as soon as we place a &quot;native&quot; object like e.g. a line inside the group PIO the group PIO stops getting regenerated on every change inside it, even if we repeat changes that did regenerate the group PIO before we placed a line inside it... this is inconsistent and we wonder why this is like this and if this behaviour could be corrected to some consistent behaviour instead... As we do like to make live corrections inside out group PIO (as the user can freely place objects inside the group PIO it would be nice to correct some things here instantly) we would prefer that the group PIO gets regenerated on every change inside it - but currently this is not reliable...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Bottom note:*<br/>
<br/>
If there is a better way to use PIOs inside PIOs, especially without misusing data changes like we do currently for this purpose, we would be interested as well...

He then used the texture tool to give one face of the extrude a different texture (example being wood flooring). After he copied and pasted the extruded object into a new location on the design layer, the texture face reverted to the original overall texture. The same occurs when duplicating the extruded object.<br/>

This was tested in a blank document on the users end on on Tech Supports end.<br/>

1. If we open the VW-Document with 28.0.7, the Space object selected when opening the file is correctly displayed.<br/>
<br/>
2. If we open the VW-Document with 28.0.7, save it and then open with 29.0.1 the same space object is also correctly displayed.<br/>
<br/>
3. If we open the VW-Document directly with 29.0.1, the Space object is not correctly displayed anymore.<br/>

That brings the thought that is something wrong with the Space object when converting the file from 27.x.x to 29.x.x.

<br/>
When I started up and opened a project today I immediately checked the cardinal views (using the keypad shortcuts) and they were showing in narrow perspective instead of orthogonal. And I explicitly remember last night checking if the cardinal views were in orthogonal before I shut down.<br/>
<br/>
I knew this would happen. It&#39;s probably going to be very difficult to reproduce. And it&#39;s probably going to be an ongoing problem into future versions. Which is why I would have preferred explicit settings rather than relying on VW to remember last choices.

                VW recalculates unedited styled objectes like they were edited

</td>

<br/>
User chooses &quot;edit style&quot; from OIP on styled object inserted into the wall (e.g. Design Express WinDoor tool). Then presses CANCEL button - let&#39;s say a wrong window was selected. VW recalculates all instances in the same way like in a scenario when User presses OK button, but without any changes.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t the CANCEL button just end the operation, without updating all instances?<br/>
<br/>
I did a test and compared recalculating/updating time in each case. 8 styled windows, inserted into the wall. Each time I reopened VW in the same conditions.<br/>
 # Pressed OK without changes - 01:38<br/>
 # Pressed CANCEL - 01:38<br/>
 # Pressed OK, after changes in dimensions - 01:39<br/>
<br/>
As you can see the time needed to update model for all 3 cases is the same, but only the last one makes any difference in geometry. It is a problem regarding seeing VW as a slow software.<br/>

A good case in point would be Truss objects which always have their insertion points at the Left or the Right of the object in the drawing area. It is often useful to be able to automatically apply a Data Tag to the Centre of the object instead.<br/>

One of them is a visibility of functions - the length/angle/etc in a pop-up menu when drawing a line using the Line Tool. On Mac, there is no need to press a Tab key to display the length/etc. but it&#39;s rather been used for the activation of the fields to edit them (Screenshots attached). On Windows, there seems to be a need to press a Tab key in order to see the existing dimensions and there is no further chance to activate the edit options.

<br/>
Web service as WMS with this URL ([https://data.wien.gv.at/daten/geo?version=1.3.0&amp;service=WMS&amp;request=GetCapabilities]) does not work.<br/>
Original URL can be found here ([https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/e8b9bb31-5ad1-4cc3-a0ae-177c93671d0b#resources])<br/>
Last week the WMS web service worked and now it no longer works. Apparently the services have been changed in Austria.<br/>
Is there any additional functionality missing in Vectorworks to edit such a URL?<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>

<br/>
When creating an Inventory, VW app (FR) should create an XML within the User Folder Bibliothèque\Ressources\Inventaires to manage stocks from this inventory to be used by different projects.<br/>
If we want to change stock amount we have an option to Update the inventory even if it is not present in the current file. To do this VW app write the changes to the XML file.<br/>
<br/>
In VW2024 Update 1 T2, There is now way to update the inventories. Each time I click on the Update Inventory VW does not find the XML and rebuilds a new default one wiping all the previous changes.<br/>
I checked in the User FolderBibliothèque\Ressources\Inventaires folder (where it should stand) and there is no XML file here. so I guess VW writes the xml file in a wrong location.<br/>
<br/>
I checked in the US version and I can find the XML files for all my inventories at the right place (User Folder Libraries\Defaults\Inventories)<br/>
<br/>
Note from Nele: I think this is a localization issue but I don&#39;t know where to look for. At my PC I don&#39;t have this problem but 2 collegaes do have this problem. So it seems important enough to solve this in our SP1. I need the solution as soon as possible. Could you help me?<br/>

I&#39;ll include the needed localized vwr&#39;s

I have an Equipment Item (not using a symbol) that displays as expected in T/P, but then flattens to a single line when linked to a drop point.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Notice the red line now drawn towards the left side of the object. Could this be the symbolic spline link but drawn on the wrong plane? <br/>
<br/>
Still looks OK in 3D though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe this is because the Equipment Item has been rotated from the orientation it was generated in. It was generated upright, and when linked to a drop point, it functions fine, as below. But the rotated version of it doesn&#39;t. In this particular case, the params of this desk need swapping so it lays flat by default. But not everything has a default orientation.<br/>

                Vectorworks 2023 Shared Project, disappearing objects after Save/Commit

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      From _Tech Support_ (I will refer to us as {_}TS{_}): The user confirmed all who were working on the file are all working on vwx 2023. Title block does not stay the way that it should: in the &quot;date&quot; section, the date will be changed, saved, and we close the program, reopen the program and the change will stay for a little bit of time but will ultimately revert back to the old date from before the change. When TS opened the file, the file was already labeled as CD and not EX as the customer is experiencing. The viewports needed updating so the missing details would show, TS updated and saved the file, closed the program, reopened the program. The updates remained in the viewports for a bit of time before ultimately reverting back to before they were updated. I had the customer try turning on Viewport cache to retain data from the viewports but this did not help with the issue. What I ended up trying for the Annotations issue was clicking on the individual viewports one at a time, selecting Annotations, highlight over all of the text objects that I want to remove the fill from, going to the Attributes Palette and making sure fill is set to None. I saved and exited the program, reopened and the text had not re-filled again, until later.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
From the User: There is a line across the screen that appears on sheet A-6.0, in the viewports 1b and 1c. In 1b a large countertop appears in the viewport, which is not there. I have no idea what this even is (it isn’t in the design or annotations). In the viewport 1c the opposite is happening… the countertop is not showing. Even though it is there in the design layer when you go into it. In the left hand viewport there is a countertop running the entire way across the viewport. This isn’t even in the model (if you go into the design layer or the elevation in place). In the right hand viewport the countertop is not showing at all. It’s on the same class as the cabinets. And again, when you go into the model the countertop is there and shown correctly, just not in the viewport. <br/>
On top of that, I have had issues with the windows not actually being in the walls on the elevations, like the siding goes right through them even though they are called out as a “window in wall.” The windows in wall, on the exterior elevation, you can still see the siding, the window is not creating a hole in the wall.<br/>
The title block keeps reverting back to an old date and showing the project in “EX” instead of “CD.” Every time I open the file the title block has reverted to say “EX.’<br/>
One more problem is that the elevation grades on the sheet A-4.0 keep reverting to an older setting. In these elevation markers I do not want the text to have any fill, so they are easier to read. I have probably changed these at least a dozen times throughout drawing this project and like the title block they just keep reverting. <br/>
<br/>
Now that I’ve tried it a few times, the box “Save Viewport Cache” in the document preferences won’t even stay checked even when I save and close the file and reopen it. So that is reverting as well.<br/>
<br/>

The user additionally sent over this forum link mentioning it is a similar issue to his issue with the window in wall. https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/101836-window-door-in-wall-issue/

                Creating a Sketch Style Folder also creates the &quot;Rough&quot; sketch style
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This only happens the first time a Sketch Style folder is created in a file. No other resource type creates a resource when its folder is created. Regardless of whether the new folder is created manually, by using UI buttons in the Resource Manager, or by running a script to create Sketch Style Folder, the &quot;Rough&quot; sketch style gets created with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1) Open a new blank file.<br/>
<br/>
2) Open the Resource Manager (RM).<br/>
<br/>
3) Click on the New Folder... button at the bottom left of the RM.<br/>
<br/>
4) Select &quot;Sketch Style Folder&quot; from the popup menu in the New Folder dialog, and click OK.<br/>
<br/>
5) The Sketch Style Folder is created, and the sketch style resource &quot;Rough&quot; is also created.<br/>
<br/>
6) No other folder type, when selected in the New fFolder dialog popup, will create a resource in addition to creating the requested folder.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem also exists if a Sketch Style Folder is created by script. The &quot;Rough&quot; sketch style also gets created.<br/>
<br/>
If the &quot;Rough&quot; sketch style is deleted, creating another Sketch Style Folder DOES NOT create the &quot;Rough&quot; sketch style again. &quot;Rough&quot; only gets created the first time a Sketch Style Folder is created.

3) Open the &quot;Artistic Renderworks Options&quot; dialog and switch the style to &quot;Hatch&quot;.<br/>
4) Create a new saved view with all options enabled.<br/>
5) Switch the render mode to &quot;Render Style White Model&quot;<br/>
6) Click the View &gt; &quot;Set Renderworks Background...&quot; menu command.<br/>
7) Switch the type to &quot;Artistic&quot;.<br/>
8) In the &quot;Artistic Style&quot; pane, switch the style to &quot;Art&quot; and click the OK button to close the dialog.<br/>
9) Attempt to activate the saved view.<br/>
<br/>
The extrude on the drawing doesn&#39;t render as expected.  I expect that the extrude would render with Artistic Renderworks with the Hatch style.  The &quot;Current Render Mode&quot; in the View bar still says &quot;Render Style White Model&quot;.  If I change to Shaded, Wireframe, or other render modes, activating the saved view works as expected.<br/>

For VW2025 we want to unwind that and use the more proper:<br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;license-type&quot;: &quot;evaluation&quot;{color}<br/>
LDF field to determine is a license is a trial license.  <br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks will have to change to allow <br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;license-type&quot;: &quot;evaluation&quot;{color}<br/>
to be specified with the serial number LDF field like:<br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;serial-number&quot;: &quot;EKXUSN-RZBKFF-XXXXXX-G1BL03&quot;,{color}<br/>
rather than the eval-token LDF field that it currently requires like:<br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;eval-token&quot;: &quot;VWEval-29-0000-0000-0000&quot;{color}<br/>

Note the eval-token approach should still be supported for VW2025. We just want the serial number approach to be supported also. <br/>

----------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Addendum:<br/>
<br/>
The terms &quot;eval&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; are obsolete. The new term we want to use everywhere we can is &quot;trial&quot;. I know the SDK has some calls that use the terms eval/evaluation, and I don&#39;t think we need to change those. But it would be good if we could change the LDF license-type value from:<br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;license-type&quot;: &quot;evaluation&quot;{color}<br/>
to<br/>
{color:#de350b}&quot;license-type&quot;: &quot;trial&quot;{color}<br/>

                Railing not reset after post symbol is replaced in the resource manager

 # Locate the post symbol in the resource manager<br/>
 # Delete it and replace it with another symbol<br/>
The railing still appears to use the old post profile symbol. Resetting the railing fixes the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The railing object stores a reference to the post symbol in a symdef parameter in its parametric record. When it&#39;s a 2D profile it&#39;s used as an extrusion profile, and when it&#39;s a hybrid symbol, it gets inserted (and maybe scaled).<br/>
<br/>
The issue is that the parameter gets updated, but the railing object doesn&#39;t get reset after that.

In 2023 SP6 I placed the default Laubwerk Plant (LP). The only thing I changed in the LW Global Settings in the OIP was the &#39;3D representation&#39; to &#39;High Detail&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
1. In the movies (no sound) you can see when I go to the Top the rendering disappears as if there&#39;s an Internal Origin issue. If I duplicate or just Modify&gt;&#39;Convert to Group&#39; to get a Mesh, it and the existing LP then both render correctly when using the flyover tool!<br/>
See movie Laub 1.<br/>
<br/>
2. Undocumented. Eventually after some flying around the 3D part completely disappeared. I could use a selection marquee to select it. So far I haven&#39;t repeated.<br/>
3. Sometimes the colour goes and I get a white colour.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. In 2024, similar to above:<br/>
I placed the default Laubwerk Plant (LP). The only thing I changed in the LW Global Settings in the OIP was the &#39;3D representation&#39; to &#39;High Detail&#39;. Material Style was set to colour but it was as if it was set to None. See Laub 2 movie.<br/>
<br/>
4. In the Movie Laub 3 you can see that when the LP is viewed from above it basically disappears. You will also see that when I change the variant the program crashes. This has happened twice.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

Unfortunately I have no longer the possibility to bulk edit distances of arrow connections and align them at least on one side (e.g. -24 or -32 to stay in our 4x4mm grid). But that might be a future feature request.<br/>
<br/>
But at least I would like to move the vertex points together when selected as I would for other circuits. This is currently not possible, as the vertex point positions change in Edit mode (see attached video).

                TK BUG: Import DXF/DWG: Layerfilter: Classes are created although they are excluded in the Layer-Filter

                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
at the moment I produce a Webinar for Computerworks Germany.<br/>
Topic will be: Import/Export with DXF/DWG 2024.<br/>
<br/>
And I found some various bugs with DXF/DWG, some bugs have already<br/>
been reported. I am not sure if this error was reported yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BUG:<br/>
I do not want to import some layers and objects,<br/>
for this I have set various filters (see video).<br/>
<br/>
The objects on the excluded layers are not imported,<br/>
but the classes for them will be created.<br/>
<br/>
But the classes are not always created, sometimes yes, sometimes no.<br/>
I can&#39;t really replicate it, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
This erroneous behavior occurs only in combination of layer AND object filter.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is more cosmetic, but should definitely be fixed. <br/>
Because the user has otherwise, the feeling that it is somehow faulty.<br/>
<br/>
Wish:<br/>
Please never create classes that are excluded in the layer filter!<br/>
<br/>
Many greetings from Germany<br/>
Tobi<br/>

If a designer is making such a schedule, and if they are including plants not intended for the schedule (i.e. existing plants - especially if they are not using the existing tree tool), then it should not be brought into PlantMaster as if it is part of the proposed plant schedule.<br/>
<br/>
The attached images represent the selected plants (Red Maple) which have their &quot;On Plant List&quot; disabled, and the worksheet produced does not include the Acer Rubrum (Red Maple, yet the image of the imported plant report for PlantMaster does include the Red Maple not intended to be included.<br/>

From a recent conversation where Katarina mentioned this would go away, this could be a lower priority to solve, but will leave this up to the development team to know if it is an easy fix or not.

Of course, when there is only one package in a category, its senseless to have this button present, but I do believe that the button position looks better placed with Mac than with Windows.

Sam Jones has a script that attaches C-Clamps that will appear adequately but shifts the symbol&#39;s attachment point based on the last C-Clamp inserted.

                KLS: WinDoor not working in german version because of EPVSCheck
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
plug-in WinDoor from Install Partner Products is not working in German version any more.<br/>
I strongly assume it is the EPVSCheck inside that VectorScript.<br/>
This function has changed from Vectorworks 2022 to 2023.<br/>
Some of our VectorScripts had the same behavior, so I assume the EPVSCheck.<br/>
As I know, the number of parameters have changed from 6 to 5.<br/>
Please have a look at the code of WinDoor and check if EPVSCheck is correct.<br/>
<br/>
This bug is easy to reproduce. Simply download WinDoor into a German version of Vectorworks using a german serial number. You cannot test it with an us-version, because here it will work.<br/>
So this bug report only affects the german version of Vectorworks. And I assume it affects all versions except the us-version, at least the european versions.<br/>

                KLS: Help text in worksheet function not reacting on settings in Language and Region
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Worksheet Functions do react on settings of number format in Language &amp; Region in OS Settings.<br/>
In Germany we do have colon as decimal separator while in US and Swiss it is a dot.<br/>
This affects the worksheet functions.<br/>
<br/>
For example average function. In US and Swiss it is AVERAGE(a,b,c). You see a colon is used. In German it is AVERAGE(a;b;c). You see a semicolon is used,<br/>
<br/>
In Select Function dialog window the function reacts on the settings in Language &amp; Region. It shows a colon or a semicolon depending on the settings in Language &amp; Region.<br/>
This is great for us, because our german Vectorworks is for Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In Germany and Switzerland we do have different settings in Language &amp; Region. See screenshot Select Function.png.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there is one left, where the function does not react on settings in Language and Region and this is the help text when typing a function.<br/>
See Screenshot Function Help Text.png.<br/>
This help text is static. I can write the functions in those help text either with semicolon or colon. This forces me to always write the function two times. One time in german with semicolon and one time in swiss with colon.<br/>
This is annoying and could confuse the customers. A help text should help and not confuse.<br/>
<br/>
So please make the help text reacting too on settings in Language and Region.<br/>
I created quite a long video to explain my issue.<br/>

I have a customer file which obviously is corrupt. Maybe you can repair that?<br/>
<br/>
Customer was working in 2022 using international version and switched to German Vectorworks in 2023.<br/>
They use templates for their office.<br/>
<br/>
Template works well in 2022 and 2024. But not in 2023.<br/>
See video for the malfunction.<br/>
They reference a viewport and the result is, that objects are missing, text is moved, objects are moved.<br/>
It does only happen to the template. If you create a new document it does not happen.<br/>
So it must be something in their template SPACE4_Vorgabe_2023_deutsch.sta.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can repair it?! I would be fine. <br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Shaded Rendering projects shadows in incorrect positions<br/>
<br/>
If shaded rendering (formerly OpenGL Rendering) is performed with the options &quot;Shadows&quot; and &quot;On ground only&quot; enabled in Shaded Options, shadows will be projected below the ground (Z:0).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Place a simple 3D shape and a light source.<br/>
2) Enable the options &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;On ground only&quot; in the Shaded Options.<br/>
3) Execute Shade Rendering, and the shadow will be projected below the ground (Z:0).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;Sample231012.vwx&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
In v2019 and below, OpenGL rendering with similar settings will project the shadow at a height of Z:0.<br/>
<br/>

                Memory Leak in TaggedDataSet
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I think I&#39;ve found a potential memory leak in TaggedDataSet. For a task I am working on, I needed to store a few MBs of file data from the hard drive in the VW document. I was initially going to use UserDataNodes for this. But, it was suggested that I use TaggedData instead.<br/>
<br/>
So, I started looking for examples in our code. I found this example which I based my code on:<br/>
<br/>
{code:c}<br/>
for (size_t i=0; i &lt; inNumUniChars; i++) {<br/>
  *pDst = inStr.GetAt(i);<br/>
  if ( ! VERIFYN(kEJKerr, gSDK-&gt;TaggedDataSet(inhOwner, inContainerTag, kTaggedDataByteArrayTypeID, inDataTag, dataIndex++, &amp;dst[0])))}}<br/>
    outbSuccess = false;<br/>
  if ( ! VERIFYN(kEJKerr, gSDK-&gt;TaggedDataSet(inhOwner, inContainerTag, kTaggedDataByteArrayTypeID, inDataTag, dataIndex++, &amp;dst[1])))<br/>
    outbSuccess = false;<br/>
}<br/>
{code}<br/>
My test code is writing ~1.7MB of data. So, my for loop is a much bigger one and I am calling TaggedDataSet many times; 1770425 times to be exact. So, my code looks like:<br/>
{code:c}<br/>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; bufferLength; ++i, ++bufferIter)<br/>
	gSDK-&gt;TaggedDataSet(fParentHandle, kDataContainer, kTaggedDataByteArrayTypeID, kRecordingDataTag, i, bufferIter);<br/>
{code}<br/>
When I ran my test code, VW allocated around 130GB of data before MacOS spawned a dialog saying I ran out of memory and needed for force quit an application to free up memory.<br/>
<br/>
I ran this test code again with the MacOS Leaks Instruments tool running to try to narrow things down. I included screenshots and hope they help.

Notice the item is deleted from the list browser in the Lights page but the object is not deleted. If we place a Light object instead, the object can be deleted correctly from the Lights page.<br/>
<br/>
UI events are received and Core code is being called, but the object is not deleted. I tested VW2023 SP7 and it already happened. The problem must be in the Core or the Lighting Device tool.

In the enclosed file and screenshots you can see that the beams of light that appear in the lit fog are quite strong at 1%. <br/>
<br/>
Also, the difference between say 50% and 100% isn&#39;t that great. It seems that in the past there was a linear curve from 1-100 but now it is not so controllable and thus subtleties aren&#39;t possible. <br/>
<br/>
In the file I was trying to just &#39;hint&#39; very slightly a beam but at 1% it&#39;s a bit like a rock concert! It seems the fine control has gone.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

This happens with the wall tool, not only the geometry and metadata has to be able to be read by revit, but it&#39;s also important that Revit can edit it like it does with walls that originated in VW.<br/>
<br/>
DTMs and Hardscapes arrive into Revit as none editable and as a wireframe mesh. DTMs also arrive as generic solids, not as a terrain. Can someone get in touch with me regarding these topics ? we absolutely need these two object to be read correctly in Revit. Thanks, Jorge

3) change into 3D perspective and orbit around the object<br/>
--&gt; the crop rectangle is fixed to the screen plane, and only the content of the crop looks correct. The surrounding part looks buggy.<br/>
4) open the referenced file: &quot;source-file v2024.vwx&quot;<br/>
--&gt; there you will find the same situation as in 3)<br/>
5) open and delete the crop rectangle<br/>
--&gt; now the DLVP looks correct<br/>
6) open &quot;non-ref-DLVP.vwx&quot;<br/>
--&gt; this DLVP is also cropped, but not referenced, yet it looks correct<br/>
<br/>
So, the issue seems to be referenced vs. non-referenced.<br/>

Strangely this issue looks very different for our customer in Vectorworks 2023:<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * Make sure &quot;Undo View Changes: Group similar view changes&quot; is enabled in VW Prefs<br/>
 * Activate the RW Camera<br/>
 * Zoom a few times<br/>
 * Now Undo<br/>
<br/>
Note that each zoom registers as an Undo operation, which can easily eat-up your entire Undo history.<br/>
<br/>
This also happens when editing RW Cameras in camera-linked Viewports.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

Only the cable that was used to access the context menu command &#39;edit profile&#39; will be edited despite having multiple cable route objects selected when running the command.<br/>
<br/>
This is a major hinderence if the user wishes to accurately depect the cable routes in their 3D model, as there is no way to define the profile while drawing, and if the user is adding links to drop points and other object the cable routes rapidly splits into a large number of seprate sections each of which has to be individually edited.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
I use Unreal Engine 5.3.0 and Vectorworks 2024 (same in 2023).<br/>
<br/>
I Created a little scene with some geometry and materials.<br/>
<br/>
I Use the unreal Datasmith direct Link.<br/>
<br/>
After importing, everything looks pretty fine.<br/>
<br/>
In Unreal, I Change the Roughness of a Material, and maybe do some other changes.<br/>
<br/>
When going back to Vectorworks 2024, to maybe add a new object, everything will be transfered to Unreal, what is good, and overwrites the changes I made to my material, what is bad...<br/>
<br/>
My Expectation: When no changes have been made to an object itself, the material of that object should remain with the Unreal Settings.<br/>
<br/>
Would be great: When changing the geometry of an object with material, the material should not overwrite the changes within Unreal.<br/>
<br/>
A Video and a file attached.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you need further details or something is unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and best Regards<br/>
Alex

<br/>
After that, I was unable to reopen the window organization. I lost some of the normal behavior of my Wacom Graphics Tablet. I could open the drop-down menus and palettes. I could turn the DesignLayers on and off but I could no longer click in the design space. Could not select or rotate with the flyover tool. I could zoom with the gestures but the pan did not work. I could change the view with the numeric keypad. However, the commands to call a tool did not work.<br/>
<br/>
During this time the RAM was stable at 40GB / 64GB. <br/>
<br/>
I was able to shut down cleanly and save. The file closed quickly but the VW application took several minutes to close. <br/>
<br/>
After closing the program completely, the RAM went down to 8GB / 64GB.<br/>

The customer reported that the circuit number and connector type text on some circuits was upside down. Once they&#39;d clarified that this was in a viewport not on the design layer it became obvious. The viewport was set to Top view instead of Top/Plan and 3D text doesn&#39;t flip. The circuits in question were drawn destination to source and thus had to be flipped in order to look right.<br/>
<br/>
Logging this as a bug because although we know why it happens from the customer&#39;s point of view there is no reason for them to expect Top to look different from Top/Plan.

<br/>
We found a problem that when we apply an image fill on an object and rotate either the object or the image with the attributes mapping tool we get these white separation lines in between. We tried multiple images and we are wondering if this is a problem with the image or something to do with VW not joining them very well. <br/>

Please see screenshots attached and the images as well.

Also, the following sentence doesn&#39;t give any clue about what a user should do to proceed. But the mentioning suggests that a referenced file is involved (without a &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;possibly&quot;). This is wrong and misleading and puts the user further away from the solution compared to when there wouldn&#39;t be an error at all (which also won&#39;t be optimal, to be clear).<br/>
<br/>
The error text should be changed.

<br/>
Like its shown in the video. When writing in the text two, resulting in a bigger text box, the text three does not adapt to the new size of the text two box by not maintaing its distance. Only after we move the objects, they again refresh their supposed new position.<br/>
<br/>
It should be possible for the constraints to refresh their new position, without having to move the text box for a position refresh.<br/>

Please take a look at this. Thank you in advance.

<br/>
I hope it&#39;s visible in attached screenshot (see googledrive link) - I&#39;ve made two idetical in form sets of slabs and ramp.<br/>
The first one - on the left - has an upper slab which shape was made by cutting of 3D geometry from from rectangle slab.<br/>
The second one - on the right - has an upper slab which shape was made by hand by converting polygon into slab.<br/>
<br/>
As you may see (I hope), the red line on the edge of the slab, that presents the railing lenght, is propper only in the second case. In the first example tool seems not to &#39;see&#39; cuted geometry and treats the slab as if it was a rectangle not a polygon.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a more problem of the Railing tool or the Slab tool, but something is not right here, I think.

<br/>
When you place a custom cabinet from the library (cabinet with legs) the class &#39;vaste gebruikersvoorzieningen - kast - stelvoet&#39; is created.<br/>
When you check the settings of the symbol of the leg in the active drawing, this is the assigned class for these legs.<br/>
When you check the same settings in the library document, the class for these legs is &#39;active class&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached video<br/>
<br/>
We have a custom library but in our library there is neither this class nor a link to it anywhere.<br/>
Once the bib enters a drawing the class (which is translated) appears out of nowhere.<br/>
I also did the test with a new cabinet (so not from the library) in a blank document. As soon as you choose the option foot the class appears.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
There is a setting in Define Legend preview where the Vertical Dimension shows the window but not the door.(Please refer to attached &quot;Define Legend Image.vwx&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Define Legend of OIP &gt; Click the &quot;Define Legend Image&quot; button。<br/>
2) This occurs when the &quot;Define Legend Image&quot; dialog &gt; Annotations Tab &gt; Check Vertical Dimension is &quot;Frame + Still to Floor&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*Since the door is in contact with the floor, there is no need to display the height dimension from the bottom frame of the door to the floor.<br/>
The problem is that the dimensions of the frame/frame are not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
With this, when you try to display the height dimension from the floor of the window, the Vertical Dimension of the door frame will not be displayed.<br/>
Doors and windows cannot be written together in the same Define Legend. I think this is a specification bug.<br/>
<br/>

The text was created and copied in TextEdit. When the text is pasted into Vectorworks with &quot;Paste with Bitmap&quot;, the text is pasted as normal text instead of a bitmap. This also occurred in 2023.<br/>

This was found on the Sonoma Beta acceptance test machine (103201) but it is also seen in MacOS 12.6.

You can already notice that the text is misaligned vertically.<br/>
Becomes more visible if you use capital letters and change the colors.<br/>
<br/>
This also causes weird graphical glitches while changing Bold/Italic and other text options because the document is not redrawn outside of the text object&#39;s bounding box but the text extends beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
Note: I later discovered that this seems to be related to the Al Tarikh Regular font.

The enclosed Vectorworks file is from a Windows user. He says that when publishing locally after several hours he has to crash out. On my suggestion he used the Vectorworks Cloud Services and received the enclosed screenshot that Vectorworks had crashed on the cloud!<br/>
<br/>
Yet...I can publish in 5 minutes on my MBP and it took the VCS 25 minutes to publish for me. I realise that the VCS is all Windows, so why did I have such a difference experience than the user?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure about his OS if he&#39;s 10 or 11 but I would expect 11 from him. <br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                Gremlin characters sent to Lightwright via Data Exchange

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I recently had a Lightwright customer who couldn&#39;t get Data Exchange to work, he did everything right in Vectorworks, but when Lightwright tried to read the .xml file, it said the file was damaged and couldn&#39;t be opened.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this happen before, some kind of illegal character(s) get into the Vectorworks data fields, and so they go into the .xml file. Illegal characters are typically non-printing ASCII characters that can accidentally get into a VW text field.<br/>
<br/>
To solve the problem for the customer, I used Bbedit&#39;s &quot;Zap Gremlins&quot; feature on the .xml file, which let Lightwright read it and then send the repaired data back to Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this, Vectorworks should do a similar gremlins zap of the .xml data either before it writes it to disk or after it is in the .xml file.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a new problem, it has existed for years (and I&#39;ve been fixing user&#39;s data), but preventing it on the VW side is the only real solution.

Ideally the bounding box shown in the software could ignore light objects entirely? I&#39;ve verified that the sizes exported by the sizer script used to generate dimensions for .ifc data are effected by light objects and view zoom, and have a probability of being inaccurate due to the presence of light objects within the symbols.<br/>
<br/>
If I zoom the view of the file in far enough that the representations of the lights are within the geometry of the symbol I&#39;m able to get accurate results from the sizer script, and assume that the light objects are not effecting the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Light objects don&#39;t have a physical volume, so ideally they could be ignored when determining dimensions of bounding boxes.

So you can&#39;t correct the displayed angle of 10° with 5°, because then it takes the 10° + 5° and results in 15°. So if you now have 15° and really only want 5° you have to enter the angle 350° instead of 15° so it rotates almost 360° around.<br/>
my colleague who reported this bug is on vacation, so i only have the video at the moment. if you need the vwx file we can deliver it in 2-3 weeks.

When there are more then two elements meeting in one point, the joint doesn&#39;t look good. At least one of the elements doesn&#39;t have propper ending (see report: 0009644: Structural Member - joint representation).

The 4647.vwx document is referenced with the EPSG 4647, after exporting to DWG (dwg result also attached) and re-importing to Vectorworks we can see that in the DWG Import Settings the option &#39;This file contains georeferenced geomeytry&#39; is toggled off (screenshot attached).<br/>

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
Use a material from the resource manager. When you edit the material, under construction tab (constructie) some materials are registered as volume and some are registerd as surface only.<br/>

Is this intended? It&#39;s confusing for clients.<br/>

Because of this materials volumes or surface area&#39;s are not showing up in worksheets.

<br/>
I watched the video, and see that reproducing the problem requires two successive data exchanges with Lightwright.<br/>
<br/>
First, here is the user&#39;s report to us (he is using the current stable release of Lightwright 6.0.47):<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hi John,<br/>
<br/>
me again, found a more critical problem. Don’t know yet, if it is caused by VWX or LW. But it happens in VWX 2022 SP6 and VWX 2023 SP3. Newest LW Version<br/>
<br/>
Happens to me and my colleagues. Some are working with windows<br/>
 # Blank LW File (not my template), blank default vwx file, both in same same folder<br/>
<br/>
2. inserting instruments from VWX online library.<br/>
<br/>
3. setting up LW exchange<br/>
<br/>
4. instruments appear correct in LW<br/>
<br/>
5. grouping instruments in VWX<br/>
<br/>
6. in LW duplicates appear<br/>
<br/>
7. Duplicates don’t show up in VWX<br/>
<br/>
8. Refresh LD in VWX<br/>
<br/>
9. Duplicates still in LW<br/>
<br/>
10. “complete export on exit” in VWX<br/>
<br/>
11. in LW duplicates are identified<br/>
<br/>
I attached a video<br/>
<br/>
Best, Rob<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Reproducing it was complicated because video doesn&#39;t have any audio, is tiny, and moves very quickly. The version the user attached is from 2022 .vwx, while I&#39;m running 2023 here. So for testing, I opened his 2022 .vwx using 2023 SP3 and re-saved it. I was eventually able to reproduce the problem on 2023, but it might be easier for you to make it happen in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I did to successfully reproduce it, using the 2023 version of VW on 2023 .vwx files:<br/>
 * Did a Complete Export on Exit from VW<br/>
 * Looked at the .xml file using BBEdit, in it were 6 Forte and 6 T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Launched Lightwright, chose the .xml file<br/>
 * Got 6 Forte and 6 T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Clicked on VW, there are still 6 Forte and 6 T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Ungrouped the group of T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Clicked on LW, there are still 6 Forte and 6 T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Clicked on VW, did a full export on exit<br/>
 * The .xml is still correct with 6 of each<br/>
 * Clicked on LW, nothing changed, correct with 6 of each<br/>
 * Clicked on VW, nothing changed. Grouped the 6 T2 Profiles<br/>
 * Clicked on LW, there are now 6 Forte and *12* T2 Profiles.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why it took so many back and forths before the VW Group command added 6 new lights.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with bug hunting on this one, it&#39;s clearly reproducible, but I tried a variety of different steps and only the sequence shown above was bad.

<br/>
While the 2D joint representation works quite well (see other reports in that case), there&#39;s a big mistake made in 3D model. When two beams are joined together, not only the top and bottom parts (flangs) should fit properly, but also the middle one (web). There should definitely be no gap between webs. Otherwise such a join doesn&#39;t work from structural poit of view - I mean the most situations, exluding some exceptions.

In Germany we do use a comma for decimal separation and not a dot.<br/>
The worksheet itself works fine with country specific format of a number; for example when I type in 7.8 as a number it automatically turns to 7,8 which is correct.<br/>
But when I perform the function FesteDezimalstellen(10,123;3) which in English is Fixed(10.123,3) then the result is 10.123. This is not correct. In our german version the result should be 10,123.

<br/>
All 5 users<br/>
* are in the office<br/>
* use Windows 10<br/>
* use Vectorworks 2023 SP5<br/>
* use PSS (up-to-date: 23 May 2023) on Windows Server 2019 (virtualized with VMware) on RAID6 with 6 SATA-SSDs<br/>
* network uses VLANs<br/>
* switches have up-to-date firmware installed<br/>
* Trend Micro is installed, but Vectorworks application and user folders are whitelisted<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the lag occurs with one user, sometimes with another.<br/>
<br/>
When I tried the following steps on their computer through TeamViewer everything worked fine and quick:<br/>
* get a new working file<br/>
* save and commit changes of current objects<br/>
* save and commit with new objects<br/>
We tried the same with a local project file and it worked a bit better.<br/>
Manually transferring files (Windows Explorer) from the local PC to the server and back never took more than 5 seconds in each direction with the project file (about 570MB).<br/>
<br/>
Which files and other information do you need to help us trouble-shoot this further?

If a hardscape has a organic shape, has a border but the border is deleted at one or more edges, the display of that hardscape object will be very triangulated in Lumion.<br/>

I report this for Vectorworks 2023 SP6, since that&#39;s our latest localized version. The customer works on that version and since we don&#39;ty have Lumion at the office, I could only test this on the customer&#39;s computer.<br/>

I suppose this is a regression compared to version 2022, because in version 2022 herdscapes weren&#39;t triangulated yet.

When a symbol is linked to a story that doesn&#39;t exist, copying a symbol with a modified Z- value doesn&#39;t function as desired. The copy of the original object will have its Z- value reset to &quot;0&quot;. This causes unnecessary hassle and confusion to the user. The copy should retain the originals Z- value like it does with symbols which are not linked to a story.

                Worksheet TXT function does not handle complex criteria properly
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The Worksheet TXT function is supposed to allow the conversion of a value to a specified unit.  It works for simple cases, but does not work for a function containing a complex criteria.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, there are 4 lines. One in None Class, the other three in Dimension. Two in the Dimension class have a Pen Fore of red. The two red and the one in None have a record.field  (PTS.MKS) with a value of &#39;private&#39;. The document units are set to Feet.<br/>
<br/>
The worksheet in the file in column A is the &quot;case&quot; number, column B shows a text version (same formula but without the = so it does not evaluate) of the formula in column C.  Column D shows which returns I believe are correct or wrong. Column E is notes.<br/>
<br/>
The top 4 rows (cases 1-4) show various versions of a Length function using different simple (single criteria) and complex (two criteria ANDed together). For the Length function all of the options behave as expected.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom 10 (cases 5-14) rows show different versions of the TXT function.<br/>
<br/>
For cases 5 &amp; 6 rows (TXT of a manually entered value and TXT of a simple criteria Length function), the results appear correct.<br/>
<br/>
Case 7 used the Criteria Builder to generate the criteria for the Length function and it produced a wrong result. The only difference between the second and third functions is the extra parentheses generated by the Criteria Builder. It does not even return the correct value of the Length function and it returns a numeric value instead of the expected text string.<br/>
<br/>
Case 8 uses the same criteria as Case 6 plus adds the conversion to &#39;Meters&#39; and works correctly.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the cases all generate wrong results.<br/>
<br/>
Case 9 uses the Criteria Builder version of a simple criteria (extra parentheses) and returns the text &#39;Meters&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Case 10 uses the same criteria as Case 2 (parentheses around each of the sub-criteria only) and try to convert to meters. It returns the value of &#39;Meters&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Case 11 uses the same criteria as Case 4. Rather than returning a text string, it return the numeric value of the Length function/criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Case 12 uses the equivalent criteria to Case 11 and tries to convert the return to Inches. The return value is &quot;Inches&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Case 13 uses the equivalent criteria to Case 10, but using the record.field value instead of PenFore color and tries to convert to inches. The return value is &quot;Inches&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Case 14 uses the equivalent criteria to Case 13, but added the extra option parameters for Rounding Style and Rounding Accuracy.  It returns &quot;1/16&quot;, the last parameter.<br/>
<br/>
There appear to be several problems.<br/>
 # The Length formula inside a TXT is not evaluating properly. <br/>
 # In some cases the TXT function appears to be returning a number instead of the expected text string of the value.<br/>
 # The use of Criteria Builder constructed criteria (simple or complex) do not work when nested inside a TXT function.<br/>
 # When the TXT function gets a value it can not process properly it returns the last parameter in the function.<br/>
<br/>
The expected result is the TXT function should accept any other properly formatted worksheet function to generate the input number either using a manually created or Criteria Builder version of the function criteria.<br/>
<br/>
The return from the function should be the text string version of the input value. It there is an error, the function should return something indicating the error, probably an N/A or ERROR message. Returning the last parameter is not an acceptable error message.<br/>

VW has problems with 3D Rendering of Slabs + Modifiers with &quot;touching corners&quot;.<br/>

If you have a Slab with Modifiers of this situation,<br/>
you won&#39;t get any Rendering in 3D.<br/>
The 2D representation is not affected.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to upconvert from 2023 to 2024 AND<br/>
complete rebuild the situation in 2024 = both no success!<br/>

Many of the plug-ins (all of them in Vectorscript) are named with [Hankaku-kana|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-width_kana] and this can be the cause.<br/>
&quot;Kenchikubuzai&quot; (a third party product) has a lot (189) additional plug-ins and this number can be an additional cause.<br/>
I have attached a crash log with all the plug-ins installed.<br/>
Can you figure out the cause from this log file?<br/>

In version 2022, it was easy to control the 2D fill color of horizontal stiles in top/plan view. The big problem in v2022 though, was that the 2D fill for the Horizon stiles in top/plan view and in 3D/ section were synced. This is luckily resolved in v2023 en 2024.<br/>
In the last two versions, the horizontal stiles always show in top/plan view with a white fill, while the fill you set in the stiles settings will only be applied in 3D/ section.<br/>
If you want to choose another fill color than white though, it seems impossible.<br/>
There should be a way to control the top/plan fill color.

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is a BUG or a limitation of Data Tags.<br/>
<br/>
The syntax for Data Tags works only, if you use the predefined one,<br/>
with only capital/uppercase letters!<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
#AREA# = gives you a result<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
#Area# / #area# = gives you no result<br/>
<br/>
In Reports/Worksheets, the functions/formulas you write,<br/>
will always be converted to the correct working syntax.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if you write: AreA, aREa, area, areA, …<br/>
(or any other creative way of writing) <br/>
<br/>
With Data Tags the converting-option is not working.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this could be useful.<br/>
Lesser problems, lesser time for support!<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Tobi

Select the Sheet Layer 650, zoom and pan around the Sheet Layer several times. The Customer and I both experience temporary freezes and lag while navigating in the sheet layers. Double click one of the Viewports and enter the edit mode. Here also pan, edit zoom around several times and the same performance problems will happen.<br/>
<br/>
There is a visible lag between the mouse actions and when the action happens in Vectorworks. With the Windows 11 the problem is not as much visible, because of the hardware I am using, but with the Macbook the lag and freezing is very visible.<br/>
<br/>
The RAM used remains stable during the full process.<br/>

Computers used for the tests:<br/>
Windows 11 - 13th Gen i9-13900K 5.8GHz 24-Core, 64GB RAM and Radeon Pro WX 8200.<br/>

</td>

<br/>
1) In a blank Vectorworks file, use the &quot;Create Viewport...&quot; menu command from the View menu.<br/>
2) Choose to create a new design layer for the Viewport, then import the design layers from the attached &quot;Stair.vwx&quot; file.<br/>
3) Check the box to import the layer objects.<br/>
4) Press OK for the remaining dialogs, accepting all other default values.<br/>
<br/>
Notice how only one half of the stair (the proxy parent) is imported onto layer A, only one half of the stair appears in the Viewport, and there are no stair objects on layer B.  If you click and move the stair object on layer A, the proxy object that is supposed to be on layer B is created and now appears in the Viewport.<br/>

<br/>
if you try to copy cell-rows with content in VW-Worksheets,<br/>
there are some problems:<br/>
 * The object-list is not copied<br/>
(if you copy cell-row WITH object-list AND cell-rows WITHOUT object-list TOGETHER)<br/>
<br/>
OR (with a different copy-method = only the cell-row with object-list)<br/>
 * The cell settings like: Sort, Summarize Items, Sum Values, are not copied<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a screencast, which shows both problems.<br/>
<br/>
Copying is done with Shortcut:<br/>
<br/>
CMD + C<br/>
and<br/>
CMD + V<br/>
<br/>

Maybe this is a different flavor of the Detail Viewport in perspective or it was fixed in VB-198929.

<br/>
I float the Resource Manager, Navigation Palette, Visualization Palette, and Attributes Palette.<br/>
<br/>
Almost always once I move it and then try to move the palettes to the new external monitor the Attributes palette will disappear - it is nowhere on either monitor.<br/>
<br/>
The visualization palette will do this as well<br/>
<br/>
I have tried turning them on and off but it does not help.  In order to get them back In need to close VW, disconnect the external monitor, and then re-open.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This seems to only be happening on a PC as I have a class of students and the lab has external monitors that they connect with and it only happens on the PC, but not the mac computers.<br/>

This is not file-related but I have attached my workspace.<br/>

But in stead, this setting doesn&#39;t have any effect on the image size at all. This functionality doesn&#39;t seem to be working as it should.<br/>
So you&#39;d have to manually set the size (after manually measuring the size of the symbol, because usually you don&#39;t know/remember).

Our guess is that not all data types (popup in that case) are supported correctly in Vectorworks.<br/>

Recipe:<br/>
 * Open the attached [^16k_doors_v2024.vwx] file<br/>
 * Select all the doors in the file. It takes a very long time for the selection to finish<br/>
<br/>
(Selecting 16k rectangles ([^16k_rects_v2024.vwx]) is not that slow)<br/>
<br/>
If you see the attached hot path (that was taken from the profiler using VS2022), looks like the slowness comes from the data initialization of the OIP&#39;s Data pane, even if it&#39;s not visible. We might want to do it only when the Data pane is visible and only for the visible UI elements on the pane.

The customer tells us, that according to Graphisoft, the owner of DDS CAD, the missing IFCRELCONTAINEDINSPATIALSTRUCTURE.WR31 structure is the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a possible workaround for the customer? They say, that the receiver of their IFC files cannot use them in their current state.<br/>

The customer uses many wall objects in different classes to then map different entities to them: IfcFooting, IfcFurniture, IfcWasteTerminal, IfcStair, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In Vectorworks everything looks fine, and in BIMcollabZOOM the resulting entities are partly correct, but mostly wrong.

If you look at the info palette, you can see that the status is set to &quot;-&quot; (undefined) and ByStyle.<br/>

If you use the Export Options with &quot;Separate Instances&quot; for Walls the openings of Windows and Doors are missing in IFC4.<br/>

Please try to fix this bug for 2024 SP0.<br/>

<br/>
In version 2022, when you click on &quot;Edit- reset all plug ins&quot;, the alignment of the hardscapes is not updated (which is what the customer wanted, because he doesn&#39;t want alignment to update when he&#39;s satified with the current geometry), but dispite that, the red &quot;dirty&quot; indication rectangles disappear. The customer used that in a way to &quot;accept&quot; a current state of alignments.<br/>
<br/>
In version 2023, clicking on &quot;Edit- reset all plug ins&quot; also doesn&#39;t update the hardscape alignments, but the &quot;dirty&quot; rectangle stays. So it is more difficult for the customer to differentiate between alignments he already &quot;accepted&quot; and alignments which still might need an update.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s clearly a difference in behavior between version 2022 and 2023. But I&#39;m not sure which behavior is the designed behavior. Maybe the 2023 behavior as a regression, as the customers supposes, or was the customers using a bug in 2022 in his advantage? Or is there actually a bug in both? (maybe &quot;reset all plug ins&quot; should actually update alignments?).<br/>
<br/>
I tried to discuss this with Tech support, but they didn&#39;t answer. I don&#39;t know anywhere else to go with this user&#39;s question then here. Thanks in advance for clarifying whether this is a bug or WAD.

this is an issue I cannot test myself because it is Windows and One Drive.<br/>
Customer is reporting that workgroup folder is not working properly when shared on One Drive.<br/>
You can see the content in resource browser and download the symbols ot styles, e.g. a door style. No problem here.<br/>
But replacing a style on object info palette (option style/replace...) of an inserted styled object does not work correct. You see the defaults from Vectorworks library but not the workgroup folder on One Drive.<br/>
I always thought resource browser and resource pop-up from an plug-in object do show the same.<br/>
Do you experience the same? Is it a bug?

And while I have demonstrated the issue in the video using only one mode of the radial dimension too, all modes of the tool produce similar (incorrect) results.<br/>
<br/>
When creating construction documentation, it would be necessary to show the radius of the curved wall in order for a builder to construct the wall as accurately as possible.

When you change the settings on the fence railing object, do you have the ability to select a symbol from an external file. I believe this should import the symbol into your current file and then apply it to the fence railing object.<br/>
<br/>
This only works if the symbols that you choose is inside the current file. This means that you have to import the symbol into your current file before activating the fence railing settings dialogue box and then choosing the fence symbol you want to apply.

                Using Advanced Properties dialog to change Attributes of multiple Section VPs also changes all Extents 
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      On a sheet with multiple Section Viewports, each viewport tends to have different &quot;Extents&quot; settings under Advanced Section Properties. For example, one viewport might need to display 4&#39; beyond the cut plane, another might need to display 8&#39; beyond the cut plane, and another might have this setting set to Infinite.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Extents tab, the Advanced Section Properties window ALSO has tabs for Attributes and Display.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I need to change something on the Attributes or Display tabs and I want it to apply to all selected Section Viewport at once; for example, I might want to universally change the Attributes Class for sectioned objects, or to change all the viewports to display Black &amp; White, or to change the 3D Conversion resolution.<br/>
<br/>
To do this, I select all the viewports and open the Advanced Properties window via the OIP. However, doing this unknowingly makes ALL viewports have ALL the same parameters across all three tabs, not solely the parameters that you&#39;ve changed. Essentially it wipes out all of the Extents settings for all the Section Viewports, making them all match, even though the only thing you meant to change is some other parameter on another tab. This is very bad. (And I don&#39;t think Viewport Styles in 2024 addresses this problem.)<br/>
<br/>
Either it needs to be fixed so that _only_ the settings that are actively changed get pushed to all selected viewports, OR the Advanced Properties window needs to get separated into two windows: one for Extents, and one for Attributes &amp; Display. The latter would actually make Section Viewports match Horizontal Section Viewports which already have one button for &quot;Cut Plane &amp; Extents&quot; and another button for &quot;Advanced Properties.&quot; Consistency with how different viewports work would be very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is both a VB and a VE, but I&#39;m filing it as a VB for now.

<br/>
In short, I am working in 2D drafting. I have a master floor plan that has walls 1, walls 2, roof, &amp; grids (among other elements). I have referenced that to a sheet specific file for each floor plan, and roof plan. I have a design layer viewport that has the geometry from the referenced master floor plan (walls 1 and grids for instance). I then have a sheet layer viewport that captures the DLVP and any other additional information on local design layers.<br/>
<br/>
When I open the target file, all the geometry shows up in the DLVP/SLVP except the grid bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
If I open the layers dialog for the DLVP, toggle the wall layer(s) visibility (i.e. make walls 1 invisible and walls 2 visible for a first floor plan sheet) the grids show up. If I then toggle the walls back to the way I originally had it, the grids remain visible until I close the file.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried simply toggling the visible walls, but that does not seem to cause the grid bubbles to show.<br/>
<br/>
I have also attached the master and target files for your use

The command &quot;Import Point Cloud&quot; ignores the user origin. From my point of view a &quot;rule&quot; in Vectoworks is that all tools should support the user origin when import or export data.<br/>

                Worksheet: the issue with pasting formulas from other applications into Vectorworks

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      We are talking about the apostrophe characters being changed by other applications like Word, Excel, Slack, PDF, and so on. Often apostrophe characters are changed to different styles of quotation marks or even grave accents, which of course will not work within formulas pasted into worksheets, data manager mapping, or data tag fields.<br/>
<br/>
The issue is so old, it has a long beard by now, and the issue is global - meaning: it affects many applications, where code needs the correct format to work properly.<br/>
<br/>
And even though it&#39;s not the fault of Vectorworks for this (external) issue to happen, similarly to a different issue I reported previously (VB-169809), I think that it&#39;s in the hand of Vectorworks to fix the (internal) issue.<br/>
<br/>
Our customers usually are not knowledgable about coding, formulas or syntax highlighting. And because of that, they might not spot errors caused by this issue or in the worst case conclude that there is an issue with Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
This (external) issue is not going away, and with more and more customers starting to apply the BIM workflow, and therefore use formulas more often, more and more people will eventually run into this issue.<br/>
<br/>
For a simple demonstration I attached a short video to illustrate the issue with the following formula:<br/>
<br/>
{{ =MATPROPERTYBYNAME(COMPONENTMATERIAL(T=index), &#39;Bauteil-ID.KG - 3.Ebene&#39;)}}<br/>

The first of the enclosed movies shows the differences between the same file in v2023 SP6 and 2024 b3. <br/>
Firstly the mask doesn&#39;t appear to be working. In 2023 when zooming you see the model of the hall table appear but it disappears when you stop zooming. <br/>
<br/>
The second movie shows when editing the Annotation group and you have the Camera Match object selected if you click &#39;Show Control Lines&#39; you might get a flash of them but mostly nothing apart from the selection handles of the perspective widgets. They only appear if you click the &#39;Fine Tune View&quot; but note the background image reappears on itself at the top right. This obscures the perspective widgets and makes editing them impossible.<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday, I needed to create a screenshot of the &quot;Create Report&quot; dialog in Fundamentals. I activated this command via Tools &gt; Reports... &gt; Create Report and the dialog that popped up looked like the format of the Preformatted reports window, but the window was empty:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I tried quitting and restarting Vectorworks but that did not solve it. I tried restarting my computer but that did not solve it.<br/>
<br/>
With Vectorworks not running I removed my user folder, then restarted Vectorworks. A new user folder was created and then the Create Report command would generate the expected dialog window.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what happened within my User folder to cause the blank report window to appear, but I have kept the &quot;broken&quot; user folder if you would like to inspect it. (I tried to attach it to this submission but it is 1.63GB and the system would not allow it to be attached.)<br/>
<br/>
While it is quite unlikely that a customer would swap serial numbers as I have been doing, I thought I should report this bug in case it reveals a weakness we should address.<br/>

Some subparts definitions are not calculated in the worksheet.<br/>
Related:TOV-2307<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1)Open VW2023SP4.<br/>
2)Create three types of Railing with &quot;No Post&quot;, &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;Wall Bracket&quot; by the Railing/Fence tool.<br/>
3)Create a worksheet.  Go to Resource Manager&gt;New Resource... &gt; Create &quot;Worksheet&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4)Select any cell(Ex.A1) and select &quot;Database&quot; menu &gt; Database command.<br/>
<br/>
5)Select &quot;Find objects that meet the following criteria&quot; as &quot;Type,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; and &quot;Railing/Fence&quot; and click OK.<br/>
6) Click the lower triangle in Database Header call(Ex.A1) .<br/>
<br/>
7)Select &quot;Function&quot; &quot;Specialized for Railing/Fence&quot; &quot;Height(profile)&quot; and click OK.<br/>
8)In the input field of Database Header call(Ex.A1), enter &quot;=HEIGHT(&#39;PROFILE&#39;, &#39;subpart=toprail&#39;)&quot; and click the check button to display the correct values.<br/>
However, the parameter of the following subparts is not calculated and comes out as N/A.<br/>

-I realize customers are probably not going to assign the same tag to every class, however, functionality is the same if you select a block of classes also<br/>
-You&#39;ll see in the attached, &quot;WindowsOrgDialog&quot; video, I&#39;m able to add the tag to all the classes, where this is not possible in the, &quot;MacOrgDialgo&quot; video<br/>
-I don&#39;t know which functionality is correct, Mac or Win?  I&#39;m thinking Mac and here&#39;s why...<br/>
<br/>
In comparison, If you select all the Classes in the Navigation palette, on Windows, it&#39;s not possible to right click and Assign Tags, like you can in the Organization dialog.  Same on the Mac, selecting all classes in the Navigation palette and right clicking in the palette, does not allow you to Assign Tags.<br/>

a customer uses symbols to specify where specific population of animals were living.<br/>
Those symbols contain a circle and a text which is the abbrevation for a specific animal family.<br/>
He is scaling the symbols by 2.5. And exactly that seem to cause a problem.<br/>
The map and symbols are on design layer 1:1000 and are displayed in a sheet layer viewport scale 1:5000.<br/>
If the drawing is saved while sheet layer is active and is reopened then the text of the symbol is missing.<br/>
If the drawing is saved while design layer is active then everything is fine.<br/>
<br/>
It is windows only. I have tested with windows 10 and 2023 SP4.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac the text is still visible but the width of the text field got smaller , so only a small part of the text is missing. Not nice, but the text is still visible.<br/>
<br/>
You can repair the symbols by editing them in resource browser. But the moment you save while sheet layer is active the symbols are corrupted again.<br/>
<br/>
See Video, my testfiles and original testfile customer.<br/>

<br/>
As example, in the attached Vectorworks test document we have a wall with 3 Window CW Objects.<br/>
<br/>
One Window with Einfügepunkt: Links (Oject Info option)<br/>
One Window with Einfügepunkt: Mitte(Oject Info option)<br/>
One Window with Einfügepunkt: Rechts(Oject Info option)<br/>
<br/>
When using the  Dimension horizontal tool, like its shown in the attached video, the Durchbruchhöhe is only displayed in the Window with &quot;Einfügepunkt: Mitte&quot; and it should be displayed in all the three Windows.<br/>
<br/>
The Window CW Plug-In is attached to be possible to test this, although the problem is from the Dimension Tool, the Plug-In is necessary to replicate with the same options (Window Einfügepunkt).

I then realise that I wrongly created the second load as Audio, and should have used Light. I change the category to Light.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-08-08-15-07-02-031.png|width=564,height=103!<br/>
<br/>
But now, both the old Audio class and the new Light class will now turn off the load, whereas it should only be controlled by Light.<br/>
<br/>
This behaviour will only include the previous load category assignment. So if I then assign it to Video, it will be controlled by Light and Video, but no longer Audio.<br/>
<br/>
This applies the same to Point and Distributed loads.

 <br/>
_Hi Troy,_<br/>
 <br/>
_Tim here. Kevin’s in a meeting until lunch so answering in his absence..._<br/>
 <br/>
_Silent installation: We’ve previously used the 2023 Silent Installation method to roll out and install the full version without problems._<br/>
 <br/>
_Previous use: I believe we have used the CLI update method before (briefly, and not with vw2023)._<br/>
 <br/>
_As an aside, since VW started using its separate updater app we have struggled to script the VW updates. Even when using the GUI, updates failed. To apply a service pack, we resorted to deleting the VW installation and installing a fresh full version._ <br/>
 <br/>
_Is there a recent how-to for updates as opposed to full installation? I used [this article|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/how-to/installation/vectorworks-updater-command-line-guide-r844/] yesterday, but it is for VW2020._ <br/>
 <br/>
_Anyway, yesterday I used this command to create a generic offline updater:_<br/>
_/Applications/Vectorworks\ 2023/Vectorworks\ 2023\ Updater.app/Contents/Resources/cli.sh download-generic-update --platform m /Users/Shared SP5_  <br/>
 <br/>
_Notes are:_ <br/>
 * _The {{--platform m}} option is undocumented_<br/>
 * _The updater file was as large as the full installer_ <br/>
 * _The resultant generic update file failed when I double-clicked it in a GUI session. (It failed at around the 98% complete mark.)_<br/>
_{color:#222222}That’s my two cents. Kevin might add more once he’s back.{color}_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_Kind regards,_<br/>
<br/>
_Tim_<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*And another response…*<br/>
<br/>

_Troy,_<br/>
 <br/>
_Thanks for your reply._<br/>
 <br/>
_Yes both script and GUI do not currently work, as the official VW base installer seems to not create the proper permissions to start with._<br/>
 <br/>
_From memory this started happening when VW introduced the new updater mechanism._<br/>
 <br/>
_Please note for obvious reasons we do not allow local users admin privileges, which is best practice and works for all other apps except VW._<br/>
 <br/>
_We trust the above provides enough feedback to get your devs to sort this out - btw. it seems they eventually managed to get things working for VW2022._<br/>
 <br/>
_Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries or require any additional information._<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_Kind regards,_<br/>
<br/>

*And another response…*<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
_Hi Troy,_<br/>
 <br/>
_Tim here. We’ll agree to differ on that point._<br/>
 <br/>
_To clarify, the update methods we have tried:_<br/>
 * _Using CLI : failed_<br/>
 * _Using Vectorworks 2023 Updater app as non-admin user : failed_<br/>
 * _Using Vectorworks 2023 Updater app as admin user : failed_<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
_I just tried the GUI updater as admin this afternoon. It was upgrading from SP4 to SP5. It got to approx 85% complete then failed. It displayed this note: “An unknown error has occurred. Please contact technical support.” The VW updater helper log is attached for your reference._<br/>
 <br/>
_Please let us know what the best approach is to get VW2023 updated._<br/>
<br/>
_Kind regards,_<br/>
<br/>

- Dragging directly from the resource manager and dropping into a document creates an instance that has the record.<br/>
- Using the plug-in tool creates instances that don&#39;t have the record.<br/>
<br/>
This can be seen with many styled plug-ins, such as Plant, Cable, Cabinet, Hardscape, etc., while others such as Window and Door work differently - i.e. the record always follows the creation of an instance (which seems to be the correct behavior).<br/>
<br/>
Not sure whether it is a bug or a WAD.<br/>
Maybe something just needs to be changed in some plug-in tools, or maybe a more general change is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Attached are two videos demonstrating this behavior - [^Hidden Records for plants.mp4]from [~kollikainen] and another [^records attached to plug-in styles.mp4] from me.

                Repeatable VGM complete graphics crash with simple file, possibly related to Data Viz?

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
As you can see in the 5 minute enclosed movie when placing a {color:#4C9AFF}blue symbol{color} on the page there are mixed results. Sometimes the screen freezes but usually I am able to place it onto the page. The repeatable part is when that is deleted and another {color:#4C9AFF}blue symbol{color} is attempted to be placed the screen has freezes I suspect as soon as I activate the {color:#4C9AFF}blue symbol{color}.<br/>
<br/>
If closed and reopened usually you get an entire grey window. Any new files are also grey. The only choice is to quit and reopen.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that changing the Prefs eg turning off:<br/>
Vectorcaching<br/>
Accelerated Graphics <br/>
<br/>
and the Doc Prefs of turning off:<br/>
VGM cache<br/>
<br/>
...makes no difference.<br/>
<br/>
Also note and this is an ongoing problem I regularly see and I might have to do a separate VB is that you can see that the Renderworks Background doesn&#39;t always stick.<br/>
<br/>
The file is very simple - 6 walls, floor and ceiling. One layer in turquoise is a floor because the Renderworks background is unreliable and I had to make some movies with a background (I could have changed the interactive prefs I know).<br/>
<br/>
The {color:#4C9AFF}Blue Symbols{color} are a collection of banquet tables and chairs all with the glassware invisible in a class called &#39;Table Setting&#39; but they are not even drawn. There is a stage and some symbols and a video screen object.<br/>
<br/>
The file was set up to show Convention Centres how easy it is to have regular room set ups saved as library items and to be able to drag and drop onto the page.<br/>
<br/>
While the file was recently created in 2023 SP5 the same thing happens in that version.<br/>
<br/>
Clue: I recently added some Data Viz to show these people how easily you could even change the colours of the tablecloths and seat covers. In the enclosed movie you can see that no Data Viz was applied, but I mention this just in case there&#39;s a link.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously with such a simple file this makes the program unworkable and I have to edit the movies for these potential users! <br/>
I&#39;m on a MBP M1 32 Core 64GB UM.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

                Question: Redshift rendering with a CPU that lacks integrated graphics.
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Our sales team has recently tested multiple PCs with various specifications. <br/>
One of the PCs encountered an error while running the Redshift final render. <br/>
The error message stated, &quot;Failed to allocate necessary GPU recyclable memory. Aborting the render.&quot; <br/>
This PC&#39;s GPU has 4GB VRAM, which falls short of the minimum requirement for Redshift when using GPU rendering alone. However, it does have 16GB of RAM. <br/>
As per the system requirements for VW2023, if the GPU doesn&#39;t meet the requirement, the CPU will be used for Redshift rendering. <br/>
However, it doesn&#39;t seem to be going well with it.<br/>
<br/>
Could the absence of integrated graphics on the CPU be causing the problem?<br/>
<br/>
PC Specs:<br/>
Manufacturer: Mouse Computer<br/>
CPU: Intel Core i5-13400F<br/>
RAM: 16GB<br/>
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6<br/>
<br/>
Attached a file for testing and a movie that shot the scene of the problem. The problem only occurs on a design layer.<br/>

A couple days ago something happened, that apparently caused the project file to lose most of its contents.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the setup:<br/>
* the project file has a number of references, but importantly it has the file 651_E_SN-AN.vwx referenced<br/>
* 651_E_SN-AN.vwx has the project file in its references<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what the customer described:<br/>
She had the work file open, but was working on 651_E_SN-AN.vwx. At some point she notices, that all referenced viewports are empty. That&#39;s when she checks the project file and finds it almost empty.<br/>

                Migration Manager converts Favorites aliases to non-aliases (duplicate files)

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Adding a file from a User Library to Favorites will create an alias.<br/>
<br/>
However, when running Migration Manager, it converts those aliases to non-alias files. For clarification, that means that there are now duplicate files in both Favorites and nested folders in the User Library. So if a user edits a resources in one file, the other file&#39;s resources are not updated. Now the user has two sets of resources (some are up to date; some aren&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
*Fix: when migrating Favorites aliases, they should continue to be aliases.* Thinking this through, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s tricky because the original file would have to be migrated / converted first, and then VW would create an alias of that file. Therefore, it wouldn&#39;t be migrating the alias itself. That sounds like some futuristic AI. Regardless, however this issue is fixed, the user&#39;s original files should never be duplicated / forked into two sets of non-alias files. At the very least, alias files should not migrate at all (if that&#39;s the only way to to prevent duplication). *In fact,* this would be a fantastic opportunity for the *MigrationManagerDetailedReport.txt* to report what *wasn&#39;t* migrated (the aliases in Favorites).

This leads to confusion, causing the user to incorrectly assume those files didn&#39;t migrate (although they did; they&#39;re just not visible).<br/>
<br/>
Running the Refresh Libraries command will reveal them. However, running that command is not necessary to reveal the other files that were migrated; only Favorites files. Hence, this issue is a VB not a VE.<br/>
<br/>
*Fix: when Migration Manager finishes, all migrated files, including Favorites, should be visible in the Resource Manager.* If that&#39;s not possible for some reason, worst case scenario: Migration Manager should prompt the user to Refresh Libraries after finishing.

                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains two objects (an EAP and an Extrude) on different layers, with the Layer Options currently set to &quot;Show Others&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 - Select the EAP and run the &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; command<br/>
<br/>
Note that the command unexpectedly fits to the bounds of the Extrude, even though it&#39;s not selected.<br/>
 - Now change the Layer Options to Show/Snap/Modify Others<br/>
 - Change the projection to Orthogonal<br/>
 - Select the EAP and run &quot;Fit to Objects&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that now if you change back to the original setup (Show Others and Perspective) the &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; command works as expected.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how the file got into this state, but it was being worked on by Luis using the 3DConnexion Space Navigator (so he&#39;s always working in Perspective). I haven&#39;t been able to get it back into the bad state but I&#39;m hoping the code will give more clues.

Note that this works fine in VW 2022 but fails in VW 2023. It also fails in VW 2024. <br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen with all Site Models, so it looks like there&#39;s something specific about this one that&#39;s causing it.

In the dwg-file (me I have opened it in AutoCAD) a hatch which comes from a referenced file is missing.<br/>
The customer files are 2022. I have exported them to 2021 in order to test in Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
Performing export in Vectorworks 2021, the hatch is visible.<br/>
Performing export in Vectorworks 2022 or 2023 SP4, the hatch is missing.<br/>

<br/>
I encountered an issue with symbols being rotated and misplaced in a DWG Export.<br/>
<br/>
In this project I had to deal with a lot of imported geometry. A DWG from the project was required. When examining the DWG that was generated from VW I found that various symbols had been misplaced and rotated in a seemingly random way. <br/>
<br/>
The thing that al these symbols have in common is that they contain 3D Poly&#39;s. Some symbols are only 3d Poly&#39;s and som symbols have a combination of both 3D poly&#39;s and other geometry.<br/>
<br/>
After the export to DWG the 3D Polys inside the symbol are misplaced and rotated within the symbol. The symbols that contain both 3d poly&#39;s and other geometry only the 3D poly&#39;s are misplaced, the other geometry remains in it&#39;s correct location. <br/>
<br/>
After a lot of trial and error I noticed first that if only one layer containing some of the symbols in question is exported from an ISO or custom view. The problem does not occur. If the other layers are turned on for export the problem occurs again. <br/>
<br/>
Then I found that if all the layers are exported together and the export is made from a top 3D view then the problem does not occur anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So there is a workaround, but this seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed as is can confuse and delay users that are not aware of the workaround.<br/>
<br/>
Please see the screenshots and example files attached<br/>

-The first dialog &quot;_Textures for this object cannot be edited with attribute mapping tool_&quot;.<br/>
-Then the second second dialog will appear, &quot;_Attribute mapping will only work with object<br/>
  that has textures.&quot;_ which is a confusing/conflicting message.<br/>
-But the issue is, the first dialog will only appear once throughout the session of vectorworks, <br/>
 the user could use some other tool and inadvertently use the attribute tool again. And the <br/>
 first  message dialog will never  again, only the second conflicting message dialog will <br/>

<br/>
If the &#39;Reset All Plug-Ins&#39; command is run (while in a Design Layer) and then the file is saved, the file will reopen with the benefit of having run that command still in effect. If the command is run while in a Design Layer, but the file is saved while in a Sheet Layer, when that file is reopened the benefit of having run Reset All Plug-Ins is lost. - The problem is reinstated. <br/>

This relates to my other recent submission VB-193455 and the objects in the SLVP are invisible when the file in question is opened. It also relates to my more recent submission VB-193041. <br/>

<br/>
The Customer has written the following message:<br/>
&quot;When exporting a project ifc, some data on windows and walls is missing. In the Classification and Material databases, I have linked individual data fields with component data. When I check the export in Solibri, the Classification database is empty and material is completely missing. The model is exported in ifc version 4.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this. Why with IFC 2x3 the objects and data is being exported and with IFC 4 is not? What do we have to do to get the objects and data also exported with IFC 4? Thank you in advance.

They claim, that normal extrudes (IfcExtrudedAreaSolid) are much easier to handle for calculations compared to BREPs (IfcFacetedBrep). And the issue is, that for some reason during export for the German window with rolling shutters two opening elements, that are part of a Wall Hole Group, are merged into a BREP rather than into a solid made of several solids, an IfcCsgSolid.

Using the eyedropper tool you can transfer the IFC Data (which doesn&#39;t differ from what I saw) to other column, these other columns will now also be exported with the material set in the mapping.

<br/>
Story names are given in the IFC export dialog when setting up the design layer to story mapping.<br/>
<br/>
This name then magically appears in the name field of the IfcBuildingStorey property set. I say &quot;magically&quot;, because the default formula &quot;=CONCAT(NAME; &#39;IfcBuildingStorey&#39;)&quot; only outputs 0IfcBuildingStorey.<br/>
<br/>
If the name was correctly mapped to the name field this wouldn&#39;t even be such a big issue, but our customers want and need to attach information that is of course contingent on the current story that is being processed and thus any formula with IF or IFS will fail, because the name field does not really contain the story name.<br/>
<br/>
We would prefer having worksheet functions to get all non-object field information.

In the attached file the fields &quot;Name&quot; &amp; &quot;Description&quot; of ifcCovering (mapped for wall components) has the same formula mapped, but only the field Description receive the mapping. Is this a bug or is the Name field deliberately exported with for the user unchangeable values?<br/>

Export sphere as IFC. The positioning of a sphere is not correct after IFC export in Solibri Viewer. This is probably an export bug. If you convert the sphere to NURBS the geometry is in the right place.<br/>

&quot;The data manager is incorrectly programmed. We wanted to do a data visualization with the database field &quot;SelfClosing&quot; - we noticed that the visualization was wrong. During research, I noticed that the assignment in the data manager is programmed using a boolean. But in the door via the IFCPset_DoorCommon there is a choice of 3 possibilities: true, false, undefined. It means it colors all undefined doors as well, since it reads it as 1 in the boolean.

<br/>
This is shown with Stair Objects as an example, but can also be reproduced with the US Windows objects.<br/>
<br/>
When clicking on the object, like shown in the video, and selecting &quot;Edit 2D Component&quot; we get two different Pop-Ups:<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;Other objects will not be shown because this is a flipped plug-in object.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;The active component is currently plug-in-generated. Any edits will convert it to a user-provided component that will no longer be updated by the plug-in object.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards (Screenshot 3) we can see that the object is not being shown like warned in the first pop-up.<br/>
<br/>
When doing the exact same thing on the second Stair Object, like its also shown in the video, this does not happen anymore and the Stair is displayed. All stairs have the same settings and we do not believe this problem is from the Stair Plug-In, but a Vectorworks general problem, since the same can be reproduced with the US Windows objects as another example.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
Original Customer message (translated to english):<br/>
<br/>
I want my stairs to have a custom 2D representation on the top floor (not on the floor where the 3D stairs sit, but on the next floor).<br/>
<br/>
Custom renderings are done by right-clicking on the stair and clicking &quot;Edit 2D Rendering&quot;. This brings up an option where whatever my stair looked like I can edit it. I created an icon for the 2D representation, which I then grouped and gave the correct level of detail (set like the original elements). Those representations worked for a while, and now they&#39;re gone. It can&#39;t be that I can change a display and then, at the whim of the program, it&#39;s gone again. The Stairs sometimes show that they have Custom Appearances but are not visible.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is the file with these errors and marked which stair is correct and which is wrong. You see 2 parts of the building: On the left is the representation as it should be (I have just adjusted it again, and on the right is how it looked this morning, with the representations completely deleted! This problem is repeated on all floors, if you want to see that, except in UG where the Custom Appearance is still visible.<br/>
<br/>
The references are not relevant to the problem, they are set correctly. Nevertheless, in this version are gone.<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
it seems that it is currently not possible to create a custom 2D representation of the stairs.

<br/>
Import Point Cloud with GIS ( not using the option center on internal origin) but using the geolocate tool to place the internal origin at the center of the Point Cloud results in poor quality display<br/>
<br/>
This is a bug because the Point Cloud is centered on the internal origin<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
2023 SP5 (Build 702742)<br/>
<br/>
In Bugs 2023 folder you can find 2 files:<br/>
- Import Point Cloud without GIS (using the option center on internal origin) results in a clear view of the Point Cloud<br/>
<br/>
- correctly georeferenced - bad display<br/>

                SBE: Interactive reshape uses incorrect elevation if parent wall of PIO is not on z=0

Our PIO has a sill height of 0.9m (above layer) and passes this value as elevation in  OnGetInteractiveSizingParams. But the modification points as well as the data bar use 0.78m instead (0.12m is just the difference between layer Z and bottom of wall). <br/>
<br/>
Even if we reshape the width only and leave  height / elevation unchanged, the sill height goes down to 0.78m.<br/>
<br/>
The weird thing is that from now on the modification points seem to be correct.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect an initialization problem like the one we had before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching the PIO and the testfile (Mac, debug).

<br/>
However, there is a calculation limitation when the plan has a 0.08 degree rotation or less. For example, if we draw a -90 degree line on a plan that has a 0.08 degree rotation, the OI will automatically show the value as if the plan was not rotated. This means that the OI shows -90.08 degrees instead of -90 degrees, while the plan shows a rotation of 0.08 degrees. While the plan is rotated, as example still 0.08 degrees, the object OI should show -90 degrees and only switch to -90.08 degrees when we remove the plan rotation by 0.08.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
I want to know Vectorworks 2022 and 2023 does supported or not whether Kerberos authentication for network authentication.<br/>
<br/>
* The user who asked this question was originally using Vectorworks 2021, but suddenly it appeared that the license was about to expire, and it seems that he noticed that the activation could not be performed.<br/>
 I heard that you found out that there was a change in the network specifications after confirming with the person.<br/>
<br/>
* The content that the user was told by the person in charge of the network is as follows.<br/>
Changed the specification so that communication with &quot;authentication headers that do not support Kerberos authentication&quot; is not processed due to Kerberos authentication settings.<br/>
<br/>
* I thought it would be quicker if the user actually checked it on the actual machine, so I emailed the serial number of the evaluation version (2022 and 2023) held by support and the download destination of the installer. We received a reply that due to the circumstances of the parent company, it is not possible to install the currently approved application.<br/>

Would you please give us some information to solve the following problem?<br/>
<br/>
When selecting &quot;Save as PDF...&quot; in the print command, the default file name is set to &quot;Untitled 1&quot; instead of the vwx file name.<br/>
<br/>
■ Customer&#39;s reproduction machine<br/>
Mac mini<br/>
Model ID: ID 14,3<br/>
Chip: Apple M2<br/>
Memory: 16GB<br/>
macOS: Ventura 13.4<br/>
<br/>
■ Information provided by the customer regarding this issue<br/>
- The Export PDF command defaults to the vwx file name and does not occur.<br/>
- Reproduced under the following conditions.<br/>
 1) New file. *Reproduced with the file name &quot;123.vwx&quot;.<br/>
 2) Initialize the user folder.<br/>
 3) Start macOS in safe mode.<br/>
<br/>
- Does not reproduce in Apple genuine apps (Safari, Preview, Mail, Notes).<br/>
- Just in case, we have obtained a reproduction file [^test0425.vwx] from the customer. And even if we used the reproduction file, we were unable to confirm the reproduction.<br/>
- As a trial, with a newly created account on macOS, the problem did not occur for a few days, but after that the problem started to occur.<br/>
- The customer tried it on another machine (MacBookPro (intel Corei7)), but it did not reproduce on that machine.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Takaaki Mizuno<br/>

Please have a look at attached movie. The symbols that were selected in the resource browser were not <br/>
 clipped correctly in the LB cell. <br/>
The interaction type of the cell is kListBrowserItemInteractionEditResource. For more details please have a look at the code snippet below.<br/>
Just call function &quot;lm_dialog_testen&quot;() to create the dialog.<br/>

<br/>
From user: I was replicating a technique I&#39;d seen on the Forum in posts from 2018 where you could create a Clip Cube-style SLVP but which instead of having a solid colour on the cut plane would display the 2D representation of the components. So essentially the same as a normal section VP but in a 3D view. This worked in 2018 but is no longer working in 2023. I have not tried it in the earlier versions I have loaded (2021 + 2022). This would be a useful technique to be able to use + just interested to know why it doesn&#39;t work anymore. Thanks.

(2) Space size by range<br/>

The DV works when these options are enable separately but when both options are enabled, one space objects doesn&#39;t get assigned option (2). It seems like an odd behavior.<br/>

Also, sometimes when I cycle through the DV options, I get some random results where all objects work with option (1), when at the same time both options (1) and (2) are enabled.

To reproduce:<br/>

- Open the Define Legend Image dialog<br/>
- Apply a class override for Image-1<br/>
- Now switch to Image-2<br/>

Note that the class list still shows the icon indicating that &quot;Class A&quot; is in an overridden state for Image-2, when the override is really only applied to Image-1.<br/>

This is a regression from VW 2023, where the class lists updated correctly when the active Image was changed.<br/>

This doesn&#39;t happen every time. If you don&#39;t see it at first, you may need to do a clean launch, make this the only open file, and/or run the Update All Viewports command immediately after opening the file.<br/>
<br/>
If I update the viewports sheet-by-sheet, I don&#39;t see a crash.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this on Windows 10 so it might be Mac-only.<br/>

<br/>
In the attached test file we have 500 stair objects as an example of an Intelligent Object, the problem can be reproduce with any other Intelligent Object that is linked to Layer Elevation.<br/>
<br/>
After selecting all objects and selecting Copy (Ctrl+C) and the Layer Elevation is zero, the operation is instant.<br/>
<br/>
If we set the Layer Elevation to, as example, 5 meters then it will need 36 seconds for the operation to conclude. Note that opening the Edit menu and clicking on Fit to Objects also takes several extra seconds (also shown in the video).<br/>
<br/>
The more objects added, the longer it will take.<br/>

If you try setting a asymmetric Z scaling factor to Symbol-2, the symbol inside of it will be scaled, but its insertion point will remain the same. When scaling symmetrically, the insertion point of the inner symbol is moved to the correct position (sett attached screenshot and video)

<br/>
It caught my attention that there&#39;s a small difference between those two commands:<br/>
<br/>
- &#39;Display out-of-date border&#39; available in the Document Preferences/ Display tab<br/>
versus<br/>
- &#39;Display Viewport Out-of-date borders&#39; available in the Quick Preferences.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-05-31-16-01-07-745.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
According to the corresponding help texts in the UI and user help, they should be the same option, applicable to both viewports AND site models.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please unify them, so that they are unambiguous and cover both: viewports and site models? Unless, the option in the Quick Preferences is limited only to viewports.<br/>
<br/>
Strings in question:<br/>
- Vectorworks &gt; 260 QuickPref Strings.vwstrings &gt; 38 &gt; Display Viewport Out-of-date Borders<br/>

I checked every option. It finished and issued a Migration Report, but none of my custom Plug-ins transferred. <br/>
<br/>
Wondering if this was a glitch, I opened a new blank file and ran the Migration Manager again. This time, VW 2024 crashed after I clicked the Migrate button.<br/>
<br/>
I saved the crash log, removed my User&#39;s Plug-ins folder, and relaunched the app. After running the Migration Manger a third time, still none of my custom plug-ins transferred. Is this expected behavior?<br/>

                Resource Conflict at Import from Resource Manager

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I am getting a resource conflict when I try to import from two different files into a blank document. The two files contain lighting devices from the same manufacturer but are different models. Each light has a C-clamp within the 3D geometry that needs to live with the symbol. The C-Clamp is a 3D only symbol that lives in the Symbol Parts folder of each file and is the same exact symbol. As there are 1,000s of lights that use this same clamp we decided to include the clamp in each file so that we are sure the clamp will be consistent across all files and not clutter the user&#39;s file with different versions of the same clamp. <br/>
<br/>
When importing from the ETC Source 4 file into a blank file there is no issue at all. When trying to import a light from the ETC Selador D60 file a resource conflict appears stating that the Light Acc C Clamp already exists and what do you want to do. From my understanding, this should not appear as the symbols should be identical. Is there a way to see if there is a difference between the symbol in each file?<br/>

There is a problem with synchronize camera in SP 4.version od VW, when we work on both programs together.

This is the same situation between VW2023 SP4. and LU2023, Lumion 12.5 Pro and Lumion 11 Pro.<br/>

To reproduce, edit the Annotations and move the Symbols.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the page-based symbol shows incorrectly (it only shows some of its geometry in the new location), until another redraw is done. This doesn&#39;t happen with the world-based symbol.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the &quot;Accelerate Graphics&quot; preference is enabled.<br/>

This may be related to VB-196019, which also involves symbol redraw inside GL annotations.<br/>

<br/>
After resizing the main window etc. I realized the resource manager was there, but its style change with total lack of shading made it blend in to the view bar so I did not notice it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the resource manager appearance is too easy to lose when collapsed with this change. A highlight-color shading would make it easier. I do not think the thin accent-color border is enough (and it does not always appear, it reverts to gray in depending on where current focus is).<br/>

                Windows: No Edit-Mode Redo of Text Style Dialog Alignment Changes etc.
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The undo/redo logic while a text object is in edit mode has a few quirks - often changes are coalesced into a single undo/redo event, which seems by design.<br/>
<br/>
However in this case, we get an undo event but after undo there is no redo available.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a wrapping multi-line text object with some text.<br/>
 # Enter edit mode in the text object with cursor active somewhere in the middle.<br/>
 # Open the Text-&gt;Text Style dialog and change horizontal alignment*; hit okay<br/>
 # Note the change has been applied<br/>
 # Still in edit mode, select Edit-&gt;Undo; note the horizontal alignment* reverts to earlier setting<br/>
 # Still in edit mode, select Edit-&gt;Redo<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the change applied at step 3. is re-applied<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the redo has no effect<br/>
<br/>
*this also occurs to changes of line spacing from the dialog during edit mode. Note that the issue does *not* occur with font style changes like bold, italic, font etc. - there, redo works properly in the same scenario.<br/>
<br/>
(I think this is probably not a regression, and may also happen on Mac, will update bug when I find out).

                Usability issue: Text Tool Rotated Mode seems broken if you forget to drag
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In normal mode for the text tool, you can activate the tool, click once in the drawing to get an insertion point, and start typing.<br/>
<br/>
If you put the tool in rotated mode to create a rotated text object, you are expected to drag an angle/endpoint - although, somewhat paradoxically, on Windows at least it doesn&#39;t actually honor this width, it snaps back to minimum width when you start typing (and will type past the point you dragged to). Note that this click-drag requirement is very different from most tools like rotated rects and lines which use a two-click approach with visual feedback as you move the cursor after the first click.<br/>
<br/>
The usability issue happens if a little time passes between using the tool and you forget you&#39;ve put it in rotated mode. If you single-click with the tool in this mode, you get what looks like a single selected-object handle but typing into it actually does nothing. It seems like the text object is broken.<br/>
<br/>
A better option would be to make rotated-text object creation a two-click operation like a line, with visual feedback as you move the cursor. So the first click will not create an unusable, abandoned object - instead it will start the two-click process of creating your rotated text object, just like rotated rectangle, line, etc.<br/>

<br/>
This file was created in Vectorworks 2022 (where it is not crashing) but when being opened in Vectorworks 2023, just by accessing the &quot;Plan as Proposed&quot; or &quot;Plan as Existing&quot; Design Layers, the file crashes Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
The crash happens on Vectorworks 2023 SP3 and SP4 on macOS 12.6 (Monterey)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried the file in Vectorworks 2023 SP4 on Windows 11 and the crash is not happening.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure of what exactly can be causing the crash, especially as it is happening only on Mac and not on Windows. Can you please have a look and give some advice? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.

                Back Reference values occasionally disappear during Save &amp; Commit

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi folks, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not been able to verify this yet but I&#39;m submitting it now because the particulars of this problem strongly suggest this is a software bug and is not simply a function of data corruption or a condition in the file. <br/>
<br/>
*We have had two seperate customers report that:* <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, when performing a &#39;Save &amp; Commit&#39; with a project sharing file, *_all_* the Back Reference values (only) inside the Drawing Labels disappear. They all have to be added back in one by one. <br/>
<br/>
*Associated Info:* <br/>
 * This problem does not happen every time. User Craig Greig at Andrew Sexton Architecture Ltd gave a rough indication of frequency: He uses &#39;Save &amp; Commit&#39; about 5 times a day and has restored lost Back References 3 times across 2 weeks. <br/>
 * He also said, &quot;As a test while writing this email I tried setting the back reference on one detail to ‘all objects linked to viewport’. During save and commit this message came up; &quot;This file is damaged. It will open with it as much detail as possible.&quot; The file still works ok. Just have this ongoing fault. We have cleared meta-data, created new share file but the fault keeps reoccurring.&quot; <br/>
 * Rhiannon Gray of Bourke Architects Ltd said, &quot;We have noticed the back-references tend to disappear more often when more than one person is working on the file and has made changes and then saved and committed. It occurs less frequently if only one person is working on the project share file.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve uploaded files from Rhiannon/Bourke Architects: <br/>
 * A video showing an occurrence. ([Here&#39;s a link to the original|https://www.dropbox.com/s/pg886m6c8t8l8zb/230502%20-%20Back%20references%20disappearing.mp4?dl=0]). <br/>
 * Their .vwxp (project) file and<br/>
 * A &#39;Save a Copy As&#39; .vwx file saved to the SLVP seen in the video. <br/>
<br/>
*If this is a known bug, please let me know.* <br/>
<br/>
If you need more info from these customers just let me know.

In the enclosed files and movie you will see the following:<br/>
<br/>
* Parasolid files imported into Vectorworks.<br/>
* Each one turned into a symbol.<br/>
* &#39;Waterups&#39; record attached to each when editing a symbol and with the geometry not selected. Name then entered for each symbol.<br/>
* Then these symbols are placed as they are in real life as components of the library object. This is then saved as a Blue Symbol so users can change the layout if need be.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
If a database worksheet is created and you search for things which have the &#39;WaterUps&#39; record attached it shows the name and the COUNT. This works fine. The preview of the &#39;Objects&#39; count at the bottom of the Edit Criteria dialogue says the correct number.<br/>
<br/>
If you edit the criteria and you add a second line of criteria no matter what it is, the count increases by two.<br/>
<br/>
If you click on the &#39;Symbols&#39; button the number goes to the thousands! This is the reason for the report.<br/>
<br/>
Although not in this report sometimes I have had empty rows with a count. If I right click to select the item sometimes it selects the groups that is the collection of symbols (even though no record is attached to the group, and several times as witnessed by others here it has selected the worksheet on the drawing! I have had to delete the second line of criteria to get back to just the counts.<br/>
<br/>
The screenshots are from another similar file but I send a more simple vwx file as it is easier to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter <br/>

I caught Vectorworks having this issue again.  This is a new show, but same issue.  I have imported my worksheets from a VWX file that I use as a pseudo-template file.  When I go to assign the database fields using the dropdowns it selects something different.  Ultimately, I’m able to get the correct info, but I have to enter it into the command line – at which point the command line and dropdown do not match.  I find this rather scary as this happens randomly and, also as randomly, sometimes restarting VW resolves the issue.  <br/>

Here is a link of the current drawing([https://www.dropbox.com/s/uo45nomddqyfm23/VW%20ISSUE.vwx?dl=0]), a screen-grab video showing the error and a couple screenshots of my parameters list.  As the video runs, you’ll notice my cursor highlighting certain things such as the difference between command line and the dropdown and the fact that, at one point, you can see in the dropdown that a few different options appear in ‘Bold’ text.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Steps to reproduce<br/>
1) Select the “Constrained Linear Dimension” tool and click “Constrained Chain mode” on the toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
2) Create a Constrained Chain dimension that has 2 measuring ponts at leaset.<br/>
<br/>
3) Select the &quot;Selection Tool&quot; and double-click the text on the left (or right) side of the dimension.<br/>
You are getting the text editing state with highlight.<br/>
<br/>
4) Double-click the other side text of the dimension.<br/>
You are getting the text editing state with highlight text again.<br/>
<br/>
5) Double-click the text on first selected of the dimension when you are in the text editing state.<br/>
<br/>
6) It will not be in the text editing state.<br/>
<br/>
*you can get the same result with simple steps. You do double-click twice on the &#39;Constrained Linear Dimension&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
* You can edit the text by deselecting the dimension and double-clicking it.<br/>
<br/>
* This problem does not occur when using the &quot;Text Tool&quot; and double-clicking the dimension to enter the text editing state.<br/>
<br/>
*As long as I tried, I see this problem also Vectorworks 2022 and Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>
* Another matter,  although the reproduction procedure is unknown,　I saw that the blue dimension line that is displayed when entering the editing state is displayed even if the dimension line is not selected.<br/>
If the blue dimension line appears, we have two restoration patterns.<br/>
1: one that does not disappear until the file is reopened or Vectorworks is closed.<br/>
2: the other that disappears immediately after being displayed.<br/>

<br/>
There seems to be two things that happen here: the selection (attached images with the prefix {*}select{*}) and something else that happens right after the selection (attached images with the prefix {*}right_after_select{*}). In the VS2022 profile, the selection starts at 1:00 and actually finishes at 6:11; the OIP shows &quot;8192 Dimensions&quot; at this point. However, as soon as I move the mouse at around 6:21, something else runs, and it keeps running forever. All the flame graphs and hot paths point to TObjectRuntimeCacheAccess, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually the culprit or the fact that it&#39;s being called too many times...

                Vectorworks gets into a state where all text objects have vertical size 0
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I have not yet been able to reproduce this, but this occurred in VW2023 SP5 fc.<br/>
<br/>
After running text acceptance tests - specifically, after testing creation of custom styles (and also after using the text tool in rotated mode) - Vectorworks got in a state where all new text objects would be created with vertical size zero.<br/>
<br/>
You could type into the object but barely see a section of the text. Then on enter and activation of the selection tool, the object shows three handles (instead of six) - and using them to resize vertically does not work, so the object is not really usable.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to then quit SP5 and run an installed release of VW2023 SP4, and the issue was there as well, indicating something in application settings or preferences.<br/>
<br/>
Running a 28.0.x build in the debugger showed that the InitTextNode() function was assigning a vertical spacing of 0 from dc.fpDG-&gt;gVerticalSpacingDefault. The debug build did assert downstream that this was an illegal value.<br/>
<br/>
After renaming the 2023 application support folder the issue went away, so it&#39;s definitely related to some corrupt saved application data.<br/>
<br/>
Attaching screenshots including stack traces from the debug problem, and a zip of the bad application data folder.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt this is a regression but won&#39;t know until it can be reproduced reliably.

The enclosed Vectorworks file was converted in the VCS to a vgx file. when opened in Nomad v12.3.1 the app crashes.<br/>
When vgx were created previously they opened fine. I can&#39;t recall but I don&#39;t think there has been any new geometry added. The only thing was to reduce the intensity of two different Renderworks light symbols used in the drawing (Hi Bay and Down light Stadium) otherwise I can&#39;t think of anything that has changed.<br/>
If the vgx file is added to a VCS presentation board, when the pin is clicked on, it loads but fails to finish loading and basically has crashed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
[Question] Is it possible to make any chance of the following communication settings during Vectorworks activation when the server system could not chenge by corporate internal control code with Kerberos authentication.<br/>
<br/>
* Disable proxy authentication (Proxy-Authorization: no header is given)<br/>
* Support Kerberos authentication (with Proxy-Authorization: Negotiate header added)<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
The details of network situation of customer are not clear for us.<br/>
However it have possible to make any chance to following customer&#39;s authentication system.<br/>
<br/>
* The network situation of customer, the proxy server does not support Basic authentication.<br/>
So server returns a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) to Vectorworks and requests Kerberos authentication.<br/>
However Vectorworks send back the headers on subsequent requests are the same &quot;Proxy-authentication: Basic&quot; header to proxy server.<br/>
The proxy server returns error as a result.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve tried this with various objects (speakers, lighting devices, drop points) and it&#39;s always the same. If I create a number of objects say 4 Speakers, I select them, and use Align/Distribute to align vertical centres and distributes horizontal spacing - that gives me an nice row of 4 speakers evenly spaced. If I want to increase the spacing I can move one of the end ones further out and redo align/distribute.<br/>
<br/>
But what if I want to reduce the spacing? Here&#39;s what I tried: select the speakers and group them, use the reshape handles of the group to reduce the horizontal size. Nothing happens. Editing the width of the group in the OIP also does nothing.<br/>
<br/>
If I do the same thing with 4 loci the space between them shrinks - what I&#39;d expect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually at a loss for a way to reduce spacing. If there isn&#39;t a way I think that&#39;s a bug. I have a suspicion that this wasn&#39;t always the case (regression or &quot;improvement&quot;?).

The Vectorworks Cloud Services app never opened on start up even though I had that setting checked in the Settings. I am using version 12.4.2541.<br/>
<br/>
I deleted the &#39;vectorworks-cloud-services&#39; folder in the Application Support along with two older beta folders and restarted. It still didn&#39;t launch.<br/>
<br/>
The only way I can get it to launch at start up is to manually add it to my log in items on my Mac log in account.<br/>
<br/>
It has been like this for several versions - maybe back to v2022 and I didn&#39;t report because I thought it must be because I install so many versions and delete user accounts etc but then so do others hence this belated report now.<br/>
<br/>

                T02250 - New Text Vertical Alignment icons are incorrect
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The new View Bar interface adds a Text section with new buttons that control the Vertical Alignment of the Text object.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these icons being a bit too detailed and difficult to decipher, the imagery in some of them is inherently {_}incorrect{_}. The two horizontal lines are meaningless to most of the actual settings, and they are incorrectly used for some of the arrow positions.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when it comes to the &quot;Top Baseline&quot; and &quot;Bottom Baseline&quot; options, the word &quot;baseline&quot; in +both+ cases refers to the line upon which most letters sit ({*}meaning the current &quot;Top Baseline&quot; icon is particularly erroneous because it points to the mean line instead of a baseline{*}). The distinction between the &quot;Top Baseline&quot; and &quot;Bottom Baseline&quot; options only matters in regards to multi-line text objects, wherein the anchor gets placed either on the baseline of the first line, or the baseline of the last line. It has nothing to do with the x-height, mean line, or ascender line. For single-line text, &quot;Top Baseline&quot; and &quot;Bottom Baseline&quot; are functionally identical (see below).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also important to remember that the Vertical Alignment setting determines the anchor point for the {+}overall text object{+}, i.e. &quot;Top,&quot; &quot;Middle,&quot; and &quot;Bottom&quot; refer to the bounding box of the Text Object, not individual characters in a line. This is another reason why including the baseline and mean line in all of the icons is misleading.<br/>
<br/>
For clarity, here&#39;s a visual breakdown which indicates where the anchor gets placed for each of the 5 various Vertical Alignments: <br/>
<br/>
!TextAnchors.png|width=464,height=320!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this helps illustrate why the icons aren&#39;t quite right. Here are two new proposals which attempt to balance clarity vs functionality:<br/>
<br/>
!VerticalAlignment_AEB_opt1.png|width=472,height=116!<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
!VerticalAlignment_AEB_opt2.png|width=472,height=116!<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the current:<br/>
<br/>
!VerticalAlignment0.png|width=472,height=116!<br/>
<br/>
At then of the day, the second and third icons are the most egregious, and _none_ of them should include the mean line. But the main point is that ideally the icons would be reconsidered holistically, and would make sense in both single-line and multi-line contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

I went to purge the file and one of the special formats listed is the Viewport format. This seems odd to me as I still have sheet layer viewports in the file. One of the layers I deleted contained the only design layer viewport in the file, so if this format is specific to design layer viewports it would make sense, although the naming of &quot;Viewport&quot; format would not be specific enough. I did not purge the viewport format from the file. Another interesting thing, when I ran the purge command the view of the file switched from the active design layer to the last sheet layer in the file. Once I canceled out of the purge, the view returned to active design layer. When I performed the purge and simply excluded the viewport format, the file stayed on the final sheet layer.

<br/>
This simple piece of code<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
SWallSymbolBreak  brk;<br/>
 if (wall.FindBreak(pio_in_wall,brk))  {    <br/>
                        brk.offset+=off_break;                           <br/>
                        wall.SetBreak(brk);<br/>
  } // **<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
should obviously do the trick, but in reality the break was not moved and the OIP said &quot;2 windows in wall&quot; (before that, it was just one, but now there were two windows at the same position).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I did not change anything in the SWallSymbolBreak variable except for the offset so the offset should be the only thing that changes in the drawing. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to create a new window.<br/>

<br/>
Just had a user not able to copy and paste text out of Vectorworks 2023 Landmark on Windows 10 Pro. They&#39;re able to paste text into Vectorworks in a text box but when it comes to copying the text while editing (blue highlight box on the text box), the copy function does not appear to work, there&#39;s nothing in the clipboard either. The file works fine on other machines.<br/>
<br/>
User was told to update to SP4, user folder was also reset but the issue still persisted.<br/>
<br/>
They are able to copy the text box as a whole and paste it as an image but just not as text.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a dxdiag of the machine she was on and the file we tested it on. We also looked if it happened on a blank file and it did the same thing.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Identical names are given in &quot;Manage Filters...&quot; in Organizer classes and layers.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Open the Organization.<br/>
2) In the Class (or Layer) tab, click the &quot;Manage Filters...&quot; button in the Class (or Layer) tab.<br/>
3) Class Filter Manager &gt; Class Filters &gt; select any filter.<br/>
Click the &quot;Duplicate&quot; button.<br/>
4) Click the &quot;Rename...&quot; button for the duplicated filter.<br/>
5) Change the name to the same name as the filter name that already exists and click the &quot;OK&quot; button.<br/>
6) Filters with the same name are created.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
However, when I try to rename a duplicate filter from the edit button, I get a warning and cannot rename it to the same name.<br/>
<br/>

Then run the Edit &gt; Previous Selection command. The other object is selected as expected but the mesh object is also still selected.<br/>
<br/>
This was found while looking into a different Previous Selection issue. Some investigation showed that it is happening because dragging over the mesh enables its selection flag (and dragging back off the mesh so that the drag does not contain the mesh does not disable it). The selection state of each object is stored for Previous Selection only when the drag is released and thus it includes the mesh object.

<br/>
It&#39;s a relatively minor annoyance but it should be fixed at some point.

<br/>
In the attached Vectorworks document we have a Polyline with a Line Type, the Line Type does not follow the Polyline shape as wanted. Plus, while in the Design Layer we can see that the Line Type shape switches depending on zoom, while in the Viewport has displays always the same shape (which is not correct  on the corners).

<br/>
For some reason, when I assign a channel number on a lighting device that is using a label legend that contains a container, the style of the container is being broken on the fill and line color. When I delete the number from the channel field, the fill and line color come back to the style of the container. Very odd.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
The &quot;CANCEL UPLOAD&quot; button in Vectorworks Cloud Service is not working.<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Create two arbitrary files. Name the files &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively.<br/>
<br/>
2) Upload file &quot;A&quot; on Vectorworks Cloud Service.<br/>
<br/>
3）Drag and drop the file &quot; A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to Vectorworks Cloud Service after any editing to file &quot;A&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4) Dialog&quot;WARNING will appear after click &quot;CANCEL UPLOAD&quot; button.<br/>
&quot;File(s) with the same name already exist in your folder. Click Continue to overwrite. The previous file(s) will be available from their version history.&quot;<br/>
Click &quot;CANCEL UPLOAD&quot; and progress message is displayd &quot;Uploading 1 file....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5) However the &quot;A&quot; file was overwritten in spite of Cancel select.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached &quot;13139.jpg&quot;. <br/>

The &quot;Nested Symbol&quot; has a front 2D component, and is placed in the &quot;Enclosing Symbol&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When rendered in Hidden Line, both symbols display the front component, as expected. However, when editing Enclosing Symbol, the front component does not show the nested 2D component. The symbols does not appear to have a Front component if no further objects are added.

<br/>
Without holding any modifier keys, the default rectangular marquee selection should select ONLY objects that are completely encompassed within the marquee. If the marquee only partially goes over an object, that object should not be selected.<br/>
<br/>
What often happens is that these rules aren&#39;t followed in Perspective projection: objects that are only partially marqueed over become selected. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching a file where this bug happens reliably. See the attached recording in which the first marquee works correctly, then the second and third attempts are incorrect. The 3D figure should not have become selected since only a portion of that Symbol was marqueed.

This happens in every new document that is created. Once the object is placed, previews will show fine

                File locking fails with cloud storage services
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      File locking does not work as expected with cloud storage services. If you open a file, a .lck file is created. This happens both on our local NAS file server, as well as on various cloud storage services and . lck the file, which is only 1 KB in size, is synchronized lightning fast to all connected devices.<br/>
<br/>
1. For a file opened from our local NAS file server, it works correctly and another user trying to open an already opened .vwx file is notified that the file has been opened by another user and offered to open a copy.<br/>
<br/>
2. For a file opened from a shared cloud storage resource, a .lck file is created, but despite this, another user can open the same .vwx file without receiving any notice that the file is already in use. This makes it impossible to use cloud storage for collaboration with VW!<br/>
<br/>
Most cloud services cannot offer file locking at operating system level like a local NAS, so the lock file is probably the only option to mark the file as occupied.<br/>
<br/>
I tried opening a VW file on my computer and asked my colleague to open the same file on his computer with the following results:<br/>
1. Local NAS: The file locking works. The colleague cannot open the file and is offered to open a copy. This is the expected behaviour.<br/>
2. Pcloud: File locking does not work. The colleague can open the file. When we both save our opened files, two file versions appear: One with the original name &quot;filename.vwx&quot; and one with the extension &quot;filename (conflicted).vwx&quot;. This is not acceptable!<br/>
3. LucidLink: File locking does not work. The colleague can open the file. When we save, the file is replaced with the last saved version, i.e. the system does not detect that the file is open at all, even though a .lck file has been created in the folder. This is not acceptable!<br/>
<br/>
For me, this problem was known for pCloud, so I decided to test LucidLink. They claim that their service has file locking! It was therefore surprising that the file locking did not work with VW. When, we tried the same test with an .odt file in LibreOffice, the file locking worked perfectly in all three cases. Then we did another test with a dwg file in Bricscad and the file was correctly locked on the local NAS server and in LucidLink. However, in pCloud both could open the same file without a note and after saving there were two differnet versions of the file created again.<br/>
<br/>
Pcloud claims to handle conflicts by creating copies (conflict marked file versions) so that nothing is lost, but says nothing about file locking. LucidLink clarifies that they have file locking, but don&#39;t seem to resolve the conflict by creating conflict copies, so versions are lost and replaced with the last saved one.<br/>
<br/>
It feels as if VW does not consider the .lck file at all, and the locking is done/served by the operating system in the NAS server (Asustor AS4004T) . Cloud file sync requires other lock indicators which worked with LucidLink for both LibreOffice and Bricscad, but surprisingly not for VW. LibreOffice seems to handle all cases and probably also checks mainly against the .lck file whis is fine in the case.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We want to be able to work with cloud services and have been attracted to the service offered by LucidLink, which in theory should be able to replace our local NAS (they call it cloud NAS). To get away from the limitations that a local NAS brings when work needs to be done outside the office, it is important that VW can handle work over file sharing services, which I feel is not fully possible today.<br/>

wall turns black when inserting objects.<br/>
See testfile and my video.<br/>
The objects are german window and doors.<br/>
But if I use our german windows and doors in an us version then they are only symbols and not really plug-ins any more.<br/>
Wall and objects are story bounded.<br/>
If I reproduce that without story bounding it seems not to happen.<br/>
By the way the black color comes from the wall attributes. It seems to switch from components attributes to wall attributes.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
* In Vectorworks2022, the line attribute set in the attribute class is applied to Profile Line.<br/>
<br/>
* Profile Line will not be applied when Vectorworks2022 files are opened and updated in Vectorworks2023.<br/>
By exporting the Vectorworks2023 file to Vectorworks2022, opening it, and updating it, it will be displayed normally.<br/>

Perhaps this needs to be a preference that can be set via the SDK because not each plug-in might need this?<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not only our plug-in that suffers from it, the Window and Door tool do too (see screenshot).

The option &quot;Text Scale&quot; of the Viewport does nothing when printed if the Text is on a 3D plane. It look okay on screen, it is not when printed.<br/>

I successfully had a result.obj and result.usdz and result.mtl files at the root level of my VCS folder.<br/>
<br/>
Then via Nomad I ran the photos to 3D and got them processed. I note that all three files were overwritten without my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
This might be more of a VE but it would be great to be prompted to name the project or a warning that a file with that name exists and then to have the chance to rename. I thought I had chosen a folder for the photos to go into but I obviously didn&#39;t do it correctly.<br/>

<br/>
When using an iPhone and &#39;Photos to 3D&#39; an OBJ file is created that allows users to import as a mesh with textures into Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
If the drawing file is in millimetres, the import dialogue asks you to match the same. However if I choose millimetres then the object comes in 1000 times too small. You need to choose metres instead even though the &#39;model space&#39; units as described in the dialogue should be millimetres.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is something that [~bbeaumont3] and I have observed about the metric conversion of some objects in Vectorworks. I enclose the WAD VB I put in about STL files being 1000 the wrong size. Last week we had someone exporting a 3DS file and that was 1000 times the wrong size and now this import of an OBJ file is 1000 times the wrong size upon import.<br/>

<br/>
Command not enabled: ROTATE<br/>
Steps to enable:<br/>
1) Click &quot;Shutdown&quot; from the menu on the left side of the Web Interface.<br/>
2) Click the &quot;SHUT DOWN SERVER&quot; displayed next to shut down the ISV server.<br/>
3) Click &quot;Reread/Restart Servers&quot; from the left menu of the Web Interface.<br/>
4) On the next screen, click &quot;REREAD/RESTART&quot; to start the ISV server.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think most commands, such as the Exclude command, are enabled just by executing &quot;Reread/Restart Servers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I have a question.<br/>
Is it by spec that the server needs to be shut down and started up like this to enable the ROTATE command? Or is it a bug?<br/>
If it is a spec, we have the following improvement requests for help documentation.<br/>
<br/>
-Please add a note about commands that require such server shutdown and startup in the ISV and RLM options.<br/>
-In &quot;Specifying server options&quot; where options are described, please add that Reread/Restart is required for the option to take effect, and that depending on the command, the server must be shut down and started.<br/>

<br/>
I have a company that is complaining about performance in moving objects. In 2017 version they seem to find the file attached to work way better compared to 2023 or 2022. <br/>
<br/>
Would there be any explanation on why that would be happening? I am aware that the slowness that they get is very minor, but user is so upset about it that they are threatening to move to Autocad as they don&#39;t find any slowness there. Now i explained that the workflows used are outdated and that they are not following our recommendations in using layers and switching layer visibility settings to hide some of the information that is not necessary for the actions that they do but their come back is just - 2017 Vectorworks on a 2015 mac works faster than the same setup on 2022 or 2023 M1 Max new mac. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Il attach 2 videos for comparison and yes customer showed me this slowness as the worst thing and they are just pushing to have same exact performance as 2017.

After duplicating two Design Layers, they do not appears in the expected / wanted order. That happens only when after we duplicate the two design layers AND switch to a different file and back. Like it is shown in the attached video.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce this problem, create a new file like its shown in the video and replicate the same shown steps.

<br/>
The light at the top has a 40° spread angle and a 10° beam angle. This should control the angle falloff of the beam. Generally, the beam angle is defined at the point where the light is 50% of the center brightness and the field angle is where the light is 90% of the center brightness. As below that is fairly imperceptible to the eye, we can assume that the edge of the beam is at the spread angle.<br/>
<br/>
Both Shaded and RW show a taper from center to beam to spread, and a hard edge when spread = beam. The curve which the taper follows is different, however.<br/>
<br/>
Redshift shows an abrupt step at the beam angle, and the spread angle tapers at the edges regardless of the distance from the beam. When beam and spread are the same, the field is not flat at all, and the overall brightness is significantly reduced.

I would suggest that this limitation could appear somewhere (or in the pop-up warning or in the Export Settings Dialog, as example).

1)Open the attached file. (Sample230127.vwx)<br/>
 A data tag defining &quot;ROUNDOWN&quot; is placed in the file.<br/>
(At this point, it seems that the second decimal place is also displayed.)<br/>
2)Go to  &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Document Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Units...&quot; and click it.<br/>
 Check the Decimal Precison is set to &quot;.01&quot;.<br/>
3)Close the &quot;Units&quot; dialog.<br/>
4)Select the data tag and click &quot;Settings...&quot; of OIP.<br/>
5)Without changing anything, click the &quot;OK&quot; button in the &quot;Data tag Settings&quot; dialog.<br/>
6)Check the data tag,everything after the second decimalplace is not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
*It looks like to be affected by &quot;Decimal Precison&quot; of &quot;Length&quot; in the &quot;File menu &gt; &quot;Document Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Units...&quot; dialog.<br/>
*When the sample file is opened with Vectorworks 2022,regardless of the &quot;Decimal Precison&quot; of &quot;Length&quot;,the second decimal place is also displayed.<br/>

- Create a simple drawing<br/>

- On the Attribute Value, change Fill to Solid<br/>
- Change the Color to something else. <br/>
<br/>
Note the lag/glitch on Palette to show all the colors. This also happens on the Pen Color Palette. <br/>
<br/>
This only happens on Windows 11 and it is not constant. But it is almost every time. Changing Fill or Pen to something else and then coming back to solid and selecting a Color seems to retrigger the issue. <br/>

It is very annoying that this functionality has been lost.<br/>
See the attached test file and two movies.<br/>
Select the floor object and the slab object. Some objects are impossible to align in 3D now using the 3D Align/Distribute tool. In the first movie I attempt to align a slab and floor object. After running 3D Align,  the floor goes down to -2194&#39;7 1/4&quot; below the roof plan layer.<br/>
In the second movie, I attempt to align the slab object with a 3D locus point. Upon running 3D align, the slab object is sent to 2195&#39;5 3/8&quot; above the roof layer.<br/>
<br/>
I do all my work in 3D and expect to be able to use the tools reliably. There is no work around for this lack of functionality. I need to draw my work accurately and 3D align used to be the way to ensure accurate placement of objects relative to each other.<br/>
<br/>
What is supposed to happen:<br/>
Select objects to align in 3D, go to Modify/Align/Align-Distribute 3D;<br/>
Decide which axis and direction to align and press OK, the objects align in 3D as specified.<br/>

- Outlet tool<br/>
- Drip Outlet tool<br/>
- Pipe tool<br/>
- Valve tool<br/>
- Point of Connection tool<br/>
- System Component tool<br/>
<br/>
In a Project Sharing environment, this can cause two object checkout dialogs to appear immediately following each other when adding an object from one of these tools to an irrigation system.  It seems like the creation of these objects should be undoable with one undo command usage, which would also prevent two object checkout dialogs in a Project Sharing environment.

Complex line type in the source document in the target document the plan is referenced. Then a layout is made and this layout is rotated. The complex line types are not rotated. You can see it only in the PDF, printout etc. and if you take out the graphic acceleration.<br/>

Double click on the Viewport WP Schnitt A Fund-2<br/>

Now we have a Section Viewport. Update this Section Viewport and exit to go to the original Viewport. Now not all objects are being displayed in the Viewport. We expect that the Viewport displays all the objects seen in the Section Viewport, which is not the case after updating the Section Viewport.<br/>

This brings the problem, that the Customer wants to export the Sheet Layer 24 to PDF, hoping to have all the objects seen in the Section Viewport, but that does not happen.

1) create a worksheet<br/>
2) write *AA* in the cell {_}A1{_}, write =IF({_}A1{_}=AA;1;0) in _A2_<br/>
--&gt; {_}A2{_}&#39;s result will be {*}1{*}.<br/>
If _A1_ is not *AA* {_}A2{_}&#39;s result will be {*}0{*}. ** <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately these two fields won&#39;t show the same results once exported into Excel. There the formula in A2 has to be written like this: =IF(A1=&quot;AA&quot;;1;0) for it to work.<br/>

Viewport is not visible. I think the problem is the georeference. In VW2022 it works.<br/>

-Open the atttached file, make sure you update the reference through the<br/>

-Change to Viewport Tab in the Navigation Tab.<br/>
-Activate the Viewport that is not updated,  once the viewport is <br/>
  activated, go to the Object Info Palette and Update the viewport.<br/>
-Once the Viewport is updated, go back to the Navigation Palette and activate a different<br/>
 viewport (right clicking, context menu)that is Not updated.<br/>
-Right click again on the recently selected viewport, notice the &quot;Update&quot; command is<br/>
  grayed out, even though the viewport needs updating.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a video capture showing this behavior.<br/>
