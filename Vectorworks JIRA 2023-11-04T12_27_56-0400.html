<br/>
In all this cases, it will be difficult to edit the linked objects. It will need additional clicks and the user needs to know whether to change class or layer visibilities.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if there would be an option to select the linked object through the Data Tag. This option could be provided here:<br/>
 * Button in OIP<br/>
 * Context menu with right-click on Data Tag<br/>
 * Double-Click dialog of Data Tag<br/>
<br/>
It could work similar to the worksheet context menu on the row of objects in reports called &quot;Select item&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This would work on design layers, sheet layers and also in annotations of viewports.<br/>
<br/>
The same wish has already been reported for Data Tags with Spaces: VE-103776<br/>
<br/>
But the solution couldn&#39;t be limited to the Space only. All tagged objects would have a big benefit from that solution.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, we could also think about having a solution to edit Styles of linked objects directly too. But this needs further discussion.<br/>

I&#39;ve linked to a few bugs/enhancements related to this issue and will include a brief summary and additional issues here.<br/>
 * https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-105038 -Fillets are inconsistent, see comments.<br/>
 * https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-105037 - Arc issues, see comments<br/>
 * https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-199393 - Trimming Problems<br/>
 * Bezier Curve Discussion - [https://vectorworks.slack.com/archives/CCL8DP7FZ/p1695916516332119]<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Bezier curves and NURBS, I&#39;m unfamiliar with architecture, but when planning in 2D many Landscape Architects are looking for very simple polylines. Bezier curves and conversion to NURBS (this seems to happen often when creating something like a hardscape from a shape), causes unnecessary complication. The abilty to by default prevent creation of Bezier curves or conversion to NURBS unless absolutely necessary would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Missing Tool modes:<br/>
 * Tan, Tan, Rad for defining CIRCLEs and ARCs would greatly speed up drafting of curvilinear elements.<br/>
 * The ability to define an ellipse by one axis (centerline) and 1/2 of its second axis would eliminate several steps in some scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll continue to comment with additional tweaks as I come across them.

Anyway, when the user places the symbol between the centerline and the truss chord, VW should offset the correct distant to center the Lighting Device (clamp) on the truss chord it&#39;s closest too. It&#39;s a regression because this functionally existed prior 2021 or 2022.

It should be the exact width of the cabinet width (no reveals) and the front of it should be at the cabinet depth, like it is a solid face frame. There shouldn&#39;t be a box or anything behind it. This is true no matter what the frame type is, framed or frameless, inset or overlay. Essentially, filler should look like a frame extension that is detached from the cabinet.

<br/>
In my opinion, when two the same kind of profiles, being at the same height, are joined, there should be no separation line between them. That line suggest elevation of both profiles is different or there&#39;s a step (downcast or upcast) between its top surfaces (different profile heights). At least, there should be possibility of decision if that line should or shlould not be visible.

One issue i run into when using it is that the tabs do not have a dedicated order. It depends on the order of turning the auto hide function on or off and this is to random. You loose track where the menu`s are.<br/>

wishes:<br/>

AND after a focus point has been created, and then I want to alter the layout a bit, I need a way to Lock the previous focus, so that seats don&#39;t shift angles if I chop off the end of the layout or remove a couple of sets to create a handicap space , etc.

in the database we have to write this as<br/>
<br/>
XLR3M  3  L  INPUT      IN<br/>
RCA       1   L  INPUT 4  IN<br/>
RCA       1   L  INPUT 5  IN<br/>
RCA       1   L  INPUT 6  IN<br/>
RCA       1   L  INPUT 7  IN<br/>
<br/>
now it would be much cooler if we could enter this as say<br/>
<br/>
XLR3M  3  L  INPUT      IN<br/>
RCA       4   L  INPUT [4]  IN<br/>
<br/>
so that the 4 connectors are in a single line in the database.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to suggestions for the best way to encode this behaviour in the name prefix string.

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
There is a BUG (or limitation) with &quot;Saved Views&quot; in combination with<br/>
&quot;Multiple View Panes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In my attached test file (VW 2024 Beta2), I have two &quot;View Panes&quot; open.<br/>
<br/>
The left pane is defined to: &quot;Top/Plan&quot; + &quot;2D Plan&quot; + Wireframe,<br/>
<br/>
The right pane is defined to: Isometric + Perspective + Shaded.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem is, that the &quot;Saved View&quot; doesn&#39;t save the different settings<br/>
from the different &quot;View Panes&quot; independently.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Saved View&quot; can only save the setting for the current active &quot;View Pane&quot;,<br/>
not for multiple panes and can overwrite the settings of the other panes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The in my test file included &quot;Saved View&quot;  = &quot;Test View 1&quot;<br/>
was saved with Perspective + Shaded.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you load the &quot;Saved View&quot;, it depends on which pane you have active at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you load the Saved View and you have the right pane (Perspective + Shaded) active = everything is okay, the left pane does not lost its settings (Top/Plan + WIreframe).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you load the Saved View and you have the left pane (Top/Plan + Wireframe) active,<br/>
then these settings will be overwritten with Perspective + Shaded.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I find this behavior enjoying and would like to have this behavior improved.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope the explanation was not too complicated?<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>
Tobi

The new Equipment Summary Key however seems to be left-aligning all the symbols and the results are far from visually appealing and look pretty unprofessional.<br/>
<br/>
That said when I think through functionality and desired results I can see where having the option to left-align would be handy. As an example, for the most part I would want all my lighting, hoist, projector, and LED tile symbols center-aligned, but with items like truss, pipe, and decks I would want them to be all left-aligned. To that end it would be great if the ESK dialog had an &quot;Align To&quot; option that allow users to set how the graphic aligns in the symbol column. Having granular alignment control would be especially helpful for things like strip lights that you might want left-aligned despite having the rest of the instruments center-aligned.

[ CPreen comment:<br/>
<br/>
What Simon is getting at here is important. The icons we have  for switching views may not be obvious to everyone. We need some way for new users to get on-boarded fast from help within the app. How exactly this issue is solved is a matter for our UI/UX designer.<br/>
<br/>
Since our goal is to facilitate adoption I&#39;m going to schedule this for 29.0.0 if possible. I want to remove these kind of obstacles. ]

                ConnectCAD: Connector Panels need a 3rd mode

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      These two icons are misleading. What they actually signify is which side of the schematic connector is the front of the panel.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-06-22-13-30-29-125.png|width=376,height=173!<br/>
<br/>
In fact there seem  to be 3 cases:<br/>
 # bare-ends on the left  : cable connector on right<br/>
 # cable connector on left : bare-ends on the right<br/>
 # cable connector on left : cable connector on right<br/>
<br/>
Some chassis connectors are feed-thru&#39;s e.g. BNC or RJ45, or fiber-optic barrels. In these cases (#3) there is a cable connector on the cable coming into the back side of the panel.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the icons being this way is that we hijacked the Socket.Type parameter plus the Socket.Orientation = X to give us a bi-directional socket. But now that we have outgrown Vectorscript it is time we did this properly.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s what I think the *real* truth table is:<br/>
<br/>
Socket.Type is IN, IO, or OUT depending on the *use* of the socket. The default should be IO because a passive connector on a panel doesn&#39;t care how it is used.<br/>
<br/>
Socket.Orientation should be extended to cover the 3 cases above, so we have:<br/>
 # L - normal left-facing socket<br/>
 # R - normal right-facing socket<br/>
 # T - normal up-facing socket<br/>
 # B - normal down-facing socket<br/>
 # X - bi-directional socket: bare-ends L  : cable connector R<br/>
 # Y - bi-directional socket: cable connector L : bare-ends R<br/>
 # Z - bi-directional socket: cable connector L : cable connector R<br/>
<br/>
Orientation Z works fine if it&#39;s the *same* cable connector on both sides. I think that is a reasonable simplifying assumption. In the case where the front and backside connectors are different then the user will have to create a custom device.<br/>
<br/>
*Important note to think about here is forward translation. We should probably implement this on a major version boundary unless minor version changes can be detected.*<br/>
<br/>
[~smonninghoff]  FYI might need some icons here...

{color:#ff8b00}Solution:{color}- A single instance of code should do the enabled state updates for both dialog and shape pane.<br/>
 - Style support and Selection support (for multiple selection) should still be correctly applied.<br/>
 - Idea: add by-instance/by-style/by-catalog data in Selection support. Use both determination state AND instance/style/catalalog data to set enabled state.

To this end we need to display an alert with the following text with the Don&#39;t Show Again option.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The product information provided in the Device Builder has been created by Vectorworks, Inc and is based on manufacturers&#39; publicly available product data, CAD/BIM models, and/or specifications that can be found in any of the following sources: product websites, product specifications, product documentation/brochures, product photographs or imagery. In most cases the information was not developed in partnership, or with permission from the manufacturer. Vectorworks, Inc has compiled this information solely for the purpose of assisting industry professionals in creating devices. This information is not meant as a complete specification or ordering system nor is it guaranteed to be free of errors or omissions.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks, Inc. implies no relation with any manufacturer. All information is subject to change by the manufacturer. We strongly recommend checking the product information on the each manufacturer&#39;s web site for complete product options, installation options and other technical specific data as information is subject to change without notice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the ideal logic would be to trigger the alert on first use of either of the popups Category: and Make/Model.<br/>
<br/>
If the user just exits with OK hide the alert for the rest of the session but show again in the next session. If the user checks the Don&#39;t Show Again button the alert is not shown at all. If the user has unchecked the Enable Database tool pref. then the alert is not shown, however if the user subsequently enables the database again then the Don&#39;t Show Again status should be reset so that the user sees the alert at least once.<br/>

                T02250 - Use consistent language in Quick Prefs (Show vs Display, Use vs Enable)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      !Display-vs-Show.png|width=472,height=318!<br/>
<br/>
Currently in the list of Quick Preferences, there are some that use the term &quot;Display&quot; and some that use the term &quot;Show.&quot; As far as I can tell, there&#39;s no taxonomical difference between the two terms. Because the Quick Prefs are listed {*}alphabetically{*}, it would be useful to choose one of the two terms so that it&#39;s easier and faster to navigate to the desired preference.<br/>
<br/>
With the way it is currently, whenever I want to find a particular setting I always find myself struggling to remember which word was used. For example, was it &quot;Show Broken Link Indicators&quot; or &quot;Display Broken Link Indicators&quot;? I shouldn&#39;t need to contemplate this.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like these settings could use one term or the other. &quot;Show&quot; seems to be more common so perhaps go with that.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, &quot;Show Clip Cube&quot; doesn&#39;t categorically fit in the &quot;Show&quot; preferences since it&#39;s not just showing and hiding the display of something like a glyph or tooltip, rather it&#39;s functionally enabling &amp; disabling the Clip Cube which can interact directly with geometry. I would suggest simply renaming it &quot;Clip Cube&quot; since most users would look for the word &quot;Clip&quot; alphabetically when searching for this setting. (It would also then match the command in the View menu).<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I suggest removing the word &quot;Enable&quot; from &quot;Enable Smart Options Display&quot; and removing the word &quot;Use&quot; from &quot;Use Multiple View Panes.&quot; That way these preferences would be alphabetically in the list where a user would first look, and they would match other on/off buttons which don&#39;t use a verb prefix.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Quick Prefs GUI is already being modified, now would be the time to make these changes so it can all get rolled out at once. These simple adjustments would make it faster to locate each setting and make the nomenclature more consistent.

Having previewed the animation you want to edit the path. The desired action would be to go to a top view and just drag a vertex to a new location. <br/>

Currently you have to juggle backwards and forwards between the X and Y constraints individually, or, with the working plane restraint, drag it to where you want it to be, whereupon it will immediately lose it&#39;s z value and snap to the working plane, and you have to re-enter it&#39;s correct value.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true for the other orthogonal views.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a situation where I would want the program to behave in this way.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this may be treated as a bug, but when I try to operate with settings of previously created cabinet and try to change door type, its orientation sometimes changes.<br/>
<br/>
In attached sample, I have a cabinet with doors as a front (&#39;Drzwi&#39;) with hinges localized on the right side (see the object on the left side of the screen). When I change the front type to any other - let&#39;s say &#39;Drzwi ukł. piętrowy&#39;, the orientation of the doors (localization of hinges) autmoaticaly changes to opposite and instead of the right doors I get mirrored version with doors opening to the left side (see the highlighted object on the right side of the screen).<br/>
<br/>
What is interesting, any further change in this area doesn&#39;t change door orientation - for instance, if I decide to bring back the front doors type set to &#39;Drzwi&#39;, they will stay as the left one.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it&#39;s not a propper functionality.

Deadhang bridles are not correctly created by the bridle tool. <br/>
A deadhang bridle should only have a single downleg, but currently they are created in Spotlight with an upper leg, apex and downleg which causes a number of problems<br/>
 * inaccurate part calculation, with extra shackles and uneeded/wanted short steels<br/>
 * difficulty in inserting deadhang bridles especially as drops between trusses as the user has to constantly play with the apex height and downleg length settings to get a correctly drawn bridle<br/>
<br/>
The deadhang bridle should only have a single downleg and basket with no upper leg. If it has to have an apex for engingeering reasons this should be defined as the connection point between the basket and downleg.

Note that the items in the left-to-right legend can be aligned in columns using the new &quot;Align in Column&quot; option, but the items in the top-to-bottom legend can&#39;t be aligned in rows.<br/>
<br/>
Based on files I&#39;ve seen from users, it&#39;s pretty common for them to use the top-to-bottom arrangement where row alignment would be needed.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re able to add this it might make sense to rename the new option to &quot;Align in Row/Column&quot;, and then use the legend&#39;s existing &quot;Arrange Layout By:&quot; parameter (which is either &quot;Row&quot; or &quot;Column&quot;) to determine whether column or row alignment should be applied.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
greetings. I wish you all a Happy New Year.<br/>
I&#39;m totally excited for what you have to offer for us in VW in the year 2023.<br/>
<br/>
/ / / <br/>
<br/>
I think we do need some more useful and easy to use formulas for Worksheets.<br/>
My top wishes are (same syntax as MS Excel):<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
=SumIF(range; search criteria; sum range)<br/>
<br/>
e.g. =SumIF(A2; &#39;Apartment Unit 1&#39;; B2)<br/>
Sum (areas, lengths, …) of all listed objects in B2, which<br/>
are set as &quot;Apartment Unit 1&quot; in A2.  <br/>
<br/>
It must be possible to easy search inside database subrows!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
=CountIF(range; search criteria)<br/>
e.g. =CountIF(A2; &quot;Apartment Unit 1&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Count all listed objects in A2, which are set as &quot;Apartment Unit 1&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It must be possible to easy search inside database subrows!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
3.<br/>
Percentage<br/>
There is no easy way or formula to get a comparsion between<br/>
a percentage of one object in a database, relative to the<br/>
pecentage of the whole database.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
A2 lists areas of spaces, if you want to have in B2 the percentage<br/>
of one space relative to all spaces found in A2, this is not easy to solve.<br/>
<br/>
We need a formula like:<br/>
=percentage(A2)<br/>
<br/>
/ / / <br/>
<br/>
I found solutions for all written wishes above, but the solutions are way<br/>
too complicated, sometimes you require a second worksheet as reference<br/>
(percentage), sometimes you have to write very complex formula with criteria<br/>
in a spreadsheed-cell.<br/>
All solutions, i found, are relative time-consuming to set up.<br/>
<br/>
The wishes above, improve worksheets and easy and fast to use!<br/>
<br/>

could it be possible to enhance the rendering process<br/>

Postless corners are employed by designers to articulate the infill and not disrupt the continuity of the handrail. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, posts are often designed and constructed to suit straight sections of railing and may not be readily adjusted or modified to suit a corner condition. <br/>
<br/>
Accordingly, corners are often resolved by placing posts back from the corner and cantilevering the railing and infill. However there are design and construction limits on cantilevers. <br/>
<br/>
It would be good to be able to nominate a minimum distance posts should be placed to a corner. We should also be able to nominate a maximum permitted distance.

 * Choose pixel type: RGB / RGBW / RGB+WW / RGB+CW / RBG / CW+WW<br/>
 * Easy to change intensity and colour. <br/>
 * Set power(w) pr meter and get a total wattage. <br/>
 * Set how many pixel pr meter<br/>
 * Set voltage type (12v / 24v ) <br/>
 * Frosted look and visible pixels. <br/>
 * Nits / Lux for realistic rendering<br/>
<br/>
Future development with pixel controlled LED tape<br/>
 * How many pixels pr meter<br/>
 * Set pixel section/group (How many physical LED diodes pr controllable pixel)<br/>
 * What kind of LED protocol is used. (WS2811 / WS2812 / SK9822) <br/>
 * How many DMX channels used based on length, pixel pr m and pixel section/resolution.<br/>
 * pixel control via NDI or RW texture <br/>

At this moment, the interface doesn&#39;t allow to map multiple layers at once, so everything needs to be mapped one by one.<br/>

Symbol has a benefit of being a resource and you can reference it, but when 3D is edited, you need to manually edit 2D. Autohybrid automates this workflow and generates/updates 2D from 3D. This would be really valuable for hybrid Symbols, but potentially also 2D components of Doors and Windows.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Below is from the customer, and attached is the file they sent:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
_Here are a few examples of the Auto-hybrids within symbols from our current library._ <br/>
 <br/>
_The idea that we can automate the 2D being created by just amending the 3D and not needing to amend the 2D is incredible and also with the ability to add additional 2D info if needed to the symbol._<br/>
 <br/>
_You can see in the wardrobe, we show dashed lines for doors as well but thats inside the symbol container, not the hybrid object. Which is nice to have if we don’t want the access panels to show open in 3D but still to indicate them on plan._<br/>
 <br/>
_In the future it would be incredible to just be rid of the Auto-hybrid and just integrate it into the symbol or something like this._ <br/>
 <br/>
_The reason beyond this is also to do with file management as currently the only way to see that we have auto hybrids within a project is to schedule it with a worksheet when you can’t find it visually in the design layer. However having them work as symbols will show in the resource manager._

<br/>
I would like to have the ability to either:<br/>
 # Nominate a User Weight of the base structure (before loads are added) in the OIP of the Hanging Position, or<br/>
 # For the Hanging Position to inherit a weight value from a Weight field within a Record Format. (A Weight field within the new _EntEquipUniversal_ record would be a good option).<br/>
<br/>
This would give users the ability to assess the Total Weight of all kinds of Hanging Position geometry wit their Loads attached and not just the prescribed Pipes and Trusses. There is a workaround whereby you can convert the geometry to a Truss object, but this feels clunky and is extremely time-consuming.<br/>

                TK WISH: 3D-Dragger improvements
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
the new 3D-Dragger is a fantastic tool and i love to use it.<br/>
<br/>
In the forum if read relative often, that some users<br/>
don&#39;t understand the design from the dragger.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is always a learning process in the beginning<br/>
with a new tool, but please consider my ideas. <br/>
<br/>
The user do not know that the small “dots” (close to the “mid-ball”)<br/>
are responsive for snapping to other object.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the small “dots” are too small and too close to the<br/>
“mid-ball”. It can happen that you click to the wrong item.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestions:<br/>
1.<br/>
Eliminate the small “dots” to have only arrows <br/>
2.<br/>
Arrows a bit thinner, that they do not visually block the objects so much.<br/>
3.<br/>
The behavior of the Dragger, I would think, can work good: <br/>
- Single click to an arrow = let you enter a value to move in that direction<br/>
with the possibility to enter also a value + unit (different from the doc unit) <br/>
- Remember, you can glue the object to the cursor with click and hold<br/>
press space, release click = now the object is glued to the cursor!<br/>
click and hold to an arrow = move the object with always snapping on<br/>
press optional “ALT” to have no snapping<br/>
If a user wants to change that behavior, please make an own setting for<br/>
snapping on or off.<br/>
4.<br/>
Implement a Dragger menu direct accessible on the Dragger with: right click on the<br/>
“mid-ball”.<br/>
In this menu you can have some special dragger-only settings like:<br/>
- reset the Dragger position to standard<br/>
- world based or object based position<br/>
- set snapping always on or off<br/>
5.<br/>
Scaling should be always possible (no method) change.<br/>
Most Dragger I know have a “cube” on the mid of the arrow<br/>
to have access to the scale mode.<br/>
<br/>
The Rhino-Dragger as the most flexible way to scale with it<br/>
(please see attached video)<br/>
You can scale with values: factor or enter wanted final size (with or without<br/>
units)<br/>
You can define the scaling start-point with moving the &quot;scale-cube&quot; to<br/>
the position you want to scale from.<br/>
<br/>
6.<br/>
Implement a shortcut overview with mouseover to the parts<br/>
of the Dragger = mouseover to a part and stay there for a second<br/>
shows the possible shortcuts for that part<br/>
7.<br/>
Double-click to the “mid-ball” to reposition the Dragger<br/>
8.<br/>
I know the Dragger will be implemented for more objects.<br/>
Please make sure that we also can use the Dragger to<br/>
move also objects inside other objects like: Windows<br/>
or Doors inside walls.<br/>
<br/>
/ / / <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a Rhino user. Rhino does have such a Dragger for<br/>
a relative long time and they improved the Rhino-Dragger<br/>
over the last versions of Rhino. Now with Rhino 8 Beta they<br/>
set the industry-standard for such a tool (my subjectiv opinion).<br/>
<br/>
Attached a video from the Rhino &quot;Gumball&quot; (Dragger) to show<br/>
some features I mentioned above, and I would love to see<br/>
in an improved Vectorworks-Dragger!<br/>
<br/>
Perfection would be to edit Solids directly; please see second video! <br/>
With Rhino you have a special shortcut (SHIFT + CMD) to move the<br/>
Dragger to that position (edge, point, surface) to enter an edit-mode for it.<br/>
With this edit-mode, you can manipulate fast and easy what you want!<br/>
<br/>
My customer Importance for this enhancement is set to critical,<br/>
because this (improved Dragger + direct editing of solids) would<br/>
bring VW to the next level!

Please see attached file for an example. <br/>
With current Vectorworks wall tool, users can draw red walls in the like screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
Actually they should be blue ones,  half of the wall thickness should run off from center lines. <br/>
They can draw the blue wall using multiple steps such as using auxiliary lines and offset starting points, but it would be better if they could draw it with one step.<br/>

This would effectively be DV on Tag Data as opposed to only object parameters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something you would want all the time, so it would be best to have options - object only, DT + object, DT only.

<br/>
To be clear, it&#39;s not required for GL to display DV, only to show DV Legend. In that way you could show a link (something like a callout does for example) to another drawing where position of Wall type EW-01 is shown in green, and it&#39;s fire rating is 1hr.

This isn&#39;t very user friendly if the dialog needs to be used regularly to rename always the same Category. In this case, the users always need to adjust the two pulldowns to have the desired settings.<br/>

It would be great if Vectorworks could remember the last chosen options and save it in the user prefs. In this case, the dialog would always open with the last chosen settings and that would save the user many clicks.

This post on the beta general forum:<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/111597-what-is-a-manifold-feature/<br/>
<br/>
When the user was doing an operation on walls he received the message:<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;No valid feature object is selected<br/>
Please select a manifold feature object&#39;. *<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to help but had no idea. When searching the Help nothing comes up for &#39;Manifold&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
[~mpanzer2] Very kindly saw this and posted the following:<br/>
<br/>
_&quot;I believe the alert is saying that the wall feature cannot be created because the object you’re trying to make it from is non-manifold - meaning the 3D object is not airtight.  E.g.: an extrude made from a polygon with no fill maybe render without a top and bottom.  That is non-manifold.  But, if you give the polygon in the extrude a solid fill, the extrude will have a top and bottom making it sealed tight (manifold).  So, the short answer is: There is no “manifold” feature in Vectorworks.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
This VE is to ask that there is some information added to the help that explains this issue. I now understand that it is a mathematical definition and Matt has explained how to fix it. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is more about the error message itself needing to be in more layman&#39;s terms rather than fixing the help?! It had us stumped in the office.<br/>

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
It is still a mess in the IT-world, that a user cannot decide how many<br/>
fonts are active/loaded in a software, so most users do have a lot of fonts<br/>
in the menu they don&#39;t want. A lot of font cannot deactivated OS-wise!<br/>
<br/>
Because this is so, we need search features for the font menu<br/>
to quickly jump to the font we want to choose.<br/>
<br/>
With VW 2024 we got a new Viewbar, which is great,<br/>
but the font menu in the Viewbar has no search function for fonts.<br/>
<br/>
Please enhance the Viewbar with a font-search.<br/>
<br/>
If you improve the font menu in the Viewbar, <br/>
please add also a feature/icon for font-size: +1 and font size: –1<br/>

Can we please also have “Projection Elevation” available<br/>

This would help much with a lot of calculations. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can perfectly resize your Window / Door<br/>
with the interactive blue handles BUT what if you<br/>
want to move the whole Window/Door in a 3D-View?<br/>
<br/>
This kind of movement is not very well solved at the moment!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
With the commands:<br/>
<br/>
Move 2D (CMD + M)<br/>
you can only move the Window/Door left or right<br/>
<br/>
Move 3D (CMD + OPTION + M)<br/>
you can only move the whole wall (parent)<br/>
and not the child object!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think we have two possible new options for moving:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
3D Dragger!<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
One more Interactive handle in the middle of the object<br/>
only for moving the object (left, right, up, down).<br/>
Ideal would be to have a different color instead<br/>
of blue to visualize this handle can do different things.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know Senthil is working to implement the 3D Dragger<br/>
for more object-movements, it would be great,<br/>
if he can also support Windows, Doors, Walls, …<br/>

Attached a screenshot from the settings of our current window and door tool. As you can see there are many rows with different formats:<br/>
 * Enable / Disable state (in this case Visible / Invisible)<br/>
 * Resource Picker<br/>
 * Pulldowns with different options<br/>
<br/>
Currently, only cells can only be edited one by one. The users wish to have the possibility to edit Enable / Disable OR Visible (Eye icon) / Invisible (Cross icon) for several rows at once by multi select with the shift key (Compare with Visbile / Invisible state of classes and layer lists).<br/>
<br/>
A possible solution could be to ignore cell formats that are in the current selection but different to the one where the state has been changed.<br/>
<br/>
Example 1:<br/>
 * All rows are selected<br/>
 * In one cell the item has been made visible<br/>
 * All cells in that column will get the same state (visible)<br/>
 * All cells in that column with different formats will be ignored<br/>
<br/>
Example 2:<br/>
 * All rows are selected<br/>
 * In one cell with Resource Picker a specific resource has been chosen<br/>
 * All cells in that column with Resource Picker will get the same resource<br/>
 * All other cells are ignored<br/>

Folks are used to Excel or similar when formatting cells. the same would be nice in our worksheets. Right now alignment, font, just about everything is buried in a menu item and multi-pane dialog. Making formatting data more user friendly would benefit everyone using worksheets.<br/>
 # *Summarization/Sorting enhancement -* A quick checkbox to enable/disable summarization and sorting would be beneficial when troubleshooting a worksheet. I sometimes have more than 5 columns with various settings, that are a pain to remove for checking and then re-enable.<br/>
 # *Worksheet Text Styles and Worksheet Styles -* I would like the ability to setup overall styles for worksheets that would include text styles for application to different data types Titles, Labels and data, setting should include font, font color, background color, borders, etc. to easily apply to worksheets for a consistent look throughout a file, or office.<br/>
 # *Unit Formats -* If the formula in a cell calls for a volume, the cell should display units by default, while still allowing for manual override<br/>
 # *Rounding* - Users need the ability to round values in cells. I should be manual, but if I have several hundred feet of fencing, I don&#39;t care about inches, or potentially, depending on scale It could be rounded to the nearest 10&#39; - 100&#39;<br/>
 # *More helpful report building -* When editing a report, additional filters would be helpful, but ignoring the current filter would be helpful as well. I almost never understand where the value I&#39;m looking for may be stored and the differentiation between Records, Function, Data Sheets, Styles, IFC and Cobie seems arbitrary? Many times I&#39;d like to search across all the values. Almost always, when using the search function, I am looking for counts, or numbers that return an actual value, the ability to &quot;Ignore&quot; (or filter) values that return a true or false would be extremely helpful, too. In addition, the criteria selection should be the first filter, if something isn&#39;t applicable given the selection criteria it should  be hidden, this might need to be overridden in special cases, but likely not often.<br/>
 # *Worksheet Title* - It would be great to have a checkbox to link the worksheet title and resource name, with the ability to uncheck and manually enter a worksheet title.<br/>
 # *Subpart Reporting* - (in the last couple of years) users need a way to differentiate between subparts and the main component, for instance with formatting using styles, perhaps subparts could be italic or parent objects could be semi bold? It would be good to have the option to leave non-applicable (N/A) cells blank. It would also be helpful to have a &quot;Compund&quot; cell value - assign one value to the cell for the parent object and a secondary value for subpart values?<br/>
 # *Preview Values* - It would be helpful to show preview values from the current file of selected report elements as they are added to a report.

It only asks to open without references when it can no longer find the link(s). This leads to the current workaround, to move the file to a location where it can&#39;t find the link(s) anymore.

<br/>
Actually the Patch dialog window displays all the list of patchable devices in the list including Lighting Devices and accessories. This sounds normal as Vectorworks does not make the difference between a hanging clamp or a color Frame. <br/>
<br/>
This actually works for little setups but becomes annoying and waste of time when the user wants to patch a set with hundreds of fixtures as he will get all the clamps between his lighting devices.<br/>
<br/>
A good solution should be to have the possibility to filter the accessories off of the list by DMX footprint (this criter should separate only clamps and let the color changers visible) or by Device Type<br/>
<br/>

a wish about stacked modifiers in an DTM.<br/>
Current situation is, that the data for cut and fill volume are always combined. For example the second modifier with 1 cbm is displayed in OIP as cut volume 2 cbm, because it is combined with the bigger modifier.<br/>
Those excavation works are usually done by different sub contractors and therefore you want to separate the cut and fill volume for each site modifier.<br/>
The wish is that the data, especially cut and fill volume,  are also displayed for each modifier in case of stacked (combined) modifiers.<br/>
See video and testfile.<br/>

 * SWT and other users find it problematic to control text styles via a class because it requires creating new classes and it&#39;s simply not intuitive. Instead, they would prefer to fine-tune like you would with a data tag style or graphic legends style. _&quot;Classes are obviously the best way to do things most of the time, but if I have to create a new class just to hold a text style for these snapshot legends, that’s not good. In that instance, I should be able to directly choose the desired text style rather than the roundabout way of doing it via a class.&quot; - Will Metcalf_<br/>

<br/>
The view from where the viewport was created should stay exactly how it was, but in the Pane where the &#39;target&#39; layer is visible the view could be fitted to the new viewport and it could make the &#39;target&#39; layer Pane the active one.<br/>
<br/>
We think this makes a lot of sense in the workflow where the user needs to create several (section) viewports from Top/Plan and he doesn&#39;t want to jump back to Top/Plan every time a viewport is created.<br/>
<br/>
The user probably want to have the old behavior too because it has a lot to do with how you use the Multiple View Panes, so this should be controllable via a setting.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, it could also be a setting, that it opens a new pane with the &#39;target&#39; layer if Multiple View Panes is active.<br/>

Especially landscape planners are looking for this. Currently, they need to insert a &#39;temporary&#39; stake object only to have the information of the heigt on a specific location on the DTM.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the desired z-value is only shown in the lower right corner in certain 3D views. In the 3D view from Top it doesn&#39;t work as desired since only z = 0 will be shown. In this case, the z value should be calculated on the cursor location with gravitation on the surface of the 3D object below (DTM in the example).

<br/>
The use case for this is: During a renovation/refurbishment a building&#39;s exterior or interior cladding will be removed and replaced with a newer cladding as part of a new design or as part of building envelope performance upgrades to the building. The architect will need to indicate that a particular wall is existing and will remain, but (either a portion or all of) the cladding of that wall will be replaced.<br/>

As a result of this limitation, the customer is not using Graphic Legends for Doors at all, so they draft this in 2D otherwise for every custom Door they would need to create a new Symbol containing slightly different arrangement of individual hardware items they already modelled.<br/>

The customer called this improvement a GAME CHANGER.<br/>

PS - Years ago I looked at a potential workflow for how you could create an ironmongery schedule and it was very manual and complicated. If these were individual Symbols, it would make it much easier. File is attached.

These are quite a few steps, and you need to have already a lot of knowledge about libraries and the folder structure before you can do this. I think this should be more intuïtive.<br/>
<br/>
This can be done for example in the next way:<br/>
- There can be an option to immedeiately export to a library at the moment you create a resource<br/>
- When you edit a &quot;style&quot; (object style, wall style,...) type of resource (not only via the RM, but also when you edit f.e. an object style via an object in the drawing, a button &quot;export to library&quot; can be shown, so you don&#39;t especially need to look up the resource in the RM after editing a resource<br/>
- In all cases, when you export a resource, the user should get suggested automatically the preferred location in the user of workgroup folder for that specific type of resource (the location that makes the resource visible in resource selectors). At this moment, the user needs to figure that out themselves.

The object will registrate &quot;EdgeID&quot; or &quot; &quot;EdgeProfile&quot; and when the data tag need information, it will use a provider to call special functionality and in this case the parametric object(space/countertop) will find the nearest edge to the data tag and will returns information from it - this is not the final decision(it is only an example how it could work - the problem here will be if the data tag is moved to another edge).

In stage design, they sometimes create staircases with shapes that are not used in architecture.<br/>
In particular, for stages with limited depth, we create stairs with perspective.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like it would be quite difficult to create this, and it would be difficult to create a detailed model using Vectorworks tools, but I think it would be nice if a simple model could be created easily.<br/>

 * Keystoning- Currently the new keystoning is good but many felt it wasn&#39;t realistic enough to use for real world planning. Capture was used as a good example off how lens restricted keystoning should be implimented from the user point of view.<br/>
The main issue is that the keystoning should be limited/restricted based on the projectors lens, lke it is in the real world<br/>
 * Projector content- our content is extremely limited and completely out of date with nothing really relevant for our users. Good enough for a texh demo but not useable for actual show planning<br/>
 * UST projectors and lens- Ultra Short Throw Lens&#39;s and projectors are pretty much the new industry standard when working with video projectors due to the massively reduced space requirements. We need to be able to accurately support them if we wish the projector to be used.<br/>
 * Lens shift- None of our rivals support this. Capture apparently has a work around but thats as far as it gets. <br/>
From the discussions I had, being able to control the lens shift in Spotlight as part of the set process would be a massive step forwards for most of the users.<br/>
 * Lots of questions about how to set up the projectors in Spotlight, whether the existing tool will be used or reworked? etc...<br/>
The concesus was that being able to previs the projector accurately is nice but the technical planning and documention is fundamentally more important, including being able to accurately calculate focus distances and angles.<br/>
 * Panasonic is apparently really interested in increasing projector sales in the entertainment market and is actively looking to have their products in all available CAD packages. <br/>
This may represent us with an opportunity to obtain expert advice about the lens restricted keystoning and lens shift attributes, as well as having help to update their content in our library

It can be confusing for the customer which scale Vectorworks is using to convert this Sheet layer to scale 1:1. Is that scale 1:50 of one of the Viewports or 1:20 of another Viewport<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the Viewport or Section Viewport that is at the bottom of the drawing stacking order is used as a guideline. This is the same behavior when we merge two 2D squares, the one on the bottom determines the color of the new 2D object. So if the first Viewport we put on the Sheet layer is 1:50 the DWG will use this as a guideline to export to this scale 1:1.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if we could influence this in the export. This might be possible via a popup screen so that we can indicate which scale should be used for this. Or that Vectorworks by defaults picks the scaling most commonly used on the Sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
This is all with the option: Export Viewports as 2D graphics in Model space on.

Currently only Radius exists. Obviously I can multiply this by 2, but it&#39;d be easier if I had direct access to the parameter that matches the way my brain is thinking about it.<br/>

Obviously the Radius and Diameter fields would be tied to each other, and the user could use either to affect the Sphere&#39;s size and the other would update accordingly.

                Fillet-Improvement on adjacent edges and add marque option

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      *Meeting with user Hord Coplan Macht:*<br/>
Mia, Robyn, and Nick discussed the use and potential issues of the fillet tool in Vectorworks for designing curves. Nick expressed struggles with the tool, particularly when dealing with small lines between two others, and mentioned that deconstructing the polyline to match the radii had become a workaround. The issue with this is the files they typically work on can be quite complex.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the attached video recording, I share my thoughts as to how the fillet tool can be improved and the users agreed this would be great enhancement.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
{*}Problem{*}: the fillet tool requires adjacent lines to have a length greater than the desired radius. Oftentimes, users want to either edit existing radii or place a fillet along two edges even if they are not &quot;technically&quot; adjacent but appear to be. Presently, this requires the user to decompose the object, perform the fillet on the desired lines/arcs, delete the leftover geometry, and then compose all linework. If these were plug-in objects like hardscapes or landscape areas then the problem is even longer to address.<br/>
<br/>
{*}Solution{*}: <br/>
Scenario A: If the adjacent line/arc segments are too small when performing a fillet operation, it should go to the succeeding segment until the segment is long enough to perform the desired fillet and create the desired radius. !Fillet with small segment.png|width=454,height=314!<br/>
<br/>
Scenario B (Editing radii): If an existing radius exists, the fillet operation on edges adjacent to the radius should be able to be selected and override the existing radius.<br/>
<br/>
!Fillet on existing radius.png|width=336,height=225!<br/>
<br/>
This is possible when elements are decomposed but this process is not intuitive to users and is cumbersome.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The additional request would be to have a marque option to apply fillets to multiple corners all at once. Right now, there is the ability to double-click on an object to apply the fillet to the whole object but there are many more scenarios where only a few may want to be affected.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
FYI [~bgoff] in case you want to add anything I may have missed from our meeting or if you have other scenarios you would like to share.

As far as I know, Subdivision in VW is based on OpenSubdiv,<br/>
which is developed by Pixar and is free for commercial use.<br/>
<br/>
Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2023 OpenSubdiv got an update to version: 3.5.1<br/>
<br/>
Which version of OpenSubdiv are we using in VW right now?<br/>
<br/>
If we are using an older version of OpenSubdiv,<br/>
then it could be beneficial to update to the current<br/>
version of 2023 and implement some new features<br/>
from the updated API.<br/>

<br/>
working with 3D-solids in VW is often too time-consuming,<br/>
e.g., commands like “Intersect Solids” work only with two<br/>
two objects and both objects must be on the same<br/>
DLVP.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have to intersect multiple 3D-objects, you need much time,<br/>
with other 3D software like Sketchup, such operations are done in<br/>
seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Please improve the following commands to the 21st century:<br/>
<br/>
Add Solids<br/>
Subtract Solids<br/>
Intersect Solids<br/>
Section Solids <br/>
<br/>
that they:<br/>
 * work with multiple objects on multiple DLVP<br/>
 * get tool-icons for the new View Bar<br/>
<br/>
The actual commands feel very old and should be revised quickly.<br/>

We have resisted for many years using the cabinet tools because after design, we need the construction drawings to represent industry standard for architectural construction drawings. <br/>

While anatomically correct, the elevation projection of cabinets includes far too many flush joints represented by a line. This adds visual clutter.

If you use multiple Dimension-Standards, you often need multiple classes,<br/>

Best could be to save the Class for the Dimensions in the Dimension Standards!<br/>

currently it is not possible to make a correct calculation of the ratio of the lens at different image formats beetwen screen and projector.  <br/>
<br/>
As an example a 4:3 screen with a 16:9 projector <br/>
<br/>
Here the height of the 4:3 format must be included in the calculation<br/>
to get the needed width, that you can calculate with your given formula, Ratio=distance/width.<br/>
This is not applicable with a 4:3 screen and a 16:9(10) projector.<br/>
height of the 4:3 screen with the ratio of the projector 16:9 / (16:10)<br/>
required width of the 16:9 format =<br/>
height of 4:3 screen / ratio height of proiector format (9) × ratio width of proiector format (16)<br/>
3,66 / 9 *16 = 6,5<br/>
Then only ratio=distance/width<br/>
In this case =26,7m / 6,5 = 4,1<br/>

 <br/>
While you can set a class to use a particular marker, the decision whether or not to display a marker at all is always per object, and does not save with the by class options.<br/>
 <br/>
Vectorworks used to have both a button to turn arrows on and off, as well as a pull-down menu to select the marker type. Now, you turn the marker off by selecting the “None” option in the menu.<br/>
 <br/>
To help illustrate what’s going on: <br/>
- Draw a line <br/>
- Select one of the available arrow types<br/>
- Use the menu at the top of Attributes to Make All Attributes by Class<br/>
Note that the marker type changes to it’s by-class style<br/>
- Set the marker to None<br/>
- Again, select  Make All Attributes by Class<br/>
Note that the marker style doesn’t change — no marker is a valid option for by class-settings, however the UI seems to imply that &quot;None&quot; is an option governed by the class style.<br/>
 <br/>
If I were to re-design the user interface, I would move “None” above the “Class Style” option in the marker menu.

I have noticed that the attributes palette can no longer be minimized to become more compact and take less space on the left side of the screen as it used to. The design is great but just having it a little bit more compact could benefit users to have a clearer view of all the tools in the basic and tool set&#39;s. <br/>

As well a way to snap it to the top of the screen on 2024 or future releases would be great.

 * It is expected for a cabinet to draw differently depending on the vertical position of the cabinet:<br/>

Cabinet in top view: white fill, black 0.1 mm solid line.<br/>
Door opening indication (if selected by user): no fill, black 0.1 mm solid line.<br/>
Cabinet divisions (if selected by user): no fill, black 0.1 mm dashed line.<br/>
 ** If the cabinet is sectioned in plan view (i.e. a tall cabinet), it should be drawn as sectioned:<br/>
Cabinet: fill &amp; line equal to the fill &amp; line in a section viewport through the 3D model. Typically a grey fill, black 0.18 mm solid line.<br/>
Cabinet cross: black 0.1 mm solid line<br/>
Door opening indication (if selected by user): no fill, black 0.1 mm solid line.<br/>
Cabinet divisions (if selected by user): no fill, black 0.1 mm dashed line.<br/>

The Vectorworks file is built logically: a combination of symbols and plugin objects. As would be expected, multiple instances of the same symbol are used in the Vectorworks document.<br/>
<br/>
When importing most externally-sources STEP files to Fusion, they appear with the logical hierarchical assembly/component/body structure defined in the STEP file, including multiple instances of the same part/component being presented as such (see EndPanelL used 3 times):<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-10-09-12-12-44-758.png!<br/>
<br/>
However, when importing a STEP from Vectorworks, it seems that the STEP exporter module used in Vectorworks just presents me a flat list of (354!) bodies at the root of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-10-09-12-15-42-615.png!<br/>
<br/>
The two biggest problems:<br/>
 * Hierarchy is ignored, flattening all of the logical structures of the Vectorworks file (symbol instances, plugin object instances) our to the bodies contained, in one massive list.<br/>
 * In doing so, multiple instances of the exact same thing (i.e. a symbol) become unique in the STEP file<br/>
<br/>
So the VE:<br/>
 * Vectorworks should export STEP files with at least some respect to hierarchy and components, even if not to huge levels of detail, in line with other platforms.<br/>
 * A symbol in the file should export as a component<br/>
 * Symbols within that symbol should export as subcomponents<br/>
 * Generic solids, extrudes etc should export as bodies within the relevant component or subcomponent<br/>
 * Instances of the same symbol should be exported as instances of the same Component<br/>
 * An instance of a Plugin Object should export as a component<br/>
<br/>
It could go a lot further than this, but even just being able to do this would be a huge move towards being useable.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at a STEP file from Fusion 360, they are using:<br/>
<br/>
ISO-10303-21;<br/>
HEADER;<br/>
/* Generated by software containing ST-Developer<br/>
 * from STEP Tools, Inc. (www.steptools.com) <br/>
 */<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is a simple example:<br/>
<br/>
Three symbols in VWX, each copied three times:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-10-09-12-29-56-472.png|width=418,height=219!<br/>

And imported in to Fusion:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-10-09-12-30-39-622.png|width=1088,height=443!<br/>

Really like this feature as it helps with the issue of being able to place all Racks in 3D as they are in real life. Which I couldn&#39;t do before. (Arranged them diagonally to be able to see all sides in ortho views.)<br/>
However, as far as I can see, there is no way of editing the side when racks are positioned next to each other as shown in your sample? Might be worth adding?

Long flat lists can be intimidating and require lots of column-scanning to review. Filters can help but sometimes you are interested in all of the data, but not in one massive list. One thing we do a lot of in our current reporting system is have presets to break up the data in to logical, useable chunks.<br/>
<br/>
The attached is still a list of Circuits, but is much easier to digest than a big flat list. Containment &#39;AV2&#39; is only printed once, which avoids the need for endless column-scanning to check there isn&#39;t a rogue &#39;AV3&#39; hidden in the list.<br/>
<br/>
This should have minimum 2 levels of heirarchy (in this case Position then Containment) and the ability for the name of the grouped field to appear in the header.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thinking through this further: This would be slow to configure for a user. They would be better set up as presets in our company VCS account. I make a preset called &#39;Circuits Grouped By Containment&#39;, and the user just has to select the preset they want. For companies that haven&#39;t saved any presets yet, the option wouldn&#39;t appear to the user and they could carry on as normal.

With PDF solutions this is easy, because we can just run a report filtered to the things that are ready for work.<br/>
<br/>
The upload facility may need the feature to filter the upload somehow - by Room/SubRoom or something like that, to save someone accidentally pulling cable for something that isn&#39;t approved. I don&#39;t really know exactly how this would work within the data schema behind the scenes.<br/>

Without being able to talk to Project Managers, I don&#39;t know how critical they will view this, but I can chat to them more on release and feed back. Left as medium for now.

<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/110550-circuit-arrow-style/#comment-481589]<br/>
<br/>
Could I request that the pen colour of the text within the arrow responds in the same way as the circuit bubble currently does, please?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if a circuit had only a &#39;fill&#39; data vis applied, the fill of both the bubble and arrow pill would fill themselves in reaction to the data vis, and the pen colour of both bits of text would be driven by the signal type class? This would be slick and visually more uniform.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If no data vis applied, I would suggest a black fill for brighter text could make a lot of soggy paper and ink usage. It would be ideal if this were controllable, and IMO I&#39;d probably set it to white most of the time.

couldn&#39;t find anything regarding this on the forum, but this probably came up before:<br/>

are there any plans to add a 2D view of patches, as are done in visio sometimes? (the blue and yellow cable in the below web example)<br/>
<br/>
this would be a fantastic feature for providing patch plans for the installers on site. (instead of lists or a not so readable cabeling schematics). and would probably be interesting for network, audio, video or lighting patches alike?<br/>

<br/>
I am making a personal preference request, but I think other users may appreciate it, so I wanted to raise it for consideration. It&#39;s sooooo low priority, sorry to waste your brain cycles!<br/>
<br/>
I learned VWX on a Spotlight workspace. I got very used to have the Force Select command in the right click menu. Moving to the ConnectCAD workspace, it is something I missed. While I could edit the workspace and add it-- I do wonder if it&#39;s an unnecessary friction point for users coming from Spotlight to ConnectCAD? Since that&#39;s the journey I made, and I hope more in the live events market will make, I wanted to raise it. A small default workspace change to make things more familiar for new users!<br/>
<br/>
If you folks disagree, I totally appreciate that, and feel free to close the ticket!

<br/>
An additional helpful filter would be to show only items changed by the current proposed action, which would then allow a user to refine the selection by &quot;un-checking&quot; resources prior to applying the selection.

He has a workaround -ungrouping and converting to generic solids and reapplying textures to each piece.<br/>

Breaking it down in little site models makes it easier rather than larger site models<br/>
But that means every time he has to change something, he would need to repeat the ungrouping and conversion process.

The problem exacerbates when a user positions the drawn beam inside classes and subsequently conceals those classes. Consequently, the summary key expands significantly without clear justification.

 * Add other categories of results:<br/>
 ** files in library catalog and their symbols (Resource Manager)<br/>
 ** tutorials (Vectorwoks University)<br/>
 ** help<br/>
 ** Youtube videos<br/>
 ** classes/layers<br/>
 ** objects in the document (this might need to be more intelligent to find objects with specific characteristics)<br/>
 ** actions (simple actions, turn preferences on or off, edit values, change options in pulldown, etc.). Create API for plug-in developers to add their options.<br/>
 * Allow search when there are no documents open (tools are not available but some menus are, e.g Open File menu)<br/>
 * Open tool palette where tool is so that the user learns its location<br/>
 * Instead of looking for exact matches, do fuzzy search (this allows to find results even if a user misspells a word, or if the words are in reverse order). An expansion to this would be to find results using synonyms.<br/>
 * Add API so that plug-ins can add their own search results (e.g. settings) (see actions bullet point above)<br/>
 * Separate search from displaying the results (this is an implementation detail and it will allow doing the search in a separate thread)<br/>
 * Do search in separate threads (in parallel for each category) and then update the results in the main thread<br/>
 * Search only when search string changes (results do not change when changing categories, so the search process doesn&#39;t need to be run again)<br/>
 * Change category buttons to toggle buttons to filter results<br/>
 * Put question mark buttons in the results that open the &quot;What’s This&quot; help page for the item<br/>
 * VE-104154: better results should appear at the top

                Boomerang Mode requires mouse move to get cursor to change

<br/>
At least on Mac, when the space bar is held down to activate Boomerang mode, the cursor does not change shape until the mouse is moved. This has confused multiple users thinking that boomerang mode is not active.<br/>
<br/>
When the space bar is held down, the Pan tool is temporarily activated. Historically (certainly before Smart Options Display, not certain about more recently), when the active tool changed, the cursor also changed to the Hand tool to provide the user visual feedback that the tool had changed.<br/>
<br/>
That visual feedback is not currently being provided until the mouse position is moved. <br/>
<br/>
If you watch on the Mac, when the space bar is help down, the Pan tool is activated in the Basic Tools palette, but the cursor does not change. After the mouse is moved the cursor changes.<br/>
<br/>
Desired Behavior is that the cursor will change at the same time the tool is activated to provide the user with visual feedback that the desired Boomerang Mode is active.

The request is that the ability to access Room Plan/LIDAR/Photos to 3D is placed at the bottom of the app and not the &#39;+&#39; sign at the top right. <br/>
It is not obvious to users that this is where to access these great features. As one said to me in support &quot;it&#39;s not very intuitive&quot;. Even if there was a plus at the bottom it would be better. Currently there&#39;s the Measure/Files/Account at the bottom. Maybe it could say &quot;apps or services&quot; or something more obvious?<br/>

Use case for this would be to make a privacy railing or to &quot;beef&quot; up the railing so that the posts could be hidden behind the infill. I&#39;ve detailed this in a studio where there are horizontal bars on either side and they are staggered so that you cant see through the railing. This can apply to fences as well. I have screenshots of a privacy fence that I have modeled, but this can work with railings as well. <br/>
<br/>
Also, alternating post sizes and spaces would be a nice option as well. I have also done this in practice, where for example a post is 4x4 and the railing could span a longer distance with an intermediate post in between that is smaller.

                Camera requires professional level &#39;shift&#39; setting for architectural visuals ( 2 point perspective )

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When it comes to setting perspective views, Vectorworks users are at a disadvantage compared to most major competitive visualisation software, because we lack an easy way to simulate what is known as a &#39;shift&#39; or &#39;shift &amp; tilt&#39; lens. This lens type, allows the photographer/visualiser to create what would be also be known to illustrators as 2 point perspective.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is important to understand that 2d point perspective is not an invented projection (such as Cabinet or Cavalier Oblique)  as such - rather, it is a standard real world perspective view, with the following set up:<br/>
<br/>
1) the &#39;camera height&#39; is identical to the &#39;look to height&#39;<br/>
<br/>
2) the image focal point is not in the middle of the view frame, but is &#39;shifted&#39; towards either the the bottom of the view frame or the top of the view frame (depending on whether the view is a ground view shot or a birds eye shot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
+It should not be underestimated that almost every professional level architectural and interior image or photograph is taken using this setup.+<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To achieve this set up in Vectorworks in a Design Layer not possible at all. <br/>
<br/>
To achieve this set up in Vectorworks in a Sheet Layer is beyond the average user which entails an in depth knowledge of the principle of &#39;shift and tilt&#39; lenses in order to create a long winded workaround that our competitors achieve with the clicking of a checkbox. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As a result, the vast majority of 3D perspectives in Vectorworks do not match those of professional photographer OR our competitors. This request therefore calls for a solution which provides a more automated approach to achieving the points 1) + 2) above.<br/>

Just as slab offsets and other PIOs in VW, the roof face should have individual edge controls for correctly modeling offsets. Yes we could push-pull these to correct positions, but then the roof face object is lost, with all its controls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the extensions are not correctly joined at the ridge intersection of 2 roof faces. No option on the connect/combine tool will fix it. See attached.

The main goal of this is the availability to export a dwg file in a cartesian coordinates of a EPSG and true north.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, there is the option to match the georefercing coordinate system in the user origin window, but not the angle.<br/>
<br/>
To add this in a specific menu would also allow to re-call precisely an origin and an angle for building with multiple angles.

<br/>
This creates some behavior that may be a bit unintuitive to users: when they change an SM&#39;s style via the OIP / Replace Style to a default content style, the shape and size does not change, because only the By Style values are loaded (see VB-199421 and VB-199422).<br/>
<br/>
This is by design, because the styles are rather general in nature. However they do specifically mention the shape in the Style name. It may be best to add more styles using more of the shapes available in the content, and set the Shape and Size parameters to be By Style.<br/>
<br/>
See the discussion in VB-199421 and VB-199422 for more info.

The inconsistency between the two search behaviours is something that we should eliminate. The expected (and more &quot;modern&quot;) behaviour would be that all searches would be live and continuous, like the searches in the Viewbar popovers.<br/>

Observe the requirement to extend the handrail the width of one tread at the bottom of the stair. Observe also the requirement to extend the handrail horizontally (AS 1421.1 Handrail Terminations pp48.png).<br/>

<br/>
Extruded contours do not model vertical walls created by planar pads.<br/>
<br/>
Instead the contours walk around the planar pads (along their boundaries) and if there are a lot of planar pads which are sticked together, then the contours may have to surround a very big area, instead of directly walking through the planar pads. This may shift the extruded contours to look very differently from the 3D mesh (as in VB-197586).<br/>

Implementing this VE will fix bugs such as VB-197586, VB-198619, VB-198666.

It&#39;s probably more a wish than a bug, but I suppose that user should have quick access (from OIP) to a little bit more options, than he/she has now. For example, it would be good to control post settings in such a rapid way, without the need for opening the settings pane. It&#39;s obvious that OIP can&#39;t keep all settings as it would be too much, but just major types of option from each element category would be nice, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
I rolled the categories up to show that there are only a few categories avaliable. There are not many setting types avaliable in from the OIP.

Wish: When exporting a slab element as IFC, there should be the possibility, as already done with walls, that the object can subsequently be exported as the entire object and the components can be added by Shift key. This currently only works for the wall.

<br/>
if you add a Data Tag to an object,<br/>
the placement of the Data Tag will<br/>
be, as defined.<br/>
<br/>
But what if you resize the object?<br/>
The Data Tag stays at its last position.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see a dynamic placement system,<br/>
relative to the Bounding Box of the object.<br/>
<br/>
If you resize the object, the Data Tag can change<br/>
the placement too, and e.g., always stay in the middle<br/>
of a tagged object.<br/>
<br/>
Modes could be:<br/>
<br/>
Top-Left, Top-Middle, Top-Right<br/>
Mid-Left, Mid-Mid, Mid-Right<br/>
Bottom-Left, Bottom-Mid, Bottom-Right<br/>
<br/>
+ Shift-Distance (in x- and y-direction) to this dynamic placement.<br/>

<br/>
for labeling a Sheet-Layer-Viewport (SLV) we have a special Tool: “Drawing Label”.<br/>
<br/>
The labels are placed inside the annotations layer of the SLV.<br/>
<br/>
A German customer had the idea to label SLV with the Data Tag<br/>
(outside the annotations layer) and I found the idea useful.<br/>
<br/>
Please give us access to some data fields of the SLV to build Data Tags.<br/>

<br/>
The location of few items have changed now on the view bar compared with VW2023 and previous versions. <br/>
<br/>
For example, users got use to have the zoom and scale in the center of the bar, current projection and current view on the right hand side. Now in VW2024 their position has changed and there is no way to adjust it apart from pin them in or out from the View Bar causing some constrains in the user&#39;s experience getting used to the new version. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps adding the ability to change the position of the tools/items in the view bar setting could be a solution so everyone would be able to customise it as they wish. Maybe just adding the ability to grab and drag them up and down on the View Bar Setting menu in order to customise their position in the view bar? Adding the View Bar to the Workspace editor and adjusting the position of items in there? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks

However if the printer does not have equal non printable edges the print does not end up central on the paper.<br/>

A solution to both problems would be to have 4custom offsets (top left right bottom)  from the &#39;Fit to page&#39; dimensions which can be customised to the printer. <br/>

it would be great if the editor stays open to be able to correct the error. this is what happens in Excel for example. you get told &quot;something is wrong&quot; and then get a chance to fix it, without having to do it all over again.

- Move Edges Preserve Area Mode<br/>

An electrician won&#39;t be able to work on cable tool items, while a lighting designer wants to assign lights to an inventory. I&#39;d like to see the lights being assigned to an inventory source without needing to check out their attached cables. Also, if we&#39;re assigning just a few lights, the rest shouldn&#39;t be checked out.<br/>

We need to let users work on single objects in a drawing without checking out other items that seem unrelated.<br/>

Select one of the polylines and use the tool &quot;Create Objects from Shapes...&quot; to create a Hardscape with a Path Configuration, like its shown in the video.<br/>

It would make sense to look at the Speaker array tool for inspiration regarding curved led-tools where you can sett individual off-set / degree per speaker. <br/>
<br/>
If the LED-Screen configurator would make a list of LED-columns left to right, one LED-column = one row (like the speaker tool per speaker) and then we have the possibility to set a curve degree pr column 2dg/5dg/10dg etc. <br/>

Right now I don&#39;t have a proper way to visualise / map an image on a curved wall espetssialy since we&#39;re missing &quot;perimeter mapping&quot; for texture. Not sure if this is a bug that perimeter mapping it not presented as a texture mapping option for a geometry? <br/>

[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/110559-importing-a-colors-from-one-file-to-another/#comment-481276]<br/>
<br/>
Existing color palettes seem to be stored as XML files, so hopefully none if this means reinventing the wheel. That&#39;s never a good approach.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to be able to create and name colors.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to import colors and name/rename them.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to be able to delete colors and replace a color I am deleting with a new color. So, if I have six reds (red1, red2, etc) if I delete one VWX should off me a dialog to replace that color. Think symbols. This is especially true when multiple colors can have the same definition. VWX should be able to figure that out.<br/>
<br/>
I need to be able to import a color and rename, so PMS xyz might become client blue XYZ<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to readily delete colors from a. document<br/>
<br/>
I often need a color to do many things; a solid fill, multiple textures. It would be ideal to do this with one color definition. This might involve some wheel reinvention, so...<br/>
<br/>
It has been suggested that color and palettes be resources. That makes some logical sense, not sure how that impacts the complexity of the engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Purging colors should be simpler<br/>
<br/>
I am sure I could edit or create my own XML files, but computers are supposed to make things easier

Within the Title Block Layout editor, would be great to introduce *Layout Constraints* similar to those found in Data Tags and Graphic Legends. The feature would enable graphic elements like lines or rectangles to adjust to dynamic/linked text. <br/>
<br/>
This would be an advantage/benefit because the actual text values for associated parameters within the Title Block Manager varies. Another key example includes the lists for issue and revision data within the Title Block Border. The goal would be to have the graphic elements within the title block automatically adjust to accommodate added text information as the project develops over time.

 * Unit Size<br/>
 * Rough Opening<br/>
<br/>
(The CW Window has similar Size References)<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the chosen Size Reference the control points of the interactive resizing have different locations. If the customer wants to align windows or doors to other elements in the drawing, he needs to choose the matching Size Reference. As the customer realizes the current Size Reference is wrong, it is necessairy to open the settings dialog or change the Size Reference through the OIP. This is very interupting.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if changing the Size Reference could be interactive during the resizing too. E.g. compare changing the Control Line from left to right when drawing a wall (Left/Right control line mode).

Plus, designers often use architectural wall screens to subdivide spaces for privacy, safety, or security, whether exterior or interior. In each case, an operable (“open-able”) segment is required for access or egress.

When editing the boundary of a Seating Section with the Reshape tool, each time a vertex has been moved the &#39;Seating Boundary Changed&#39; dialogue comes up. <br/>
When working intensely as I have been doing, this comes up every few seconds! The wish is that there&#39;s an &#39;Always Do&#39; option so that this doesn&#39;t distract from the work.<br/>
In fact, what is even more annoying is that the option 2 in the dialogue &#39;Apply the changes...don&#39;t refill the section&#39; is very obscure. Why would someone want to do this anyway?!<br/>

This was VB:<br/>
https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-198904<br/>
As graphic functionality with the instrument Summary has changed. The wish is that this is restored so that users can have a coloured border as they used to in v2023. I realise this is a minor wish but important for some.<br/>
<br/>
In previous versions if you place an instrument Summary (IS) on the page and have the Bounding Border Style set to Double, then if you change the colour fill only the border changes colour. This is the current functionality and is useful for those using the double border.<br/>
In v2024 if you try the same then the entire Instrument Summary&#39;s fill changes. This is not desired. Please see attached screenshots of the same IS in both v2023 and v2024.<br/>

The user has to duplicate an existing Object Style from the Resource Manager, or select an unstyled Joinery object in the drawing and do one of the following:<br/>
# use the command &#39;Create plug-in Style&#39;<br/>
# right mouse click &gt; ‘new plug-in style’ <br/>
# In the OIP &gt; ‘New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in&#39; from the Style dropdown<br/>
<br/>
However, when user&#39;s are working in the dialog, it is not possible to create a new object style from there. Adding an extra Save Style button in the dialog could save te user a few steps. <br/>
<br/>
This feature is highly requested to solve a regression on our part:<br/>
<br/>
In the DE windoor tools, until 2023, it was possible to save project windows directly from the object settings dialog, or from the tool&#39;s preferences dialog.<br/>
For VW 2024, we are preparing to replace our project windows with Object Styles. However, new Object Styles cannot be created from the dialog, which means there will be a regression compared to our previous project window system.

<br/>
However, while the resulting wall provides visual cues for indicating its direction (the blue arrow at the start of the wall), railings do not. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, railings would benefit from having visual cues for assisting the user in determining the direction/sequence of clicks (when in Polyline mode) and in determining the offset direction, whether a positive or negative value is appropriate to achieve the desired result.

So it seems that the Medium Detail has the &quot;priority&quot; and this Medium detail level definition will always be used as a resource preview. If this definition is empty, then the resource manager preview will be empty.<br/>

It would be nice if it can be controlled which definition of a symbol/PIO should be used for the resource preview and it would be nice to have a way to control this using SDK.<br/>

<br/>
After a training session, I received a really great request from a customer. Please have a look at the video.<br/>
<br/>
It’s too easy for a customer to loose control from whch file resources are referenced. There are several option like „Priority Order“ or really „use the file from where the resource comes“. So if the Team is not well organized it might be that you get a mess in from where the resources are referenced.<br/>
<br/>
Idea: We think it would be fantastic to add an option the the references that allows a user to define that the resources CANNOT be referenced from specific files. In that way you can force the user to reference from the file you are allowed to do.<br/>

 * Final Shaded Polygon<br/>

We think that these render looks often cause issues if they are used. They require a lot of memory and have performance issues the more curved surfaces there are in the scene. Currently we have a Spotlight user complaining about performance and you can imagine how many round faces are in the file :)<br/>
<br/>
We also log VB-183635 for that.<br/>

Maybe Vectorworks, Inc. should consider to deprecate or replace them (“painter’s algorithm” or AI ;)) in the future.

Currently symbols have a number of different components (2D, 3D, Wall Hole, Wall Closure, etc). I am proposing that there be an additional component that would act as a repository for images. At least one, but hopefully two or three images would be allowed. An example of an image that might be stored could be a photograph of the product, sample of a fabric, QR code, colour, etc.<br/>
<br/>

Data Tags would then need the ability to display such images with the ability to control scale/size. Given worksheets and graphic legends already have the ability to display images, these entities should also be able to display symbol images.{*}{*}<br/>

I often inadvertently pull the Attribute palette away from the tools sets that sit above. Like how we can lock individual tabs from being pulled away in the OIP and Nav palettes, it would be handy to enable that for the overall palette layout configuration. Maybe as a Quick Preference.<br/>
<br/>
Usually once a person has everything as they want, they would prefer to avoid the occasional undocking.<br/>
<br/>
This would also be good for organisations so that everyone is using the same workspace. It would also avoid the problem I see in support of people &#39;losing&#39; their palettes (usually the Resource Manager especially on Windows) even though ticked in the Window&gt;Palettes command.  Somehow it gets squashed up very thinly between other palettes. I tell the users to Control-R to switch on and off very quickly in order to find where it is.<br/>
<br/>
All up a &#39;Lock Palette Position&#39; would be very handy.<br/>

<br/>
at this point, all devices that will be created by worksheet are in one lane.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s pretty hard to identify different device types, especially when a lot of devices are in the worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
So it would be great: <br/>
- to see them grouped after creating. <br/>
- to see the Model-Name above each group.<br/>
- if a room name is given, the room should be created around the devices (That would make it easier to find, even when the room itself has no depencies to the device.)<br/>
<br/>
For a better feeling what the matter could be, attached a file with a worksheet that has a lot of devices.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and have a good one!<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards<br/>
Alex

                Fence Tool - Add &#39;handed&#39; end posts for fence and gate. 
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Find attached a sample file with the frameless glass pool fencing design that is ubiquitous in Australia. We have a very strict code and standard AS 1926.1 that tightly prescribes the requirements. You can see typical examples:<br/>
[https://forgehardware.com.au/news/post/buy-frameless-glass-fencing-online-do-it-yourself.html]<br/>
[https://thearchitectschoice.com.au/glass-pool-fencing/]<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, you will notice each panel has two stanchions. This is achieved by having two stanchions as part of each Post Symbol definition offset symetrically from the insertion point. <br/>
The end post is a special, with only one offset stanchion. <br/>
<br/>
However, the result is that the end post is applied incorrectly to the opposite end of each fencing run. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if a gate post (with a similarly single offset stanchion) is applied, then the stanchion will appear correctly on one side of the gate, but not the other. <br/>
<br/>
I think we need two enhancements: <br/>
1. The ability to have alternative end posts - so a single &#39;handed&#39; spigot may be correctly drawn at the end of each run. (or possibly a mirror option?)<br/>
2. The ability to have alternative gate posts - so the two panels on either side of a gate can have &#39;handed&#39; spigots. (or - once again - a mirror option?)<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think it would be more flexible to have the ability to have different end conditions. For example, another (different) common scenario is when one end of the fence abutts a wall (with stand-off brackets) and the other &#39;free&#39; end terminates with a post. Similarly for gates, it is common to have a special post on one side (perhaps the hinged - load bearing - side) and a standard post on the latch side.

Would be great, if the way circuit arrows are shown would be controlled by &quot;nested symbols&quot; (just like e.g. the device port layout).<br/>
That way I can incorporate changes to all similar connections in one central location?

I&#39;ve expanded the NIR with a CIDR mask field, and then a Concat field to concat the IP and CIDR mask together. Our device labels will then have a field for IP: 192.168.9.34/24.<br/>

!image-2023-07-21-15-08-48-118.png!<br/>

It would be better if this integrated with the normal subnet field - changing the long-form subnet changes the CIDR, and vice versa. I didn&#39;t fancy the maths for this in the data manager though!

Since the entire dialogs of these PIOs can be made wider (which currently only makes the 3D preview &quot;column&quot; of the dialog wider), it would be great if the center-most column of the dialog could be dragged wider to resize it as needed.<br/>

While hoists are better since they have autonumbering, they do not display any info about what they are hung from or support.<br/>
<br/>
This lack of Data flow and autonumbering results in slow inefficient design workflow and makes documentation much harder as alot of needed info is inaccessable to the user.<br/>
<br/>
Adding auto numbering to the bidle tool, <br/>
with options to number<br/>
 * attached hoists when used as a downleg<br/>
 * label the bridle based on an existing hoist id (when a bridle is inserted onto an existing hoist)<br/>
<br/>
would greatly improve bridle design speed<br/>

Adding some parameters to the hoist and bridle to document and display what they hung from and support<br/>
New parameters<br/>
 * Hoist<br/>
 **  high hook connection- auto populates based on the id of whatever the hoist is hung from (hanging point, truss position name, bridle ID, hanging position, pipe or structural member)<br/>
 ** low hook connection- auto populates based on the ID of whatever is hung from the hoist (trussline (position name) pipe, hanging position, speaker array, load object, bridle, etc....)<br/>
 * Bridle<br/>
 ** Leg X connection- displays the id of whatever the upper leg of the bridle is hung from, ( where X is the leg number)<br/>

What doesn&#39;t help for the usability, is the fact that the preview isn&#39;t showing the inserted object at the location it is inserted by default.<br/>
This is understandable if you&#39;re editing the wall closures via the wall settings, because not every object will be inserted at the same location. But when you edit the wall wrapping for a specific object, you&#39;d expect the inert location in the preview to sync with the object&#39;s real insertion point.

Up until v2024 the &#39;Convert to Hanging Position&#39; has been in the &#39;Convert&#39; submenu in Spotlight. This is logical and easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
In v2024 this command is in the &#39;Lighting&#39; sub menu. This is illogical and does not make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Audio, masking, rigging, visual and set departments might all want to be using Hanging Positions (HPs). HPs are not the exclusive domain of the electrics department. Even myself drawing something up, as an ex LD, went straight to the Rigging/Braceworks sub menu to convert some truss as that seemed logically the place to go.<br/>
Thus the wish is that the &#39;Convert to Hanging Position&#39; command be moved to the Rigging /Braceworks sub menu.<br/>

It would be nice to refine VWDialog::OnKeyEvent into two methods:<br/>

A texture is then added to the &quot;rail&quot; to represent the fence style. This fails in several ways:<br/>
 # The texture does not follow any slope on which the fence is placed.<br/>
 # when broken, the fence tool uses the center point of the rail, rather than &quot;clipping&quot; the rail perpendicular to grade<br/>

<br/>
This was originally a request to the web team. The web team says they are not going to have a form tool on the new CMS and we need to move this request to the Customer Portal team.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the original request:<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
Juan and I were discussing the feedback form which we have a link to from every page in the Vectorworks help system… this one: [https://www.vectorworks.net/support/help-feedback]<br/>
Timi set that up for us, to work in English, Spanish, and Chinese.<br/>
Users are complaining that when they submit feedback, they don’t get some kind of response like “Your feedback has been received, thank you” or whatever. Timi thinks it would be possible for the feedback form to send an automated message.<br/>
English: Thank you! Your feedback about the help system has been received.<br/>
Spanish: ¡Gracias! Los comentarios sobre el sistema de ayuda han sido recibidos.<br/>
Chinese: 谢谢你！ 关于帮助系统的意见已经收到。<br/>
----------------------<br/>
So now, we need to request that:<br/>
 * The feedback form, in three languages, gets moved to the customer portal. Once we know what the new location is, we&#39;ll change the URL for future help versions.<br/>
 * A redirect occurs so that for any current versions of Vectorworks, customers can still click on the link.<br/>
 * Customers receive an automated acknowledgement email in the appropriate language (the original request).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Sasha, I&#39;m assigning this bug to you, but please assign this to the correct person who should handle it.<br/>
Let me know if you have any questions.<br/>
Thank you!

<br/>
—In order to derive the surface area of the various color-coded areas, the Site Model must be exploded (converted to group); the user may then use a worksheet or custom selection to tabulate all the like-colored areas. Ideally, exploding would not be necessary and the Site Model could populate worksheets (and the OIP) directly. Furthermore, the user should be able to choose 3D surfaces or 2D surfaces to report (as they will be different values).<br/>
<br/>
—The Site Model is not controllable with Data Visualization (DV)—and to be fair the colored slope Site Model feature predates DV by years. The advantage of implementing DV is obvious: the user would not need to explode or create alternate Site Models (one for &quot;normal&quot; presentation and one for slope analysis)

A parameter &quot;page symbol rotation&quot; in the advanced viewport settings in the OIP would allow the user to manage this.<br/>

Observe the way the fence height transitions from the standard 1800mm high down to about 1000mm high. This is a very common local govt. requirement for boundary fences as the reduced height allows for visibility to pedestrians on the footpath as vehicles back out of driveways. <br/>
<br/>
It is also a common requirement for pool fences to maintain minimum heights above local high spots on terrain.

Another example: a two-story house with a detached garage. Due to topography, the garage is half a story up from the ground floor of the main house. Ideally, I could create a Story-1.5 for the garage with its own foundation, wall, and roof design layer levels, but that would pose a problem for the stair from the main house ground floor to the main house upper floor.<br/>
<br/>
My workaround is two create new level types (e.g., garage, garage foundation, garage roof) for Story-1, but that&#39;s inelegant.

Real use example:<br/>
I needed top use this functionality when I was helping a customer with a marionette script. I needed geometrical information from the hardscape further on in the script, which I couldn&#39;t retrieve from the hardscape itself. But the marionette node &quot;convert to polygon&quot; didn&#39;t function, just like the command doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
You can convert a slab to a poly by ungrouping in a 2D view, but this also doesn&#39;t work with the &quot;ungroup&quot; mationette node (which only works on object type &quot;group&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine converting slabs ans hardscapes to poly&#39;s can be useful in other workflows as well.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the attached video and file, there is a railing whose posts are in the locations where the designer would like them to be. A change in the upper floor design has added a landing at the top of the stair, so the designer would like to merely move the post that is at the (top) end of the path to be at the wall on the other side of the upper landing (which is a slab).<br/>
<br/>
The designer&#39;s expectation would be that they should simply be able to edit the railing&#39;s path and extend it to the wall in 2D, which would put a post at the wall and likely another post along that landing (as per the style&#39;s settings). <br/>
<br/>
However, what happens is that the *entire* railing&#39;s posts reset and now the previously correct positions are lost. While the designer could do the work to re-place all the posts in the previous positions, this would not be a welcome solution and would cause frustration. This reset of posts would likely also install doubts in the designer that any railing they had previous created anywhere in the design would maintain its &quot;fidelity&quot; if it had been accidentally adjust by themselves or another team member at their firm. <br/>
<br/>
I realize there is currently no option to &quot;lock&quot; posts but if there is an option to stop the reset of posts when a segment of path is edited, please let me know. If this is not technically a &quot;bug&quot; but should instead become an enhancement requisition for Railings 2.0, then it would be great to turn it into a VE. Designers will likely expect that once created, railings in segments that have not been adjusted will not move or reset.

We think there are two solutions to solve this issue:<br/>
 * Show a warning when exiting the symbol (similar to the situation if the symbol will contain no objects at all)<br/>
 * Automatically show the High Detail Level in this case. If High is empty too, automatically show the Low Detail Level<br/>

In our opinion, the 2nd solution would be preferable.

I&#39;ve noticed that the Spotlight Settings command is a bit inaccurate, as it contains also Braceworks and Cable Preferences (apart from Bridles and Spotlight).<br/>

What about calling it: Entertainment Settings, also to make the difference between Spotlight Settings and Spotlight Preferences submenu more evident?<br/>

We do have an Entertainment menu, so I think that such a commando would be in line with it:<br/>

So you can give the wall components no line. In that case, the lines also will not be shown in a section. (see how I set the slab and roof in the attached video and file).<br/>
<br/>
The example above is just an example, there might be other reasons for wanting an object specific outline for slabs and roofs in section, like wanting control over the line thinckness of the objects section contour independent from the component line thicknesses. <br/>
<br/>
I know you can more or less resolve this by adding a profile line in the advanced section viewport settings, but I don&#39;t think you should need the profile line to get an appealing section for the reasons underneath:<br/>
<br/>
For a wall in plan view, it will be the object attributes which determine the line thickness of the wall&#39;s outline. Until version 2020, this also determined the line attributes in a section viewport (see https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-198495)<br/>
<br/>
For consistency , you&#39;d expect slabs and roofs to function in a similar way for section viewports, so the behavior of graphics in section viewport is more predictable for the user. This would avoid for the user to be forced to do a search for the right settings after a section viewport is created.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, a profile line might add a line on the correct location indeed, but since a profile line is the same for all objects, the user doesn&#39;t have optimal control over the line thicknesses in the drawing.

<br/>
That said, it has been ages since i had to build a new OIP menu from scratch, and quite frankly, the Spotlight Preferences menu desparately needs updating and simplification.<br/>
<br/>
I opened the Spotlight Preferences window. I turn off the unneeded data fields in “show in shape pane” column; [the sensitivity checking a shape pane on or off is very slow - i’m constantly having to wait for some amount of time to first select, then second click to turn off. instead, it constantly opens the “edit” window for that data field. can’t the amount of time between first and second click be shortened?]<br/>
<br/>
i resort the order of the parameters; i save this arrangement as “conventionals.” i click ok, i view the OIP results, i return to the parameters window to make adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
when i re-open the window, it displays the contents of the “conventionals” OIP arrangement, but as soon as i merely select a row of data [much less click it a second time to turn it on or off] the settings dropdown reverts to &lt;custom settings&gt; *without* reverting to the default custom settings window? Why? why doesn’t it remain the “conventionals”? <br/>
<br/>
naturally i don’t notice this, make changes, *then* notice it. change the settings back to “conventionals”, and lose all my changes.<br/>
<br/>
so i make all the changes again, then click on “save” and am presented with the window showing NO options other than a blank window. Why? why doesn’t the “save…” window be combined with the “manage…” window, so i can select a previously-saved name, or enter in a new one? <br/>
<br/>
so i’ve now forgotten what the saved name is, so i type in “conventional” [singular], accidentally creating a second setting name. now i need to compare “convential” to “conventials” in order to figure out which one i need to keep and which one to delete. <br/>
<br/>
when i click on “manage” and view the two names, clicking on a name doesn’t show that particular saved set. only clicking on the dropdown “settings” menu shows each one, one at a time. <br/>
<br/>
and oh yeah, by the way, what is the difference in the “settings” dropdown between &lt;custom settings&gt; and &lt;spotlight&gt;? they seem exactly the same to me?<br/>
<br/>
Please put a review/upgrade/revisit of the Spotlight Preferences window palettes on the “to do” list!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Steve

                Railings: The ability to reset the post placement for an entire railing or a single segment of a railing
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Stemming from the conversation here: [https://vectorworks.slack.com/archives/C041B05BZHN/p1690928338692339]<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to have the ability to rest the guardrail post placement for either an entire railing or for a single segment of a multi-segment railing.<br/>
<br/>
It is very conceivable as part of a design workflow that a user would try to move guardrail posts to custom positions, but then realize that they had made a bit of a mess of the positions and needed to start fresh with that entire railing (or segment).<br/>
<br/>
Currently, it is possible to &quot;rest&quot; post portions to their style&#39;s defaults by either flipping the railing&#39;s offset twice or replacing the style twice (once to a different style and once again to get back to the original style) but this is neither obvious nor ideal. Also, it resets the post positions for the *entire* railing, when only reseting a segment may be desired.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

<br/>
This request was also prompted by a customer who felt SketchUp&#39;s flyover was better — more user-friendly and functional. Like Tom (above), the customer wants to activate the flyover tool and “orbit” relative to the last cursor location on the screen — that is, without having to set or reset the mode each time, which is necessary, even with Interactive Origin Mode selected. Try it yourself. You’ll notice that the Interactive Origin isn’t aligned with the cursor position in the same way zooming functions with the middle mouse wheel. If we can “zoom” toward the position of the cursor, why can&#39;t we also &quot;orbit&quot; around the last cursor position?

Unfortunately this saved dwg export set is not found by Vectorworks when you copy it to the appropriate location in the workgroup/project folder.<br/>

We think that this is a bug.<br/>
When it works from user folder then it should also works from workgroup/project folder.<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

<br/>
The correct way to use storeys is to (almost?) *_+NEVER+_* assign Design Layers to Storey Levels. This dialogue creates anxiety that they might not be using the tool the right way.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever have more than Design Layer assigned to a Storey, you cannot assign more than one Design Layer two a single Storey Level. Because of this limitation, assigning Design Layers to Storey Levels does not work. And this scenario happens all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
For example, for complex adaptive reuse (renovation) projects, it makes sense to separate &#39;new work&#39; from &#39;existing work&#39; into different Design Layers. They are both on the same Storey and using the same Storey Level, but they both cannot be assigned to that level. It therefore makes sense to remove this dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
Please remove it.<br/>

* a time estimation how long it will take until the sync is completed<br/>

Additionally it would be very useful for our customers using project sharing to see, when an upload or a download has finished. That could be by animating the task icon, using colors or popping up a short message (with the file name) that disappears after a few seconds. These could be options for the user to setup as they want. Consider what happens should Vectorworks be maximized on macOS.

<br/>
I received a few requests to change the tilt/pan angle back to the default value whenever the focus point, the LD is pointing to, gets deleted.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you need to rearrange the LD angles. At some cases you get a few LDs on top or some LDs less to rearrange. If the new angle differs slightly you may not know, which LDs have been changed and which should be adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
So it would be very helpful to have the LDs getting into default mode, pointing to the down, when the Focus Point gets deleted.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a button &quot;Set Lighting devices into Default State&quot; command with options<br/>
 * All LD<br/>
 * Selected LD<br/>
 * LDs on current Layer<br/>
 * LDs on current Class<br/>
 * LDs without Focus Point<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you<br/>
Best<br/>
Alex

<br/>
However, hoist symbols on a rigging plot should be aligned as per the symbol definition at all times.<br/>
<br/>
I think there should be a tickbox in the OIP of &#39;Disable Plan Rotation&#39;, whereby rotation of the hoist will rotate the 3D component but the 2D will be as per the symbol definition.<br/>
<br/>
A Custom Plan Rotation as per lighting devices would be cumbersome - as for a hoist rotated by X degrees, the user would always need to figure out the opposite rotation to cancel it out and enter that. Forcing lock to &#39;normal&#39; rotation would be much better.

We have had a few complaints through frustrated Landmark users not easily being able to change the Full ID number of Existing Trees (ET) already drawn.<br/>
<br/>
This must be because of common workflows where they might have missed one or added and changed a few things around for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to change the Full ID Number is to select each ET individually and in the OIP click the Tag and Number options.<br/>
<br/>
You then have to turn off &#39;Auto Number for this Tree&#39; whereby you can then change the Full ID Number. This might be bearable for a residential design but we have landscape architects dealing with acreages and large areas sometimes containing hundreds of trees.<br/>
<br/>
The request is that the Spotlight Numbering command that can change anything with a record and any chosen field be adapted and incorporated into the Landmark module (and Architect actually). The best thing is that it can number manually or by direction and so on. This would really help with this tedious work when editing this type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

Based on communication with our client &quot;lack of this tool shows huge weakness compared to revit in professional interior design workflow, since in many cases reflected ceilings are 1/3 of the whole drawings set.&quot;

<br/>
We wish to have some kind of separator between panes that can be grouped together.<br/>
<br/>
In the attachment you&#39;ll find an example of the german window tool. We tried to add empty spaces between groups. But the result isn&#39;t very satisfying (we won&#39;t implement it like this).<br/>
<br/>
Another example is the macOS (Ventura) system preferences. They used also a space between groups. But honestly, this is also still to complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a line would be a good solution. Or something similar to the separator in the list of the Layer pulldown in the view bar (Sheet Layer and Design Layer).<br/>
<br/>
Technically, it would be already possible to add titles of groups and indented names of panes in the list (see also example screenshot in german). But this wouldn&#39;t match the Vectorworks standard. We think a general solution should come from VW Inc as a guideline for all settings dialogs.<br/>

So in some way, this is the expectation customers have if they learn about the Nomad app the first time.<br/>
The current functionality where PDF&#39;s are generated from the file, doesn&#39;t feel much more efficient than manually export the PDF&#39;s from Vectorworks and editing the files in another app later on.<br/>
<br/>
For this request, the implementation can be minimal at first:<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
The Nomad app only shows sheet layers when opening a document. You can enter the viewport&#39;s annotations and measure the elements shown in the viewport. you can also add some simple annotations like call outs and revision clouds. These annotation can be saved in the Vectorworks file.<br/>
<br/>
This can be already very useful for for example an iPad on a construction site without the need for converting to PDF&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
In a later stage, maybe functionalities to read object info can be implemented.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand this won&#39;t be possible on all hardware, but f.e. iPads with a M1 or M2 processor do have the required hardware for opening (and even editing) Vectorworks files. They just don&#39;t have the required software. This functionalities can be limited to M-series products in the first stage, if that makes this enhancement more realistic.<br/>
<br/>
In a final stage, it might be even possible to install Vectorworks (with an adapted interface) on a tablet with compatible hardware. This may sound like a crazy idea to product specialists like us, but to some users this sounds like a logical next step. And maybe they are not completely wrong.

Luckily, as product specialists, we know you can turn off this setting. Unfortunately, most customers don&#39;t, so just keep on being irritated by this (and irritated customers are not a good thing). When we show any customer (without exception) that you can check off this setting, we make their day. This shows that the fact that this option is checked on by default is just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
To undo views, you can always use the previous and next arrows in the view bar. So there&#39;s absolutely no reason left to keep this option checked on by default.

We see a lot of cases on our technical support where users don&#39;t find an eligible back up file after a crash and the default settings are usually to blame. Underneath you can find the settings we usually propose to our customers:<br/>
<br/>
- Frequency of savings: every 15 minutes is sometimes too long. every (for example) 25 operations says more about the maximum amount of work someone would lose in case of a crash.<br/>
<br/>
- &quot;confirm before save&quot; is unnecessary. Many users click &quot;no&quot; without reading the alert, which means no backup file<br/>
<br/>
- It is safer to save the back ups to a custom location. Documents is fine, because most users (unless they have an extremely paranoia IT service, it happens) do have sufficient permissions for that. This is sometimes not the case on the servers and clouds the original file is saved. Also, autosaving via unstable or slow connections to a server can cause slowness and instabilities (crash) in Vectorworks. Another advantage: cleaning up your computer gets easier. With one button you can delete all the back ups.<br/>
<br/>
- More that one back up is necessary. Many users have the reflex to open the original file after a crash before opening a back up. In this way, the only back up gets overwritten very easily with a version with lost information. More back ups give more room mistakes. Also, when a file gets corrupted, more back ups means more chance there&#39;s still a non- corrupted version available. I usually propose to keep 3 back ups.

 * The internal origin is very important for Vectorworks&#39; functionality. The further from the internal origin, the less accurate the display of objects and geometric calculations will be. especially after importing a DWG, it is very important to check to not have objects located too far from this origin.<br/>
At tech support, we see a lot of issues after a DWG import, because the internal origin is located far away.<br/>
 * When you&#39;re working with geolocation, you will be working with the internal origin. Whenever you exit the geolocation tool, your sense of location suddenly becomes very abstract when the origin marker is not shown. Also, for a user who is just beginning with GIS, it can be easier to set everything correctly if he/she is familiar with the internal origin already.<br/>
Because beginning GIS users today don&#39;t know anything about how origin&#39;s actually functions in Vectorworks and don&#39;t understand the importance of it, we see a lot of wrong workflows amongst our users. An always- visible internal origin can make it easier for us to educate them.<br/>
 * It can have kind of an &quot;educational&quot; advantage. Because it is visible, people will have questions about it and will learn what is is about exactly and why it is important.

The this setting can be increased 100. I&#39;m not sure why 20 is used by default, but I guess it is to avoid to run into hardware limits. In the mean time, though, Vectorworks requires at minimum 8GB of RAM anyway. I think (with my limited knowledge about this subject) that 100 undo&#39;s will be fine on a machine with 8GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
In short: I suspect that the default limit of 20 undo&#39;s in the Vectorworks preferences is based on old hardware restrictions and today it should be safe to turn this number up to 100.

Same goes for viewport visibility. Classes and layers are searchable. <br/>
But I found that a place where a search field is missing is for saved views. Saved views are extremely important for production and presentation of a project. These contain, a view, a rendering style, classes and layers visibility, but these last are not searchable. And when dealing with a 100 classes and 50 layers is just not easy to find anything. Time consuming. lots of scrolling. <br/>
I believe a search field for saved views will be more than welcome by users.

I understand this is a limitation to keep the rendering time as low as possible, so I understand that objects which are not in your view are not reflected. But I think the hidden surfaces of the visible objects should be included. At this moment, reflections sometimes look very weird because only some &quot;floating&quot; surface is reflected.

<br/>
It would be far more efficient, if you could edit and create resources directly where you need them. So whenever you open the resource browser anywhere within Vectorworks, you should be able to edit and create resources of the corresponding type, like you can do it in the resource manager itself.<br/>

One of the attached videos shows how you can edit materials directly from editing the wall type without the need to open the material manager.

 * editing poly&#39;s boundaries by choosing a line of another object in the drawing with the first click and a side of the poly with a second click<br/>
 * Just aligning solitary objects<br/>

But one type of interaction which is missing, is the roof adapting to wall displacements, like slabs do.<br/>
<br/>
When you displace one of the walls defining the roof&#39;s edge, there should be an option for the roof&#39;s edge should displace together with the wall.<br/>
<br/>
A proposition more in detail:<br/>
<br/>
I know the comparison with slabs can&#39;t be 100 percent accurate, since there&#39;s an important difference in behavior: Whenever you link a slab with a random geometry to walls, the slab&#39;s geometry will adapt to the walls. With roofs, the roof will interact with the walls, but keep its original footprint. So maybe we can work with a check box in the OIP &quot;adapt roof&#39;s footprint to walls&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
- In case the roof is created by the walls, this checkbox should be automatically on. displacing the wall will affect the roof&#39;s footprint. Unchecking the checkbox would mean that the roof is still linked to the wall (wall and roof components can still interact), but the roof&#39;s footprint will not adapt to the wall&#39;s boundary.<br/>
<br/>
- In case the roof is linked manually to the walls after the roof is created, this checkbox will be checked off by default. The roof&#39;s footprint will not change. whenever you check the checkbox, the the roof&#39;s geometry adapt to the linked walls. From on that moment, the roof adapts to wall displacements<br/>

A tolerance should be implemented: the model should intersect the layer at least a little more before walls are created for that layer.

The command &quot;model to floorplan&quot; seldomly produces the desired result.<br/>
<br/>
In the video underneath, you see how it is very easy to pick faces of a conceptual mass and convert them to walls in Revit. This has the next advantages compared to the &quot;model to floorplan&quot; command in Vectorworks:<br/>
- The walls follow the top and bottom form of the volume<br/>
- No accidental walls are created, because the model touches the elevation height of the next design layer<br/>
- The user can decide which walls are created<br/>
- The workflow is more intuitive and direct<br/>
- Walls are created sloped when the model&#39;s face does have a slope (see VE-104771)<br/>
<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nhXgg7zwAw<br/>
<br/>
Since Vectorworks&#39; visibility settings are layer based, it might be imported to add an extra mode to limit the wall&#39;s height at maximum to the bounds defined in the style related to the active layer. So the wall will follow the face&#39;s top and bottom form, but will be topped off if the face exceeds the limits of the bounds defined by the wall&#39;s top and bottom bound settings. The wall for the level above, you can create by picking the same face while another layer is active.

Ultimately existing trees should be styled like other objects to allow selection and placement of an object that already has the necessary data associated with it. In many cases, when using this tool many of the existing trees will be quite similar, and styles would make it easier to manage and assign that data.

The function we want is similar how a Wall functions with Windows or other Objects inserted. Needed would be a Flag you can set for a PIO that looks for StoryBounded Objects inside it, like the Wall does. With that we could define a PIO that Groups Objects similar to a Wall and support Stories for the Subobjects of this PIO.<br/>
This would also be a good feature for PIOs like the Slab, if it has modifier objects that are story aware. Or its components like the wall does.<br/>
 <br/>
Use Case:<br/>
We have 2 PIOs: Electrical Installations and Electrical Components. <br/>
For Electrical Installations it is useful to have multiple Storys where the Electrical Components are. For Example all Outlets should be near the Top of Footing where as Light Switches should be on Top of Parapet. All of these Compontents can be Grouped up by a Electrical Installations. Currently we use a workaround to Position those Components in an Electrical Installation.<br/>
 <br/>
Another use case would be for holes or breakthroughs in Slabs. So that modifier objects in the slab only create a hole as far down as its associated story.

 * In some cases it is difficult or impossible to link slabs to walls. This can be because the specific situation in the design or because of the many bugs with slab- wall links<br/>
 * It is very hard to maintain the closed boundary at all times during the modeling process. This leads to the necessity to create slabs again very often. Also bugs come in here to complicate and make everything unpredictable.<br/>
 * Interior walls can&#39;t be linked to a slab which spans the whole building. this makes it difficult to link slab and interior wall components in a correct way.<br/>
<br/>
If it will be possible to link slabs to individual walls, many of these and similar issues could be solved.<br/>

<br/>
_&quot;Passing along some thoughts. I have struggled a bit with managing seeded areas via Landscape Area objects. We will generally show these as a hatched area, and our schedule will list square footage and refer to the appropriate seed mix specification. If I wanted to generate a table, I could use the plants per square foot parameter with a Seed Mix Plant Style Record and Seed Mix Landscape Area Record for the additional parameters we’d want to input (it is common for us to have a plug/container and seed version of a plant in our projects, so we need multiple plant styles). However, this presents challenges with visualization – with seeds, I do not want any 2D plant appearance because they wind up in dwg exports and clutter the drawing. In 3D, if I use the plants/sf parameter it will make the planting way too dense. I am leaning toward using a custom record format for all seed-related info so that the plant object parameters are strictly for basic plant info and visualization. What I don’t like about this is that the record information doesn’t stick with the plant style and I’d have to place an individual plant somewhere to edit values, then clean up the worksheet. This all being said it would be great to see more tools to control the appearance and documentation of landscape areas for seeding.&quot;_<br/>

Resolving these issues by editing the model or using class overrides or data visualization can be a very labor- intensive work (and doesn&#39;t always guarantee success). It would be useful, if there was a way to individually select the lines within a viewport with a hidden line render and change their attributes for that specific viewport.<br/>
<br/>
See in the attached video how easily line attributes are changed in an elevation view in Revit. Rather than resolving the issue in the model, unwanted lines are made invisible by simply selecting those lines and changing their line type. The downspout which has a dotted line because of its 2D properties, can be easily changed to a full line for the elevation.

Maybe the viewport&#39;s poly cache can be &quot;editable&quot; to remove visibility of edges/vertices.<br/>
<br/>
These changes would be lost when the viewport is re-rendered however. The more general solution might entail customizable &quot;looks&quot; for specific objects, though that might need to add reference-able data on objects.

Since a sheet can show a huge variety of views via viewports, it would be preferable when viewing a sheet in a multi-view pane to only display the name of the sheet (as is shown in the image above, to the right of the words &quot;top/plan&quot; in each pane&#39;s title).<br/>

!Screen Shot 2023-06-15 at 2.57.04 pm.png|width=330,height=309!<br/>
<br/>
Every architect that does accessible housing here uses this feature, however we are planning for the gradual retirement of WinDoor in favour of the Door and Window tools. As part of this transition, I am programming a Vectorscript plug-in that can be overlaid on and associated with a Door object. It is called Accessibility Overlay.<br/>
<br/>
This is all doable now except that an association cannot currently trigger a reset if the parent object (the Door) is reset. This is very desirable in this case so that if the Door is resized, moved or rotated, the associated Accessibility Overlay can reset to accommodate the changes. <br/>
<br/>
The AddAssociation therefore needs three additional boolean arguments: <br/>
 * Reset on parent reset<br/>
 * Reset on parent move<br/>
 * Reset on parent rotate<br/>
<br/>
Something like this would do the trick:<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0000FF}FUNCTION {color}AddAssociationN(<br/>
      ioOwnerObj : {color:#0000FF}HANDLE{color};<br/>
      inKind : {color:#0000FF}INTEGER{color};<br/>
      EditReset : {color:#0000FF}BOOLEAN{color};<br/>
      MoveReset : {color:#0000FF}BOOLEAN{color};<br/>
      RotateReset : {color:#0000FF}BOOLEAN{color};<br/>
      ioTargetObj : {color:#0000FF}HANDLE{color}) : {color:#0000FF}BOOLEAN{color};<br/>
<br/>
I am sure there would be benefits for other users with the addition of this functionality also. Thanks.

<br/>
some programs (Adobe, Affinity, ...) that I use have a shortcut,<br/>
to hide all menus with just one tap. In VW you have this option too.<br/>
<br/>
This is useful when you want to present your designs to a client.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to extend this behavior further and think we need more than<br/>
two states (all menus / no menus) for this feature.<br/>
<br/>
Three states make more sense:<br/>
<br/>
- all menus<br/>
- selectable menus<br/>
- no menus<br/>
<br/>
With status 2 you have the possibility to choose which menu is visible.<br/>
e.g. for a presentation it can be useful that the layer and class menu<br/>
are visible on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings<br/>

<br/>
It would be good to use more colour coding. Circuit links teal as they are, then borrow the orange from the public roadmap task cards for equipment to keep it on-brand, and then device connections as grey? I think this will build some mental links to those colours which will improve the UX of navigating a design you don&#39;t yet know.<br/>

Comment Stefan Bender:<br/>
<br/>
The plug-in stores the indices unless you specify a custom thickness. This is WAD. You can argue about if it makes sense, but that workflow was decided in the very beginning many years ago when we started supporting graphical attributes for our objects. Changing this behaviour would affect a lot of our other PIOs and objects. While data conversion would hopefully not cause the actual line thicknesses to change, the behaviour when copying objects to other documents would change. We would also need to change some internal data structures and the behavior of some dialog controls thus risking regression bugs. A VE definitely makes sense so our architects and others could discuss the pros and cons. Such a major change can not be done for VW 2024 as it is too late in the project cycle.

                Speaker and Speaker-Array Tools VERY VERY important improvements
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We use speaker and speaker-array tools every day with more than 100 users. We&#39;ve got many restrictions with those 2 tools, mainly when using with symbols instead catalog mode. Symbols are really important to have correct geometry. Here are our problems with those tools :<br/>
 * Speaker-array tools is unworkable with symbols. When array is populated, then you can&#39;t easily move array, or do anything else, because it seems hat this tools draw new 2D geometry permanently. A solution will be to don&#39;t use 2D and use only 3D when speakers inside array are angled. Like Truss tools. You can have hundreds of truss angled and easy to move<br/>
 * Speaker array files are too much big. Here attached files example. One set with 4 configurations : Speaker-Array-Catalog no populated = 17,1Mo, catalog populated = 17,8Mo, speaker-array symbols no populated = 123,1Mo, symbols populated = 1,79Go (I can&#39;t upload it, too big) !!!!<br/>
 * We need to have our yoke, with correct geometry, and with real insert point. Now, the insert point is systematically at the center of the speaker, but that&#39;s not right in many real speakers. There is usually a Y/Z shift. Real yoke is very important to have corect geometry with scenography, decoration, ...<br/>
 * Same thing, we need to put our correct tripod with real geometry<br/>
 * sometimes we need to have specific shift between speakers in array<br/>
 * When a speaker is used with a yoke, the weight doesn&#39;t change. It will be very important for braceworks calculation when we will able to put our correct yoke with symbol<br/>
 * Speaker-Array tool is limiting global angle to 90°. We often use array with more than 90°<br/>
 * Many often we have a second bumper in line-array but not the same than the first. Actually the tool is limited to 1 sort of bumper. I have a tip, I duplicated all my bumper and modified them as speakers. So I can insert them between 2 speakers in array (but then limited to 2 sort of speakers instead of 3). We need to have more than one bumper sort in an array.<br/>
 * A tip to have correct yoke is to use speaker-array instead speaker for one speaker+yoke. But then when you angle the speaker, the alignment with the yoke is moving. So that tip isn&#39;t efficient.

<br/>
Circuit segregation is important whether we are designing containment ourselves or communicating to an M&amp;E contractor who will be designing the containment systems.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, this is working OK for us as a custom field in a record, but as it is universally applicable, I feel it would be worth some consideration for the stock deployment.<br/>
<br/>
At a minimum, we would separate circuits in to &#39;ELV&#39; and &#39;LV&#39; (i.e. Band I and Band II), but on larger projects this would be more granular. See examples below.<br/>
<br/>
Where possible, I&#39;m hesitant to give our users more and more fields to fill in. So in this case, I&#39;m using the data manager to lookup the containment required based on the signal type chosen, which will assign the containment to the &#39;default&#39; containment class. The user can override this per-circuit in the Data pane if they know better.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if the Source and Destination rack/drop point for the circuit are the same, the containment always calculates to &#39;—&#39;. Reports grouped by containment class are then possible, filtering out cables without a named containment.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-07-21-14-51-23-849.png!<br/>
<br/>
A worksheet allows the user to select the project default containment class for each signal type.<br/>

<br/>
Above general use for filtering, filtering out False records is used for producing a cable schedule for pre-wiring racks that are built off-site. Filtering out True records is helpful for sizing and planning containment.<br/>
<br/>
It is also a very useful field to run data vis on when checking through a schematic.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t instantly think of a particular reason it would function better as a stock field than a custom field, but as a point of development for the future, I feel it would be useful as part of the stock deployment.

The solution we got from them (not sure if this is good enough) is to show the &quot;Quality&quot; column in the filtered list as well. Then you at least get a better idea which one you want to use.<br/>

It would be great to merge the Title Block Manager Sets and the Publish Sets. I know, Publish can also be used for layouts without a title block and saved views. Nevertheless, it would be great if the two functions could use the same sets. <br/>

                Support of Building wing (tract)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      It would be fantastic if Vectorworks is able to handle building wings (tract) more efficient and user friendly in their workflow.<br/>
<br/>
*Use case:*<br/>
<br/>
Actually a building wing (tract) can be handled already today in Vectorworks by defining different level types for each tract. Well, this is actually called a split level situation. But defining and handling different level types for individual building wings that are not on the same level but on the same story is a kind of nightmare. In that case you do not only need to handle different levels types but also different content (walls, slabs..) for each building wing. Designing and handling this complex document structure and content is challenging and error prone.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Rough idea:*<br/>
<br/>
A rough idea is that the story and level type definition support a kind of sub-structure for building wings (tract). Actually it’s just a kind of tract name than could have a kind of offset from the story base level. The defined level types could be assigned to a tract. Then the defined level types just add or substract this offset from their defined hight. Well, as I wrote these are just rough thought and it might be that the level types assigned to a tract just have the same name but individual hight…<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In addition to this additional structure in the story/leve definition it should be possible to define graphical areas in the document (a kind of polygon) that encloses a building wing (tract). Objects like walls, slabs, symbols that have level type definition assigned should know in which building wing (tract) they are created and use the correct bounding. In that way you can avoid creating content for each tract and the user don’t have to handle level types in individually for each object.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Conclusion:*<br/>
<br/>
This would be a huge benefit to the customer, simplify the document structure an streamline their workflow.<br/>
<br/>
The good thing about this feature is that it does not affect IFC export a lot as long as we do not also support the handling of multiple buildings in one file. As you probably know we also have the wish that Vectorworks can handle multiple buildings in one file. If we could handle multiple buildings using references we would be already a big step forward. But maybe the first step could be to support building wings first.

<br/>
The best practice workflow is to model every building in a separate files and then create a Vectorworks master file that references the individual buildings and then contains objects that are common for the entire project (e.g. an underground garage). Because Vectorworks IFC also doesn&#39;t support multiple buildings you in addition have to IFC export then every building individually (can&#39;t use the master file) and merge the buildings with a model checker. <br/>
 * It would be great if it’s possible to export all buildings directly from the master file without the need to merge the buildings afterwards with a model checker.<br/>
 * Also the rotation (north direction), height above sea level and the world coordinates of the buildings need to be considered<br/>
 * Export should have the correct entities ifcProject, ifcSite, ifcBuilding, Stories<br/>
 * It’s still quite complicated to reference resources over multiple files. It would be great, to have more control over referenced resources. E.g. where is the resource coming from, new resources can only be added in a resource file to avoid duplicated resources, new resources in the resources file will automatically be referenced in other files etc.<br/>
 * Use of Data Tags on Section with referenced objects (CWE02939)<br/>

Unfortunately the task do only address Classification. We actually hope that in the future we can use an excel sheet/worksheet to add „automated“ information to all objects and properties and can get rid of the complex condition formulas and mapping formulas in Data manager. It should be possible to „search“ for object information (each line in Excel is actually a kind of search criteria) and add any additional data to building elements by using these rules.<br/>
<br/>
Example Given: <br/>
Search for a Space with the name „Office“ and automatically write „Main Usable Area“ into „ifcCategory“. This information is not a Classification in DACH it has to be written into ifcCategory.<br/>
or<br/>
Search for an interior wall that is load bearing and add a fire rating „EI 90“.<br/>
<br/>
It should also be possible to change ifcEntity using the same or similar system.<br/>
<br/>
Example Given:<br/>
Search for a component material „Insulation“ and change the component entity to „ifcCovering“.<br/>
or<br/>
Search for the sub-part of a window „sill“ and change the entity to „ifcCovering“.<br/>
<br/>
These are just two examples to mention once more, that building components and sub-parts should be supported.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the wish is to extend the automated classification mapping we hopefully get in 2025 (T02407) to any object and data inside Vectorworks.<br/>

Solibri has a powerful system how to assign data  (tag) to any entity by defining a kind of excel table.

Examples of tasks that could be done in the background: data exchange (IFC/DWG export etc.), Update library, batch conversion, update references, publish, avoid complete crashes etc.<br/>
<br/>
Usecase 1:<br/>
The user starts Vectorworks and just after starting the update library message pops up. To save time (the user already needed to wait until VW started), the user skips the library update. Because his team members worked on the library in the workgroup folder, the user realize the changes until he finally makes the library update. If the team member continousliy improve the library every day. The library update needs to be done also every day. If this is done automatically (maybe with an intervall) in the background, the time until the user can start working will be reduced a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Usecase 2:<br/>
Depending on the amount of objects and also the 3D resolution the IFC export can take a long time. The unofficial current workaround of power users is now to run several instances of VW. So one of them can be used for the IFC export while in the other the user can still continue working.<br/>
If exports (not just IFC) would run in the background, the user could already continue working.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, ArchiCAD is running a hidden application/service called ArchiCAD helper. We think that this is a kind of ArchiCAD Version running in the background and is doing a lot of these background stuff. We also think that this service also takes care if ArchiCAD crash. Often there is no data loss and the last version of the file automatically opens again. But it’s a guess that this service is handling this in ArchiCAD.

<br/>
For this reason, there should exist an option (f.e. with a check box) to always force the border&#39;s alignment with the bottom of the main area&#39;s slap, no matter the main area&#39;s datum settings.

<br/>
These two settings almost always need to be changed by the user after creating the hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
Better default settings would be:<br/>
 -The hardscape should have &quot;slab&quot; as 3D by default. Users with a 2D workflow usually use poly&#39;s in stead of hardscapes. And if they happen to use hardscapes, they are not bothered by the 3D part either. No 3D by default is complicating things unnecessarily. Adding 3D by default is the right way to go (just like we changed that for stairs a few years ago).<br/>
- The component in the slab should have its datum on the &quot;top of component&quot;. This makes more sense in most cases.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The shaded render mode become better and better and is a fantastic help during design. We think that some of this innovation should be brought to Renderworks too. Our rendering expert did some render tests using different „anti-alising“  settings and got the following results:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You’ll find 2 medium sized Vectorworks files attached with the results:<br/>
<br/>
Example 1: medium 30sec high 48sec very high 713sec<br/>
<br/>
Example 2: medium 1:25min high 4:11min very high 48min<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: between medium and high we see a huge difference in render time but actually a small difference in render quality. We think the render time cannot be that long and you do not get a much better result at the end. Generally we think that the possibility and the render quality of the Cineware engine can be much better. Today users expect the quality to be as good as in a realtime renderer or even better. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, we don’t know if it’s a limitation of the Cinerender engine, a bad material library, a lack of our own know-ledge or the default settings that we are offering in the render settings are no longer state of the art. We haven&#39;t seen stunning rendering from Vectorworks, Inc. neither… well, we mean really stunning images :):D. However, our update movies always look great and they were also created with C4D. Althought we don’t know if there is another render engine behind the final renderings.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our expert that also teaching interior design classes see high quality renderings from SketchUp every day. Well, these were probably done with the V-Ray plug in but this is actually the quality users would expect when waiting for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here are a few links:<br/>
<br/>
[https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJVFBBoL/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is another example of how Sketchup has integrated AI for renderings:<br/>
<br/>
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CteYNsyAYD3/?igshid=ZmZiYTY5ZDNhOA==<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, we don’t know exactly how we should formulate this wish. We think the render result (out of the box) should be better than it is now and the difference between the render options Vectorworks use must not take so much render time if the image will not be much much better. Maybe it’s already good enough to consider to optimize the default settings behind the Renderworks options or offer better textures.

Whenever you will displace the grid line, the wall will displace together with the wall. Also walls on other levels, which are locked to the grid, will move together with the grid line (unfortunately, this is not demonstrated in the video, but it is mentioned in Dutch).<br/>
This has the advantage that the grid lines don&#39;t only serve a purpose as annotations on a finished model, but can be used as a design tool which allows for easy modifications.<br/>
<br/>
This enhancement request is, of course, a request for a similar functionality within Vectorworks.

                Roof improvements
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      _We&#39;ve already talked about this a lot and you&#39;ll also find this high rated wish on our CW wishlist for Architect, but we&#39;ve never reported it in JIRA. Now in this report we have compiled everything about the roof:_<br/>
<br/>
It is very cumbersome and often impossible to create the roof even of standard buildings. The user often has to switch to model the parts of the roof instead of using the roof tool. For smaller firms, who are the largest share of Computerworks&#39; customers, a pitched roof is a key BIM element. This is why the deficits of the roof tool contribute disproportionately to how the BIM capability of Vectorworks is perceived by this user group. It is often used as evidence, that Vectorworks is not really a qualified BIM tool. <br/>
It would be great if a bundle of improvements could be implemented (same as for walls and slabs), including roof windows and dormers:<br/>
 # Users want to show outlines, dormers, windows to be displayed as dashed/dotted in floor plans below the roof.<br/>
 # Walls of dormers are created by the dormer object. The same functionality of the wall tool is required for dormer walls: components, BIM data (Exterior, load bearing etc.), render materials etc. Components of dormer walls should be able to be joined with roof components.<br/>
 # More BIM data for the roof object and its components.<br/>
 # Better quantity takeoff functionality<br/>
 # It would be great if roof components could be joined with adjacent wall components individually just as wall components can be joined by using a component join tool. <br/>
This should be in line with our wish &quot;Walls: Individual handling of wall components in 2D and 3D&quot;.<br/>
 # Additional to parametric design, the possibility of modelling roof faces separately as 3D polygons or volumes and then joining them (in 2D-Plan, Section and Perspective) could be an intuitive solution to create complex roof geometry. <br/>
 # Connecting with interior and exterior walls is problematic. Interior walls connect to other components than exterior walls. Often a second &quot;imaginary&quot; roof must be created, with which interior walls can then be clipped. Problem otherwise is that the inner roof components do NOT run to the exterior walls. When connected with the roof, the interior and exterior walls are treated the same but they have to be treated differently.<br/>
 # It would be nice if dormers could be created without having to insert a window placed inside a symbol. Converting polygons from ground view could be a solution.<br/>
 # It would be nice if dormers could be moved by using the move by points tool or by drag and drop.<br/>
 # It would be nice if windows inside dormers could be moved and edited just as normal windows.<br/>
 # Transforming point clouds from laser scanners into Vectorworks BIM objects, is possibly a very different workflow to how our users want to create roofs in Vectorworks. Maybe this workflow can also be taken into account when enhancing the tool.<br/>
 # We also think, the roof should be a tool and not a command to make it better visible and on the same level like walls and slabs.<br/>
 # All common roof shapes should be possible. See PDF with examples attached: &quot;Dach.pdf&quot; with common roofs from the DACH region.<br/>
 # Roof should support detail levels like the walls.<br/>

<br/>
We know that this is already on your radar but I would like to mention that it becomes more and more prominent.<br/>
<br/>
Here a couple of requirements that could be part of the task..<br/>
1. Possibility to open/import IDS xml in Data Manager<br/>
2. Indication which IFC entity was part of the IDS (was possible in the past already)<br/>
3. Create a Vectorworks data set for each entity with the properties that was included in the IDS<br/>
4. Add custom pSets define in IDS to the correct IFC entity<br/>
5. Create enumeration entries in Data Manager with the allowed values (no more mistakes)<br/>
6. Offer a simple way to only export IFC properties that are part of IDS<br/>
7. Allow import of multiple IDS<br/>
8. Add the predefined classification if available<br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
We hope that IDS is implemented in the 2024 cycle :)

I think there should be an &#39;External Connection&#39; tag on the Equipment entry for Externals. I don&#39;t think &#39;External&#39; is clear enough for an average wireperson - external to what? &#39;External Connection&#39; or similar would be better.

When you create a Geoimage the process of creating the &quot;preview&quot; after the image is created use a lot of time and in this time Vectorworks is blocked. You can switch the tool, but you have to wait toll the invisible &quot;preview process&quot; is finished.<br/>

Now the difficulties are if the users want to show the value togehter with the correct abbreviation definition, the abbreviation needs to be inserted as static text in the Data Tags or Elevation Bechmark objects.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if the correct abbreviation could be chosen from a list of official abbreviations and saved in the document. The chosen abbreviation could then be a value for Data Tags and Elevation Benchmark too.

Logic (for western readers at least who read left to right) would dictate that the object&#39;s style should be chosen (or visually confirmed when reading the mode bar line) _before_ the object is inserted. Therefore, I propose that the object style dropdown menu be located to the *left* of the insertion modes. <br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Following installation VW requires activation before anything else can be done.  The current activation process does not include a way for the user to first select a custom user folder location so the activation file can be saved in the desired location.  <br/>
<br/>
For existing users of a previous version this becomes an issue as they are more than likely going to be converting a previous user folder and often use the migration manager to do so. This creates a pain point where it forces a user to activate the installation twice.   The first time VW uses the default user folder location and when the user attempts to select a new user folder location VW will need to activate again because the user will not want to choose to copy the default user folder contents to their custom location for fear of loosing preferences or customized files they are bringing forward.  This process gets more difficult when the user has more than on installation.   <br/>
<br/>
For example, I have two computers that run VW and I use a single user/workgroup folder so all the content is shared.  After installing VW on one computer I migrated the user folder contents to the current version and then later installed VW on the other.  Each required 2 activations using up 4 total activations.  It&#39;s both an unnecessary extra step in the installation process and can potentially leave the user without enough activations should any number of problems occur that require reinstallation or re-activation.  These occurrences never happen at a convenient time potentially leaving the user without the ability to use VW for a critical period of time.  Rather than increasing the allowed activations for an installation it would be most user friendly to simply allow the user the opportunity to select a user folder prior to activation.

Depending on the complexity of a building updating a section viewport can take several minutes. When switching to a layer with section viewports the user first has to update the sections and has to wait until the are finished (user still able to work since the process will be done in the background). Sections are often used to control the &quot;work&quot; and are helpful to understand the building better therfore it should be as fast as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We wish that section viewports (and of course other viewports as well) can be updated in the background.<br/>
A solution would be to provide an option for every viewport to update manually, with a specific interval automatically or when opening a document.

The users need to know that they have to increase the DPI value. In all our template documents the preset Sheet Layers are already prepared with 300dpi.<br/>
<br/>
In very few cases the computer doesn&#39;t manage 300dpi or it would take too long for rendering. In this case the user can reduce the DPI manually.<br/>
<br/>
We recommend that also new Sheet Layers should have 300dpi. With this action, we make it easier for the user to have a good looking result/rendering with fewer clicks and necessairy settings.

The problem occurs when there are other short key combinations using &quot;z&quot;. E.g. cmd + z for Undo. If now the user clicks a wrong short key combination, he wonders why nothing happened and clicks the combination twice. As a result the snapping is suspended permanently and the user complains about the accuracy of drawing with VW because there is no snapping anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking a wrong short key combination can happen often when switching between Mac and Windows (e.g. in Classroom environment, Homeoffice computers etc). CTRL + Z = Undo on Windows BUT CTRL + Z on Mac twice = snapping suspended permanently.<br/>
<br/>
This problem would be solved if suspend snapping (and maybe also other short keys) work only if exactly the defined key is pressed:<br/>
<br/>
&lt; = suspend snapping <br/>
<br/>
CTRL + &lt; = Nothing happens (Mac) except this exact short key combination is defined for some command or tool<br/>

*{color:#de350b}Problems:{color}* the shorthand Pipe causes problems for translating and localizing documentation and user interface strings in the languages served by Vectorworks. The translators have to rely heavily on visual and text context to ensure that the following UI items are translated properly: Pipe, Draw Pipe (Pipe section of the OIP), Pipe (under Classes in the OIP). As it stands, Pipe could mean either lighting pipe or lighting pipe ladder (two different lighting devices and tools).<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the Pipe term could be easily confused with the Pipe command for irrigation and in other areas of Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
{color:#4c9aff}*Recommended solutions:* {color}spell out Pipe in the appropriate tool. For example, in the Lighting Pipe tool, Pipe should be Lighting pipe, Draw Pipe should be Draw Lighting Pipe and Pipe (classes) should be Lighting Pipe. In the Lighting Pipe Ladder tool, Pipe should be Lighting pipe ladder, Draw Pipe should be Draw Lighting Pipe Ladder and Pipe (classes) should be Lighting Pipe Ladder.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure that the UI item *Pipe* only refers to pipe for irrigation, plumbing or similar purposes outside of Spotlight, Braceworks or lighting design.

There should be a way to add wall components which are stacked horizontally on top or underneath other wall components. Users struggle with f.e. exterior plinths, because now the plinth needs to be a separate wall. This means that users need to be creative with their wall openings (1 object can just open 1 wall) and plinths (and their openings) need to be moved separately when there&#39;s an adjustment to the design.<br/>

There can be an option to add components horizontally in a wall style.<br/>

Archicad allows you to draw the vertical section of the wall. A visual editor for the wall style could be a potential path. Editing can be done in the drawing space.

I filed a bug originally with this observation but it came back as WAD hence this VE. <br/>
<br/>
It seems very odd that Viewport Styles when created are placed at the root level of the Resource Manager (RM) and not automatically placed into their own Resource folder. <br/>
<br/>
Other items are placed into their own folders: Date Tags; Title Block Borders; Section-Elevation Lines; Hardscape Styles; Hatches (if from objects like hardscapes); Textures (if from objects like hardscapes) etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
In a file I have been working on it was difficult to find the Viewport Styles until I filtered them in the pull down menu at the top of the RM. It seems inconsistent that they are not automatically organised into their own resource folder hence the VE.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

<br/>
A customer suggested maybe having a toggle button to turn the corner truss the right way. A shortcut-button that cycles through the possible rotations of your truss corner/cross.

For example: If you have a building with a staircase you want to create a clip cube along the stair edge to analyze the staircase. This is pretty easy if the stair is horizontally or vertically. But it&#39;s not that easy if the staircase has another rotation in the building. In that case you have to rotate the clip cube in a second step. That can be challenging in a complex building.<br/>
<br/>
It would be perfect if the clip cube can be created in a kind of top plan view and you can define the clip cube like a rectangle or even directly a rotated rectangle. ArchiCAD in that case just create a clip cube through the whole building in that case.<br/>
<br/>
Defining a clip cube at the right position and angle would be easier and faster. See also attached movie.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
with the &quot;Connect CombineTool&quot; you can connect<br/>
fast and easy, two roof objects to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Some roof-connections you can achieve with this tool<br/>
are complex.<br/>
<br/>
If connections of complex geometry is possible<br/>
inside Vectorworks, I would like to see this technology<br/>
also for other object-combinations.<br/>
<br/>
What is NOT possible at the moment with &quot;Connect Combine&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
- connecting a roof to a solid, or another 3d-object<br/>
- connecting other objects than the roof-object<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To plan an underground parking the user starts with the excavation in the terrain model around the shape of the underground building part. The problem occurs when the structure of the bulding is drawn and the user wants to fill the space between the roof of the underground building part to the proposed terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Most users either use another terrain model, the softscapes or hardscapes. The problem that often can&#39;t be solved in this case, is the levelling layer directly above the underground garage. This layer is usually geometrically different from the upper layers. It should be possible to control this compensation layer either manually or with an automatic adjustment function. With the terrain model layers there is already the possibility to work with the geological points, which could be a manual solution.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great, to have a function where you can define a certain layer (e.g. the lowest) that should automatically adjust to the object below/above it. The following example probably describes the issue best. If a stepped underground car park is to be created and a topography is to be created above it, then the terrain model should be able to adapt to the underground car park surface. This would allow the spaces in between to be filled. These areas are especially relevant for large projects and must therefore be possible.<br/>
<br/>
On the construction site this levelling layer is added after the constuctions of the underground building / garage and therefore the quantities of the required filling material is needed.<br/>
<br/>

Windows 11&#39;s aesthetics for dialog are more elegant and modern, so I think we should integrate it in the Vectorworks interface. Below I show 3 different versions of the organization dialog:<br/>
- The organization dialog how it currently looks like in Vectorworks 2023: The edges and buttons follow the Windows 11 aesthetics with rounded corners and smooth shadows, but the other elements inside the dialog look very Windows 95- like (dubble contrasty edges, outdated &quot;3D&quot; effects) <br/>
- The content of the current 2024 Beta looks a lot more modern and soft for the eyes, but for its edges and buttons it uses sharp corners end very hard, dark and sharp shadows, which look outdated<br/>
- The last screenshot, I assembled myself. I try to illustrate here how the 2024 interface could look like with windows 11 aesthetics. It is off course a rough sketch of what it could be. I know this is rather about taste than functionality, but I think this might look more modern and less agressive.

The water drop analysis or also rainwater analysis is about creating a water analysis for certain situations. Thus, for example, possible areas for flooding can be detected. Civil can already do this, it is also described in their manual:<br/>
<br/>
[https://help.autodesk.com/view/CIV3D/2024/ENG/?guid=GUID-0A52A24C-D6A9-4005-AF35-842A8309D167]<br/>
<br/>
A water drop analysis shows the course of water on the terrain model and is used for water analysis. For example, a 2D or 3D polyline is drawn that represents a water course, and labels.<br/>

According to Gabe&#39;s comment in VB-188680, this is happening due to the way we apply story bounds in Top/Plan, and it&#39;s technically WAD.<br/>

This is something that seems like it should work from a user&#39;s perspective and feels kind of awkward, but if it&#39;s not possible it might make sense to just hide (or gray-out) the &quot;Pitch&quot; field in the data bar when in Top/Plan.<br/>

<br/>
When you set the view bar in compact mode, though, things are getting a bit crammed. A lot of precious space seems to be consumed by the text settings, while more &quot;real&quot; Vectorworks functionalities, like for example classes and layers, are getting a very small area.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a good idea to display the text settings more compact in compact mode, by just displaying the &quot;Aa&quot; icon. When you click on this icon, all settings which are now displayed in the view bar, can be found in the pop over. In this way, more space can be assigned for the other items in the view bar.

We could offer the possibility in a more &quot;offical&quot; way. A possibility could be, to offer it as a method of the modifier tool or even as a stand-alone tool Terrain Modifier (Simple).

We would appreciate another behavior. User one has Vectorworks in use and user two tries to start Vectorworks with the same number.

User one should also get a message that someone, maybe here too who, tries to start Vectorworks with his serial number.<br/>

For example, imagine it was a long handle - you may to place it vertically on a cabinet door edge but it must be rotated to horizontal position for drawers.<br/>
Clearly, some symbols must be always rotated depending on insertion settings. Other have logical direction - and we cannot know if it is ok or not to rotate them.<br/>
 * Solution 1: Add mechanism in Vectorworks that would tell what kind of symbol is used and what direction it has.<br/>
 * Solution 2: Change the UI and add more settings, and let the user manually adjust for specific handles.

Currently, we can draw a circle that touches three straight lines with the &quot;Circle from Three Lines Mode&quot; of the &quot;Circle&quot; tool.<br/>
However, a circle that touches three circles or a circle that touches two circles and one straight line cannot be drawn without using constraints.<br/>
AutoCAD can easily draw with the &quot;circle&quot; command &quot;Tan, Tan, Tan&quot; mode.<br/>
It is a request to make it easier to draw in Vectorworks.<br/>

This command has the next issues:<br/>
 * Selecting the walls you want to frame is not intuitive. You almost need to know in advance which buttons you need to click before you can get the right dialog to select the necessary layers and classes. It would be more intuitive if the selection was just based on actual selection in the drawing<br/>
 * You can&#39;t choose the component you want to frame. It always takes the main component, but sometimes you want to frame a secondary component (for example for insulation against an existing brick structure)<br/>
 * The resulting objects are:<br/>
- Extrudes, which isn&#39;t fit for a quantity take off. Ideally the created objects would be framing members and/or structural members, so you can do a quantity take off<br/>
- Worksheets, which don&#39;t have a link to the actual objects<br/>
- 2D drawings, which don&#39;t have a link to the actual objects<br/>

The roof framer for comparison is a much more useful tool.

<br/>
A “Surface Array” is a combination of a<br/>
“Base Surface” + a “Array Item”<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I think, the “Array Items”<br/>
ALWAYS starts to array from a midpoint on<br/>
the “Base Surface” to the edges of the “Base Surface”.<br/>
<br/>
WISH:<br/>
In a lot of situations it is useful, if you have the ability<br/>
to manual set the start point of the “Array Items”,<br/>
to a user-defined start point.<br/>

When you want to start editing with other base information or different design goals, as for example ridge height or placement of ridges, it usually it usually involves a lot of trial and error to get to a certain result. <br/>
Therefore, it would be great to edit a roof by the ridge, so you can:<br/>
 * Set the height of the ridge. The roof edge would stay the same, the pitch of the adjacent roof faces would adapt automatically<br/>
 * Set The the position of the ridge in top/ plan. The roof&#39;s boundary would not change, the adjacent roof panes would adapt<br/>
 * Change the position of nodes between ridges. Again, the roof&#39;s boundary stays unchanged ad the adjacent roof faces adapt automatically to the changes.<br/>

See in the video underneath how it is possible in Archicad to edit roofs via the ridge.<br/>

These issues make it impossible for high-end BIM users to rely on auto binding. Because they can&#39;t rely on the auto binding, they have a lot more works to manage the wall- slab connections manually, which makes them look towards competitive software very easily.<br/>
<br/>
The way walls and slab link to each other should be improved, re- engineered or even redesigned, so users can actually use it and rely on it.

The attached PDF is showing a simple workflow to make this happen in Archicad with &quot;solid element operations&quot;. Most market leading BIM software solutions have tools like this built in.<br/>
Vectorworks needs (a) tool(s) like this, so the user has a much easier task to create a model without clashes and correct documentation drawings, which stay correct after slight edits. Now the user needs numerous workarounds to reach a result, which needs to be reworked extensively after edits.

When you create an elevation drawing with section viewport with a raster rendering (for example &quot;shaded&quot;), it is by default difficult to read the depth in the initial result. To avoid forcing users to draw a lot of semi transparent while polygons in the annotation, it would be nice if there was an automatic way to let the intensity of the raster image fade based on the depth of the objects behind the cut plane<br/>

In the advanced properties of the section viewport, there might be controls to regulate this. See how Revit manages this for their shaded elevation views: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxAW0qdv-TA].<br/>
the focus should be primarily on &quot;shaded&quot; renderings, but it might be nice if it works with Renderworks as well.<br/>
It can be implemented in a consistent way together with this feature request: [SECTION VIEWPORT: line thickness by depth|https://app.asana.com/0/1203207445474911/1203207445474911]

Roofs should be a tool, very similar to the Slab tool:<br/>
 * Just like the slab tool, the roof tools should offer different drawing methods (pick walls, by fill, polygon, rectangle,...<br/>
 * A rectangle mode (just like slabs should have a rectangle mode, see other wishes we submitted as design express already)<br/>
 * A roof face method (roof face as a method for the roof tool)<br/>
 * Just like slabs, there should be an option to create a roof and roof face based on a 2D shape with the &quot;create objects from shape&quot; command in the context menu. In this way, old workflows for roofs stay supported as well.

You find some wished improvements,<br/>
regarding how units should be interpreted for:<br/>
<br/>
Dimension, Dimension Area, Dimension Volume<br/>
<br/>
I think some settings must be a “Worksheet Definition”<br/>
and some settings can be cell-wise.<br/>
<br/>
I think the Data-Tag offers better and more flexible<br/>
settings for units.<br/>
<br/>
Worksheets Cell-Definitions should follow the Data-Tag!<br/>

But for walls above cut plane, everything will always look like you still cut through them.<br/>
<br/>
This limitation will lead users into using horizontal section viewports more easily, which is a box of Pandora you sometimes just don&#39;t want to open (because of limitations and different principals in graphical representation compared to top/plan view and complexity of visibility settings,... See our numerous VE&#39;s and VB&#39;s on horizontal section viewports)<br/>

Implementing this would allow users to represent walls correctly in top/plan, without getting lost in advanced presentation settings or 2D annotation hacks.

<br/>
1.<br/>
I think there is a BUG with “Offset” of the vertical<br/>
Structural Member (SM). Please see video.<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
As you can see in my attached video, there is a difference<br/>
when creating a horizontal and vertical SM in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
The horizontal SM can be drawn from start-to-end,<br/>
unfortunately, this is not possible with a vertical SM.<br/>
<br/>
For the vertical SM, a height must always be defined.<br/>
The bottom edge of the vertical SM is placed<br/>
according to the settings.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if we could make the vertical SM<br/>
also, with the start-to-end method.<br/>
<br/>
If you have placed a vertical SM, you can<br/>
edit the Member with the “blue handles” but you can&#39;t<br/>
create the vertical SM from start to end in 3D.<br/>

This is why users easily find their way to the command &quot;Window- Palettes- Save Palette positions&quot;, hoping that this might magically solve all their frustrations with just one click.

<br/>
Of course, they need to go to the Vectorworks Preferences to reset their palettes to their last saved state, but there are a few issues:<br/>
 * This functionality to reset the palettes is deeply hidden and located in a totally different location (Tools- Options- Vectorworks Preferences- Session- Reset Saved settings- top option) compared to the &quot;save palette positions&quot; command. Because of this, the average user will never find this functionality without tech support pointing it out.<br/>
 * The checkbox &quot;Tool modes, dialog positions, palette positions and dialog values&quot; doesn&#39;t only require to be read very carefully before a user noticed this functionality is included here, but also resets another set of user settings, which might be not desired by the user to be reset.<br/>
<br/>
This is why there should be a command &quot;reset palette positions&quot;, which does just that, located in &quot;Window- platettes&quot; just underneath &quot;Save palette positions&quot;. In this way, user will understand with a glace what it means to save palette positions, and how to get back to that saved state without resetting a bunch of other user settings at the same time.

                                            <td class="description">      The Push Pull Tool is usually able to retain an object&#39;s history by making the new shape a Solid Addition or Solid Subtraction. This is great since it&#39;s editable in the future. However, sometimes the tool can only create a Generic Solid due to the complexity of the object. This is fine, but I wish I would be made more aware of when this happens so that I could decide in that moment if I&#39;m okay with losing all object history.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: Provide users with a non-blocking warning message, such as the red text messages that appear in the lower right status bar. It could say &quot;Object has been converted to Generic Solid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That way I could choose to continue, or decide to Undo and save a backup copy of the old editable geometry before moving forward with the Push/Pull operation.<br/>

Also, in Vectorworks there is a high demand from customers to have possibilities to profile their walls, because 3D modeling is often impractical due to the lack of a possibility to f.e. insert windows.

Width and Height are inextricably linked with Shim Gaps. And a similar argument can be made for the *Gap Below Leaf* parameter, given that it can effect overall size.<br/>
<br/>
Matt rightly points out that there&#39;s currently no room in General for these parameters, so it would either need a redesign or we need some other way to more readily see the impact of editing one on the others.

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Attached you find a VW 2024 Beta file with some ideas for<br/>
an enhancement of the AutoHybrid object.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is, to enhance drawing with a mixture of 2D- and 3D-objects.<br/>
<br/>
If the Autohybrid could generate 2D-representations of all sides<br/>
of a 3D-object, this would be a very fast way to bring a 3D-object<br/>
into 2D-drawings.<br/>
<br/>
I think the wish could make sense.<br/>

We should be ale to draw Rounded Rectangles with the same modes as Rectangles, so please added Center-to-corner and Midpoint-to-corner.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, I didn&#39;t realize until typing this VE that the naming of the modes is inconsistent between the tools, so Diagonal mode and Rotated mode for Rounded Rectangle should be renamed to match those in the Rectangle Tool.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This might be another separate VE, but frankly I wish that Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles were combined into one object type, allowing users to simply add a radius to Rectangles when desired, instead of having to switch to a different tool. I quite frequently draw a bunch of Rectangles then realize I wanted them rounded, so have to redraw everything with the other tool. Instead, the Rectangle OIP &amp; mode bar should just have a field for corner radii (much like Photoshop and Illustrator). BTW I&#39;m avoiding using the fillet tool because I want the radii to remain parametric.

To archive this, the customer has to create a worksheet in order to be able to activate the windows in roof face, because in a roof face you have no direct access to the window.<br/>
Once activated you can set a unique name. But this name gos for all the windows. So the customer must create by duplicating as much windows styles as there are dormers or skylights.<br/>
This wish is, that you can insert windows in roof face by simply drag and drop. So you can insert the windows in your drawing, change the name and then grab them with the mouse and put them into the roof face.<br/>

When you double click on a texture in the resource manager while an object is selected on the other hand, you just want to apply this texture to the selected object. The texture tool shouldn&#39;t be activated, the current active tool should stay active in stead.<br/>
<br/>
We already got quite a few complaints from users about this behavior over the past 1,5 years.<br/>
<br/>
If you compare the behavior with other tool based resource types, you see that the behavior of textures is wrong. I take the wall styles as an example:<br/>
When you double click on a wall style in the resource manager whilo nothing is selected, the wall tool gets activated, so you can draw a wall with that specific style. When you double click on a wall style while a wall is selected on the drawing, that wall style will be applied to the selected wall. The wall tool will not be activated, the current active tool stays active.<br/>
<br/>
To summarize:<br/>
<br/>
When nothing is selected: A double click on a resource activated the necessary tool to use this resource. In case of a texture, the texture tool should be activated with settings to apply the chosen texture. This works as it should right now.<br/>
<br/>
When an object is selected: A double click on a resource should apply the resource on the selected object (in case of a supported object type). The current active tool should stay active and no tool preset settings should be changed. In case of a texture, the texture should be applied on the selected object. The texture tool should not be activated and its settings should not be influenced.<br/>
<br/>
In the TO about the texture tool (T02195), RM double click behavior is briefly mentioned:<br/>
&quot;With a supported object selected, users would be able to apply overall texture to the object by double clicking a texture from the Resource Manager. In this case, Texture tool will automatically become the active tool.&quot;<br/>
Literately taken, the tool does what the TO describes, but the TO is not mentioning anything about behavior whether an object is selected or not. So I think this is not taken into consideration with the design of this tool.

I suggest that switching modes in this case from Linear to Arc should behave more like changing vertex type with the Polyline Tool.  Don&#39;t dismiss all the vertices already clicked, just continue an Arc Wall from the last vertex.  <br/>
<br/>
That way if the user was intending to change Control Line Mode and muscle memory made them hit the &#39;U&#39; shortcut there is a way to recover all the previous work by invoking &#39;U&#39; again.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I would argue that the default behavior when switching from Linear to Arc or Arc to Linear should be to continue the Linear wall or Arc wall on a tangent from the last wall segment.

The basic insight that drives this is the fact that conduits and cable ducts don&#39;t cross the empty spaces of rooms - they follow walls, floors and ceilings and by convention they also run horizontally or vertically. _This is because tradesmen armed with drills don&#39;t expect diagonal cable runs!_ So with these constraints we have enough to figure out a reasonable route.<br/>
<br/>
But how do we get from room to room? We could have the Cable Path object just make a hole in wall, but in my experience it&#39;s more polite to ask before you drill a hole! In some cases holes need to be approved by the structural engineer. So they really need their own object through which our Cable Paths can pass.<br/>
<br/>
Wall Penetrations need to be either rectangular or circular that are automatically the thickness of the wall. Here are some pictures:<br/>

<br/>
When entering a value for an extrusion one can either enter a positive or negative value and the extrusion will be made above or below the working plane. Could we extrude an object in both directions at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
This would also address an inconsistency with the Extrusion value in the Object Information Palette which amends the Extrusion value by referencing the Centre of the Bounding Box.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in the Extrude dialog, there could either be a new field, a radio button, or even the ability to include a rather unmathematical +- before the extrusion amount.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to do this would make modeling simple center-originated geometry from 2D reference geometry so much quicker and would cut out an often repeated step: Align Middle/Align Centre.

<br/>
Roof faces should be displayed on a certain cut height. This height can either be controlled by the design layer&#39;s cut height (if used) or otherwise a parameter in the OIP (like for example with the Auto hybrid).<br/>
 * The cut plane should show the roof components<br/>
 * The part underneath the cut plane should show the 2D attributes assigned to the roof object<br/>
 * The part above the cut plane should be show in a dotted line and without fill by default. Options to change those attributes (Class based) should exist.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the option to create horizontal section viewports, but since the graphical qualities and the complexity of settings always disappoints users, this is not a feasible alternative (unless horizontal section viewports are going through some drastic changes soon. See my numerous bug- and enhancement reports about horizontal section viewports).<br/>
<br/>
Also, if this is implemented, it gives users a viewport which shows identically what they see in the design layer without any extra settings, which updates live. This would be a level of comfort that a horizontal section viewport currently can&#39;t offer (if ever).<br/>

In order to even create a site model, you need to have already a complete collection of data and you need to go through a series of dialogues before you even can get your first site model.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is the order of things. First you need to insert your data en turn this data into usable objects. From these objects you can create a site model. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this sequence when an advanced user exactly knows what he/she needs and how the tools work, but it sets the threshold for beginning users and users who just need a conceptual design unnecessary high.<br/>
<br/>
Parallel to the current workflow, I think there should be a more intuitive order of things to the current workflow.<br/>
<br/>
There should be a Site model tool, where you can just create a site model by drawing a simple boundary. The initial result will look like an extrude with a default height, or a height value entered by the user. Easy tools to manually manipulate the site model&#39;s surface will give the beginning user the confidence that he/she understand the tool, and can go deeper into the more advanced functionalities step by step. Some user will even not feel the need to go any deeper. Source data can be imported later on and be applied to the model.<br/>
<br/>
See the attached PDF, where the workflow for terrains in Archicad is explained. At first glance (I never used Archicad myself), the terrain functionalities in Archicad are more limited compared to Vectorworks, but that is not the focus. I think the workflow to set up a site model is easier to grasp for basic users and allows more experimental use, which is important to convince people to use a tool.

Currently I have 4 animations being processed by the VCS. When saved I gave each one a specific name as I had different settings etc.<br/>
<br/>
However when checking the desktop app there is no indication of which animation is making progress because only the file name is identified. So while I have been diligent naming the animations, I can not follow what is going on because as you can see in the screen shot each job has the same name because it comes from the same file.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that the job name is the one that the animation was saved as.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
there is a difference in the behavior of “Smart Edges” with the combination:<br/>
<br/>
Setting 1:<br/>
“Smart Edge” + 3D-Object + “Top/Plan” view OR &quot;Top&quot; view<br/>
Setting 2:<br/>
“Smart Edge” + 2D-Object + “Top/Plan” view OR &quot;Top&quot; view<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
With setting 1., the user CAN&#39;t create “Smart Edge” in Top/Plan view,<br/>
“Smart Edges” are only allowed in “Top” view for 3D-Objects.<br/>
<br/>
With setting: 2., the user CAN create “Smart Edges”: in Top/Plan view<br/>
AND in &quot;Top&quot; view.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The WISH:<br/>
please allow the creation of &quot;Smart Edges&quot; for 3D-Objects<br/>
also in &quot;Top/Plan&quot; view.<br/>
<br/>
In 3D planning, we need &quot;Smart Edges&quot; in all situations!<br/>

<br/>
It seems that the content of the Cabinets plug-in devided into three separate files up to Beta2 of Vectorworks 2024:<br/>
<br/>
- *WallCabinetDlg.vwstrings*<br/>
- *TallCabinetDlg.vwstrings*<br/>
- *BaseCabinetDlg.vwstrings*<br/>
<br/>
has been merged into one file: *Cabinets_Dialog.vwstrings* in Beta3 of Vectorworks 2024.<br/>
<br/>
This is just to let you know that such changes of the metadata attached to the strings have huge impact on the localization process.<br/>
<br/>
Each change in the metadata and/or the source text flags an affected string as New or Modified and requires manual work from translators. Even if only the metadata has changed.<br/>
<br/>
Similar changes resulted in more than 800 strings marked as Modified/Updatedin Beta3. Obviously, also some new strings might have been added, that&#39;s why the localization team has to verify each string one by one to avoid mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my request for the future, would it be possible to define the metadata (such as the plug-in and file name as well string identifiers) at the very beginning of the process to avoid such changes at a later stage? It would really allow us to focus on the substantial translator work, which will result in the better product quality.<br/>
<br/>
I would be really grateful for taking this into consideration in your process.

<br/>
This would export a CSV that would show all the connection for that device. The use case of this is to represent the connections as a table. I often patch devices like routers/matrices or network switches from a table.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, instead of exporting a CSV, it could create a VW worksheet I guess? That might be a more ConnectCAD way of working?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have attached a screenshot showing what I think the report would need to have as a CSV export. Let me know what you think!

<br/>
in the screenshot the line is on the position of the vertex of each of the circuits used for aligning them. As you can see it moves from the tip of the arrow to the center of the label. which works, but it looks rather strange, when layed out in a row and we would much prefer to align them by the arrow. <br/>
<br/>
Feature - So being able to position the vertex point (e.g. in the Circuit Graphics dialog) would be great.

-locate the hatch in the Resource Manager<br/>

This would allow for immediate access to vital hatch-editing functions, bypassing the extra step of right-clicking on the hatched object and choosing those options there, thus saving several clicks during a session.

Could be a new PIO, or maybe a generalization of the Section Line object to allow non-90º turns that would automatically know to generate a new viewport at the break.<br/>
<br/>
Resulting viewports could be automatically placed side-by-side (as an &quot;unrolling&quot; of the outside facades of the buildings) or not.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
@Josh Loy (We have discussed regarding a further development of Multi-View<br/>
already in contact with each other via Private Message in the Forum). <br/>
<br/>
Problem: Synchronization of the editing mode of groups with Multi-View. <br/>
If you use the option “Multiple Views” and switch to the edit mode of a group in one viewport, then switch to another viewport, then you have to activate the edit mode<br/>
of the same group there again, or in all remaining viewports.<br/>
<br/>
This is very cumbersome! <br/>
<br/>
It would be much better, if the status of the edit mode of groups<br/>
would be synchronized over all viewports.<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached video!<br/>

The &quot;Complex Line Type&quot; and the &quot;Tile&quot; are displayed in Vectorworks, but they are not maintained when the data is imported into another CAD, so compatibility with other CAD may be a problem.<br/>
We received an opinion that it would be very helpful if it could be created as objects like the &quot;Hatch&quot; menu.<br/>

Currently, neither of these is happening, which can be seen in the attached video and replicated using &#39;T02372 Renderworks Sectioning.vwx&#39;.<br/>

Another related improvement would be to handle each of the tabs in the Advanced Section Properties dialog separately since a user may only want to edit properties in one of the tabs for all selected Section Viewports without having the properties in the other tabs be changed for all selected Section Viewports.

With with some other tools, the double click is not supported. This is confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples:<br/>
<br/>
Supports double click:<br/>
 * Grid line<br/>
 * Data tag<br/>
 * Title block border<br/>
 * Elevation benchmark<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t support double click:<br/>
 * Drawing label<br/>
 * Reference marker<br/>
 * Section- Elevation line<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear to me why this behavior is different for these tools, so all object style based annotation tools should support editing by a double click.

One area that vieport style may be able to help with in the future is with annotations. <br/>
Currently the viewport style already enable users to add or change the viewport label which is in the annotations. <br/>
A really powerful enhancment to viewport styles would be to extend this to enable styles to insert Data tags, to tag eligible objects. <br/>
This would enable users to further automate their Documentation process. <br/>
<br/>
Each style would allow the user to set a single type of data tag that would be automatically applied to any eligible objects in the viewport annpotations layer, using the default offset defined in the data tags&#39; style.

For Vectorscript functions, the version when a specific function was added and/or deprecated is included in the Versions section of the Vectorscript Function Reference. Something similar is needed for worksheets.<br/>

                Braceworks enabled Structural Member object

</td>

The fundamental issues is that Structural members are not currently full Braceworks enabled objects. They can be used as an insertion point to support a hoist or bridle but do not react in any way to the forces that the connected hoists and brilde apply to them.<br/>
It is extremely common for riggers to need to know the amount of force acting on a beam across a fixed distance. This is not currently possible without a lot of workarounds<br/>
<br/>
Additionally they are not valid targets for the insert connection tool, it is really common for riggers to use spreader truss instead of Bridles to correctly position hoists and drops. Currently if the rigger draws the system as it would be configured in the real world they will not be able to calculate the system since it will register as unsupported to Braceworks.<br/>
<br/>
The solution to this issue is to have a Braceworks enabled structural member object that users can either add a load capacity per meter (as is commonly supplied by venues) or the ability to import a Structural engineering model of the beams (from SCIA?) that provides the needed data for Braceworks. <br/>
It would also need to be useable with the various modes insert connection tool<br/>
here are the most recent Braceworks forums threads on this<br/>

Undoubtedly this might already be on the radar but in the enclosed movie and file you can see that when using the Focus Lighting Devices command it is very difficult to judge where exactly the red indicators that move in real time are pointing to. <br/>
<br/>
The wish is that if any Lighting Devices are turned on that the actual light emitting from them would then replace the red indicators so users can see precisely what the beams are doing. If the Lighting Devices are turned off then the red indicators should come on.<br/>
<br/>
BTW in this build you might have to manually edit the workspace to add the command as I think it was missed if you are using the Design Suite one. <br/>
<br/>
VB-196962<br/>
New Design Suite workspace is missing &#39;Focus Lighting Devices&#39; command in Entertainment.<br/>

When running the Validate 3D Data command, if there are any overlapping 3D polygons you get the opportunity to create a group where loci will be placed at those points.<br/>
<br/>
With a busy plan full of contours these are hard to see. If the pen colour is changed to say red they are better seen but when when zooming in they get harder and harder to see.<br/>
Each time you edit, then delete the group and re-run the command hopefully there are fewer and fewer overlaps, but as there are fewer loci as well they are even harder to see.<br/>
In the enclosed Vectorworks file it took me an hour to clean it up and I must have made a dozen passes at tidying it up. A lot of the battle was finding the loci.<br/>
<br/>
The VE is to wish that something more visible could be produced, maybe something like a Stake object for example? I realise this is low priority but it certainly struck me as something that would be great to improve when working in real world conditions.<br/>
<br/>
I have included the Vectorworks file and a movie.<br/>

I&#39;m thinking in particular of viewports, where it&#39;s common to have a Shaded background render and a Hidden Line foreground render. In this scenario, the Clip Cube works properly for the background render, but the foreground render show all lines since it&#39;s not constrained to the Clip Cube. This can produce very strange looking results.<br/>

I realize it&#39;s a technological undertaking to solve, but it would be fantastic if all render modes worked with Clip Cube.

<br/>
The tool is limited by the fact that you can only manage one load at a time. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to manage multiple loads, you have to do it always in single steps. <br/>
<br/>
Better here is the possibility to manage multiple loads at the same time.<br/>

<br/>
At present the information must be researched and then obtained elsewhere, and then input in the Batt Insualtion Object Preferences dialog. The effort could be greatly reduced when using a tool that lets the user select the U-factor or R-value of the insulation, and have the tool create a batt insulation object with the corresponding thickness.

And this thread: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/63772-saved-views-import-and-export/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend my boss set up 20 Saved Views for a presentation this morning, in order to navigate to particular points of view within a 3D model we&#39;re developing. Turns out he had opened an old version of the file, instead of the current up-to-date working file. When we realized this 20 minutes before the meeting, he asked if I could just quickly import his Saved Views into the correct current file so we could see the current model with his points of view. Sadly this seems to be impossible, so I had to rush to manually recreate them all (I won&#39;t step through the process of how I did this accurately, but it indeed took the full 20 minutes and I was sweating!).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Saved Views are scripts. They live in the Resource Manager. Despite this, users cannot transfer them between files, which is just silly.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I realize that the Classes and Layers might differ between the source document and the destination document, but this is a solvable problem, as we&#39;re already able to copy and paste Viewports from one file to another for example.<br/>
<br/>
One solution might be that the imported Saved Views simply ignore any Classes/Layers that don&#39;t exist in the destination file. Another solution could be that these missing Class/Layer names are added to the destination file automatically (though they wouldn&#39;t contain any objects). There are other ways it could be addressed, but any possibility is better than no possibility.

Therefore, if it is a wall object, it will be easier to use if it is displayed as &quot;wall&quot;, so they would like you to implement the definition content additionally.<br/>

of DLVP AND NEW z-height relative to VW-origin.<br/>

2.<br/>
For some objects, the Data Bar could be reordered,<br/>
e.g. for Nurbs or 3D-Polygons it could be good to have &quot;lenght&quot; at 1st place<br/>

<br/>
We need a similar ability for 3D Viewports. For example, I often want doors _open_ in my 3D renderings, but they need to be _closed_ in my Elevations. This is currently quite cumbersome to accomplish, since I have to first render the 3D viewports with the doors open, then go to my model and manually shut the doors, then render my Elevations... and if anything in the design changes, I have to repeat this whole process each time. It&#39;s very slow and error prone, and also disallows me from using any sort of batch rendering or cloud rendering processes since I have to change object properties mid process.<br/>
<br/>
So 3D Viewports need a similar ability to what Graphic Legends can now do, forcing Doors &amp; Windows to show as Closed or Open. I imagine for Viewports it should actually be a dropdown called something like &quot;Door &amp; Window 3D Open State&quot; with the options:<br/>
<br/>
*• By Object* (matches current state as they exist in Design Layer)<br/>
<br/>
*• All Closed* (forces them closed and ignores Design Layer state)<br/>
<br/>
*• All Open* (forces them open and ignores Design Layer state)<br/>
<br/>

What needs looking at though is the workflow for adding items of equipment to an Inventory. Some companies I have worked for have many hundreds of Source 4 bodies in their inventories and being able to build an inventory without adding hundreds of specific items to a file is very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, if you click the &quot;Update Inventory File&quot; Button the selected inventory is overwritten by the Active File. This is a problem if you need to add or change an item in a saved inventory.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, we need the ability to select an item and then just that item and quantity will be added/updated to an existing named inventory. <br/>
<br/>
I can think of many inventories that could run into thousands of items and as things stand at the moment, when new equipment is added the whole inventory will need to be re-built. This will be unpopular.<br/>

<br/>
An image might even behave like a Styled object such that instances are seeded from a Style and controlled globally. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally we need a way to know and/or prescribe the actual real world size of an image or a feature in an image. (Perhaps similar to the way the RW Texture image scaler widget works.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when dragging an image from the RM, the user could be presented with the option to place the image as a bitmap (sized according to the &#39;style&#39; settings) or to place the image as an instance of the Style. <br/>
<br/>
Presently users are routinely using Adobe InDesign to compose moodboards. They are compelled to do this because whilst Vectorworks appears to handle images effectively, however in practise it is really too difficult and clumsy to achieve what is required effectively. <br/>
<br/>
Tantilisingly, with a little bit of improving, Vectorworks could be an excellent tool to share large collections of images via workgroup libraries.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks might even develop Image resources for distribution via the libraries. All manner of stock photos could be provided by manufacturers and suppliers etc. <br/>
<br/>
We may even benefit from a new Image Tool with it&#39;s own selector and preferences.<br/>
<br/>
With the growing Interior Design and Landscape Design markets, the wholesale review of the Image Resource is timely.

At this moment, it is not that easy to draw a gapped grid line. If you know in advance, you can use the polyline mode and hide sections afterwards, but when you want to change it afterwards with existing grid lines, it is a lot more cumbersome, as you can see in the attached video.<br/>
<br/>
In the video, you can see that the section line tool had a very simple functionality to draw a gapped line. I think we need to have this functionality for the grid line tool as well.<br/>
<br/>
The customer reporting this, told us Revit does have this functionality for grid lines.

<br/>
There are way too many &quot;Did You Know?&quot; pop-ups in Vectorworks. I see a ton of users who are scared to click &quot;Don&#39;t show this dialog box again&quot; because they feel that _eventually_ they&#39;ll actually take the time to read the message carefully, but _in the moment_ they just want it to go away, so they just click OK. However, users end up doing this habitually ad nauseam, meaning they constantly have pop-ups interrupting their workflow.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously some pop-ups are more important than others and should be kept. But there are a few that really shouldn&#39;t be blocking pop-ups in the first place. For example, this one which appears whenever you switch to wireframe view, suggesting the use of X-ray mode:<br/>
<br/>
!X-ray select.png|width=315,height=158!<br/>
<br/>
X-ray select mode is great, but do we really need a blocking pop-up every single to a user switches to Wireframe?<br/>
<br/>
Another example is the Navigation Palette telling you that can collapse all hierarchies every time you collapse one hierarchy:<br/>
<br/>
!Hierarchies.png|width=326,height=129!<br/>
<br/>
Both of these examples happen _every single time_ the user takes that action; they&#39;re not even once per session which would make more sense.<br/>
<br/>
Again, let&#39;s assume that folks aren&#39;t clicking &quot;Don&#39;t show this dialog box again&quot; because you&#39;d be surprised how many people just DON&#39;T click that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
+SUGGESTED SOLUTION+<br/>
<br/>
Find a way to make these helpful suggestions be non-model / non-blocking, so that a user can continue whatever they were doing without being _required_ to address the pop-up. *Pop-overs* are perfect for this sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
If these &quot;Did You Know&quot; messages were pop-overs, a user could read the message if they want, OR they could just proceed with whatever they were doing since they can still click anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of ways these &quot;Did You Know&quot; messages could be tied into the existing status bar along the bottom of the screen while expanding the functionality as well:<br/>
<br/>
For example, perhaps they could be tied into to the mode help text that&#39;s displayed in the lower left of the screen in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps these messages could be tied into the green status messages that sometimes appear in the lower right part of the screen:<br/>
<br/>
!InfoMessages.jpg|width=502,height=316!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there could even be a way for a user to return to these messages later. For example, these green status messages could collapse to an &quot;i&quot; info icon which a user could click to review previous status messages and &quot;Did You Know&quot; messages. This would be great because sometimes I want to go back and see how long previous Viewport renders took, so this would be available to me by clicking the &quot;i&quot; info icon to see past status messages.<br/>
<br/>
!InfoIcon.jpg|width=472,height=210!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Removing these blocking &quot;Did You Know&quot; messages would make Vectorworks feel much more fluid and intuitive, instead of choppy and annoying.

                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
Vectorworks lets you export georeferences images (geotiff) like tfw-file.<br/>
These files do use a comma as separator with numbers, like 10,5.<br/>
As you know in Germany we do use different separators for numbers, like 3.100,5.<br/>
You see the thousand separator and the decimal separator is different.<br/>
This could lead to problems with other softwares like Geomedia which cannot import the exported file because Vectorworks used the comma separator as decimal separator.<br/>
The wish is that you can select the separator on export in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
See:<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file<br/>
<br/>
Localization<br/>
When writing world files it is advisable to ignore localization settings and always use &quot;.&quot; as the decimal separator. Also, negative numbers should be specified with the &quot;-&quot; character exclusively. This ensures maximum portability of the images.<br/>

grid lines do adjust themselves in a cropped viewport in case they exceed the crop. The grid lines are automatically adjusted to the crop in annotation area.<br/>
Section lines are also in annotation area but they do not get resized in case they exceed the crop. Customer has to resize them by hand.<br/>
When you resize the section line in annotation area this has no effect to the original section line on design layer.<br/>
So there is no danger when they would get resized automatically like grind lines.<br/>
Wish that the section lines do have the same behavior like grid lines in a cropped viewport.<br/>

My use for this would be equipment lists for complex factory build plumbing systems. Just like lighting uses instruments and accessories, plumbing has valves, fittings, pipe and often adapters to change the size prior to the next piece of pipe or other connections.<br/>
<br/>
Similar would be landscape irrigation where a &quot;complete&quot; list of different sizes and types of fittings and valves would be useful to be able to prepare equipment lists easily.<br/>

If you want to make a new one, you must back out of the Resource Selector, go to the Resource Manager proper, make a new gradient, then return to the Attributes Palette Resource Selector to choose that Gradient. Very cumbersome and unintuitive.<br/>
<br/>
I teach Vectorworks to a lot of new users, and I can say that 99% of users _expect_ to be able to create new resources in the relevant Resource Selectors, but confusingly this is not possible. A button should be added to create the relevant resource type:<br/>
<br/>
!NewGradient.png|width=472,height=282!<br/>
<br/>
Another great example is Textures. I recently gave a lesson to someone who&#39;d been using Vectorworks for almost 2 years, and they had no idea that you even _could_ make new Textures from scratch, since they only ever interacted with the Render Tab to apply textures and there&#39;s no way to create one from there. Adding a button to create a new Texture (which would also automatically apply it) would make the process much more intuitive and discoverable.<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s say we have worksheet-01 and worksheet-02.<br/>
<br/>
In worksheet-02 in the cell B1 we write<br/>
=&#39;some string&#39;<br/>
<br/>
In worksheet-01 in the cell A1 we write<br/>
=&#39;worksheet-02&#39;:B1<br/>
<br/>
That will show in A1 of worksheet-01 the value of the cell B1 of worksheet-02.<br/>
<br/>
Now we add a row above B in worksheet-02. This causes &#39;some string&#39; to be moved one row downwards in worksheet-02. But this also causes the string to disappear from worksheet-01 A1.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because in Vectorworks cell-referencing only tracks positional cell changes, when it&#39;s a cell in the same worksheet, not outside of it.<br/>
<br/>
Excel can track changes in both cases. This is how it should work in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Please consider, that this must be thought out for Data Manager as well as the Data Tag, where such references can be used. Any upcoming excel-live connection should support this, too.

the situation here is two source files referenced to a master file.<br/>
Using data visualization runs into the problem, that classes with identical names in all three files are listed separately in data visualization.<br/>
See screenshot. For example you find here Klasse 1, Klasse 1 (referenced from file1) and Klasse 1 (referenced from file2).<br/>
Customer has to set data visualization settings for alle three classes separately, which is somehow cumbersome when you have many classes.<br/>
This wish here would be, that you can select a couple a classes and then make your settings for all these selected classes at once.<br/>
Or maybe an option to transfer the settings of one class to others.<br/>

I would consider this to be an important update and it would be really helpful if it could be introduced as part of the training package that is created for the new Inventory Command and Schedule Tools when 2024 is released later in the year.

especially the black color causes problems when a document gets purged.<br/>
You have three or four times the very same black color with RGB=0,0,0 but with different color name. So this black gets listed a separate color.<br/>
The wish would be, that you can purge those colors with the identical RGB value but different color name. Maybe a dialog opens to ask you which color name to use.<br/>

VE-100879<br/>
<br/>
I would like to propose a lighting device offset function that offsets the lighting device by a pre-defined Z height.<br/>
<br/>
Lighting Devices with clamp fixings never properly insert on truss objects and the clamp is never aligned with the chord geometry.<br/>
<br/>
This could be part of Spotlight preferences or as part of the Lighting Device Mode Bar<br/>
<br/>
This function only needs to work with Truss objects. All other rigging objects don&#39;t require this as the centre of the chord is aligned to the insertion point of the Rigging Object.<br/>

It would be visually more evident, if those tools/command will be shown, but greyed out. It will prevent users from clicking them.

Since there is a change in this settings window the text is more important than the preview window, and if we increase the settings menu only the preview window increases i think we should be able to resize this to our content as i believe i&#39;m not alone that the options marked as 2 is more important and we want to see everything instead of scrolling backs and forwards to see which class belongs to each item... i have created a style and from there i can identify what my needs are, but this is lazy updating of the settings window menu...

<br/>
We kindly request that the Vectorworks tech team add a new function to the Stake Tool that allows Chinese designers to show coordinates with switched X and Y values in a &quot;X=&quot; and &quot;Y=“ expression as shown in the attached screenshots and dwg file. This will greatly improve the efficiency of our Chinese users&#39; work.<br/>

[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/108234-c4d-light-export-request/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been using C4D and Vectorworks for quite a while now. I have a suggestion that would save me a ton of time....<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If the Lights that are exported to C4D could instead of all being named &quot;Spot Light&quot; they could instead assume the Fixture Type name + the Class they are in, it would make things a lot easier to organize.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As of right now the only thing distinguishing the Spot Lights from eachother are the &quot;Inner and Outer Angle&quot; values.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If there is someone out there who could write me a Script that would do the same thing as &quot;Export to C4D, &gt; Lights&quot; but with the addedcharacteristics that I mentioned above, that would help me out immensely...

<br/>
If Vectorworks moved towards this model, where crashes and feature failures that are straight-forwards to fix and test get released on a frequent basis, it would be a huge win for both customer experience and Vectorworks&#39; reputation. In addition to crashes, Vectorworks should include fixes for fundamental features. For example, a rendering bug that affected a large portion of my users was fixed a couple days after the release of SP4. While I had access to a fix right away, I had to tell my users they needed to wait patiently for SP5.

<br/>
It would be nice to be able to hold down a modifier key when hitting return and have the command use the opposite sign.  So if the field in the Move dialog box showed 3 mm if I hold down the shift key when I hit return the object would actually move 3 mm to the left instead of to the right.  Similarly with the Y field.<br/>
<br/>
Other possible enhancements:  Different modifiers for X and Y.  So if Shift is for X and Ctrl is for Y then holding down both Shift and Ctrl would move reverse in both directions.<br/>
<br/>
And if the Alt/Option key is help down, then the movement in the other axis is zero.  So Shift and Alt would move only in the X direction. Ctrl and Alt would move only in the Y direction.

<br/>
Use case: When setting out the storeys on a project, description and notes can be added to indicate information that should remain with a storey as the project develops. Not only would this information be helpful as other team members become involved in a project but it would help when projects go dormant and then re-awaken. For example, I am currently reviving a file that I began four years ago and storeys have been set to very particular heights and it took me a while to determine why I had used those exact heights. In another case, when working on larger projects, floor-to-floor design heights may be set different than local zoning allows, and having notes included with a storey as to why this was done would be helpful. There are a multitude of instances where it would be great to have a description included with each storey.<br/>

Thank you for considering this.

At present, you cannot place symbols inside a Tile. It does not support 3D objects or symbols. This means you cannot report quantities of repeating objects.

How to Reproduce:<br/>
1) Open the sample file.<br/>
　50000 Rectangles are arranged in a spiral, and only the frontmost rectangle has its solid attribute set to &quot;tile&quot;,<br/>
The attributes of the other rectangles are set to &quot;color&quot;.<br/>
2) When zooming in/out, it takes a few seconds to complete the drawing sheet update, which is obviously slow.<br/>
(It&#39;s easy to understand because the tile lines become thicker and blurry until the drawing update is completed.)<br/>
3) Even if selecting a placed rectangle until the drawing sheet update is completed, the information is not immediately displayed in the object information palette, and it is obviously slow.<br/>
4) After drawing sheet update is completed, zoom in/out again.<br/>
5) Until the drawing sheet update is completed, even if drawing with the rectangle tool, the rectangle will not be displayed immediately, and it is obviously slow.<br/>

Mac specs at the time of video creation are as follows.<br/>
Model : MacBookPro16,2<br/>
Processor: 2 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5<br/>
Memory: 16 GB<br/>
Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 1536MB<br/>
Mac OS Ventura 13.2.1<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the PC specifications when reproducible on Windows are as follows.<br/>
Model : dynabook S73/DP<br/>
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz (8 CPUs), ~2.1GHz<br/>

Graphics: Intel (R) UHD Graphics 620 8275 MB<br/>
OS: Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit<br/>
<br/>
Also, just in case, as a result of investigating on a relatively high-spec Mac machine (M2 MacBook Pro) in the department,<br/>
The impression was that the performance was slightly improved, but the operation was still slow.<br/>
Here are the machines I checked:<br/>

It would be great if there was an option to purge double symbols in your file within the same design layer. I could only find an components option within a symbol at the moment.<br/>

Many people new to Vectorworks call in confused as to what their activation key is when they should not even be touching that software.  They then complain that there is no clear instruction as to what that is for.

<br/>
In the roof component settings, in the *Edge condition &gt; Wall Associated &gt; Modification*, there are three drop-down options available:<br/>
- None<br/>
- Clipped by Walls<br/>
- Clip Walls<br/>
<br/>
Problem: &quot;Clipped by Walls&quot; option name for editing roof components is confusing. Users often choose the wrong option because of this.<br/>
<br/>
Possible solution: &quot;Clip roof&quot; would be more straightforward when seen next to the other options in the drop-down: &quot;Clip Walls&quot; and &quot;None&quot;. This option will modify the roof instead of walls, so it will be more self-explanatory.<br/>
<br/>
See: https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Roofs/Creating%20roof_components.htm?rhsearch=roof%20components&amp;rhhlterm=roof%20roofs%20components%20component<br/>
<br/>
The help text in the manual would perfectly correspond with the suggested solution:<br/>
- Clip Walls<br/>
- Clip Roof<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-05-16-12-01-59-998.png|thumbnail! Modification: Determines whether the roof component clips the wall, or if the wall clips the roof component<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1. Create a roof<br/>
2. Select the roof and click the Component buttons in the OIP.<br/>
3. Click the New button to define settings of a new roof component.<br/>

Such an image is readily imported into Vectorworks, however it is very difficult to drape/map/texture this image to surface of a Site Model. [It is possible to create a RW Texture and then size and locate it (to match the imported geo image) using the Attributes Mapping tool. This workflow is quite convoluted, requires a higher understanding of how geo images are scaled and subject to the vagaries of locating using the Attributes Mapping tool. (refer attached Texture.png)]<br/>
It would be ideal if a user could import their geo image and then use the Send to Surface command to have it draped/mapped/textured over the terrain surface. (refer attached LIV.png)

                Unique help identifiers in the ArchitecturalObjects plug-in

<br/>
Would it be possible to use meaningful help identifiers in the following plug-in: ArchitecturalObjects?<br/>
<br/>
+For example in the following files:+<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14000 DoorSettingsDlg.vwstrings<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings<br/>
<br/>
If each string had its unique help identifier instead of a number, adding new parameters to this file wouldn&#39;t change the existing strings anymore.<br/>
 <br/>
We use a translation database for translation, where any strings, whose either help ID or source text has changed, are marked as New. In fact, it gives false new results, because very often those strings have been translated, but since they use numbers as help identifiers, their help ID has changed and they are treated as New.<br/>
<br/>
Assigning meaningful help identifiers would save distributors a lot of work, because we could focus only on real new parameters instead of filling out existing translations.<br/>
<br/>
As a good example, you can take a look at the helpIDs e.g. in the GridAxis.<br/>
I&#39;m also more than willing to share our own meta data guidelines for developers.<br/>
<br/>
+Example:+<br/>
It is:<br/>
ArchitecturalObjects &gt;14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; *28*&gt; Window Shape:<br/>
ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14551 Window_params.vwstrings &gt; *301* &gt; Window Shape	 	 	<br/>
ArchitecturalObjects &gt;14555 Window_OIPparams.vwstrings	&gt; *107* &gt; Window Shape<br/>
<br/>
It could be:<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt;14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; *Dialog_Settings_General_WindowShape* &gt; Window Shape:<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14551 Window_params.vwstrings &gt; *Parameters_WindowShape* &gt; Window Shape	 	 	<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt;14555 Window_OIPparams.vwstrings &gt; *Parameters_OIP_WindowShape* &gt; Window Shape<br/>
<br/>
Meaningful help identifiers would also help us to locate any corresponding help texts to a given parameter.<br/>
<br/>
+Example:+<br/>
<br/>
It is:<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; * 943* &gt; Choose a shape for the window.<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; *944* &gt; Choose a shape for the window.<br/>
<br/>
It could be:<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; *Dialog_Settings_General_WindowShape_help* &gt; Choose a shape for the window.<br/>
- ArchitecturalObjects &gt; 14500 WindowSettingsDlg.vwstrings &gt; *Dialog_Settings_General_WindowShape_help* ??? &gt; Choose a shape for the window.<br/>
<br/>
The last example shows very well, that without such a meaningful help ID, we can&#39;t really know for sure which string it belongs to.<br/>
<br/>
By adding the param location: Dialog name + Pane/Tab name (*Dialog_Settings_General*), it helps us to identify records correctly.<br/>
<br/>
 !image-2023-05-16-12-40-05-871.png|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d consider improving this in Vectorworks 2024 SP4 or Vectorworks 2025.

We need to be able to enter a revision code like this AND utilise automatic revisioning via the Title Block Manager.<br/>

Current behaviour means we have to use either &#39;letters&#39; or &#39;numbers&#39; in the revision numbering options to ensure that when we add a revision to multiple sheets VW adds the next revision to all sheets as opposed to the same revision if we set the revision numbering options to manual.<br/>
<br/>
We need three fields in the revision data tab:<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary or Contractual = P or C<br/>
<br/>
Revision Number<br/>
<br/>
Sub-Revision Number (with option to ignore this and when ignored incrementally increase the Revision Number only).<br/>

Regularly we are made aware by customers that the higlighting deviates quite strongly from the real object and this confuses / unsettles. A good example for this behaviour is a circle.<br/>

<br/>
Nevertheless, it would be great if the look and the feeling of existing auto-hide UI-elements (e.g. docked and floating palettes) would be the same like the View Bar. Currently, the palettes have that black contour line while the View Bar has shadows, which gives a nice 3D look. Also, I think the movements when appearing/hiding are a little bit different.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the &#39;Palette Options&#39; could be placed together with the View Bar Options, because they fit really well together! If all auto-hide options are enabled, the new Vectorworks comes with a full focus on the drawing surface :)

currently data tag can be aligned to walls or parametric objects only.<br/>
Wish that data tag can be aligned to edges of other objects, e.g. polyline.<br/>
<br/>
This wish comes from a customer of us who does shape imports. The imported objects are contour lines. The height of those line are displayed bay data tag. The text is always horizontal and it would be fine when the text gets aligned.<br/>

The user should be able to make a choice which image props he can use in the drawing. A lowres or highres image. I understand that for performance reasons the lowres image is used, but if the user wants a fully detailed image, he should be able to download the highres.<br/>
We have a customer that complains about it: [https://forum.designexpress.eu/topic/1045-les-plantes-en-3d/]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This can solved on 2 ways:<br/>
 * option: use lowres or highres image<br/>
 * give somewhere a notification where he can download or buy the highres image. In the tags, or ....

<br/>
We need the ability to display background 2D fills for flattened DLVPs. <br/>
<br/>
In SLVPs it is possible to embellish a HLR in the annotations environment. eg; a tile (hatch) poly may be placed behind the HLR geometry and the 2D components of Symbols will mask the hatch. This is a very effective workflow. <br/>
<br/>
However, it is not possible to do the same in a flattened DLVP.<br/>
<br/>
It is quite common and often desirable to compose elevations partially from geometry harvested from a model and partially from 2D linework, directly on a Design Layer. [The &#39;hybrid&#39; drawing is then passed to a SLVP.] Not being able to have 2D fills mask other linework hampers this workflow.

<br/>
If you are importing the symbols you have options to Import or to Activate the symbol which makes it the selected symbol in the Symbol Insertion tool and makes the tool active. This makes for a one step process to select and be ready to import the symbol.<br/>
<br/>
But if you Reference the symbol, it does not make it the selected symbol in the Symbol Insertion tool nor does the tool become active. So you have to Reference the symbol and then switch to the current file, location and select the symbol and either Make Active or double click to make it selected in the Symbol Insertion tool. Many more clicks than the Import option.<br/>
<br/>
I would like an additional option to Reference and Make Active. It would Reference the symbol and then make the referenced symbol selected for the Symbol Insertion tool and activate the tool.

Currently I have to look in the view bar for project file refresh, then in the resource browser, tab 6 (which may not be active) to see if references are out of date.<br/>

For extra credit, add a third indicator showing there is stuff in the current working file that has not been committed to the project file.<br/>

<br/>

Yellow/Green for project files has a new update<br/>

Red/Green for a out of date file reference.<br/>

This is a nice feature and avoid a lot of mouse navigation and „guides&quot; the user. Currently a dynamic text and normal text inside the data tag layout look the same. The only thing we would like to comment is that maybe the dynamic text could indicate if it is dynamic or not by adding a chain icon?  In that way it makes clear that it is a dynamic text already and the dialog will be open by double clicking on it.<br/>

In the real world a 2-leg bridle will only ever have a chain on one of the legs, and a 3-leg bridle typically only one or 2 of the upper legs. One of te main reasons for this is the chains are very heavy compared to regular steels and onsite riggers do not want to have to haul the extra weight into the roof.<br/>
Currently anyone using our bridle tool has to manually edit every single bridle drawn to remove the extra chains, which defeats the purpose of using the tool as it is very time consuming and difficult to do successfully

When filtering a graphic legend by viewport, it would nice to be able to just select the viewport rather than scroll through the dialogue box.<br/>
<br/>
Since Graphic Legends can only be placed on sheet layers, I think it&#39;s a fair assumption that when one is filtering by viewport, the majority of the time the Graphic Legend will be placed on the sheet where the viewport is.<br/>
<br/>
For example when doing electrical layouts, the Graphic Legend is a great tool to show the key with additional data pulled from symbols.<br/>
<br/>
layouts.png <br/>
<br/>
When you click the Graphic Legend &quot;Filter by Viewport&quot; option you get this dialogue box:<br/>
<br/>
FilterDlg.png<br/>
<br/>
 This is of course useful, but it would also be nice to just click the viewport, in the same way as one would select walls to associate a slab or roof to etc. Often the viewports (in our office at least) are not named very well and it is a bit of a pain to scroll through them all to find the one you need when it&#39;s sitting right there on the page and could easily just be selected!<br/>

                Site Model Phasing
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Previous week, during our talks with [~kollikainen], an idea for Site Model Phasing/Staging enhancement arose. <br/>
<br/>
The goal is to be able to *preserve the current state of a portion of the proposed surface* utilizing the Grade Limit&#39;s capabilities rather than by extending the Site Model itself to keep additional states beyond &quot;existing&quot; and &quot;proposed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The boundary of the Grade Limits always fits to the current surface and so defines (encloses) a portion of it. When the Grade Limit has internal modifiers, they are applied to the limited surface area and, depending on their settings, either smooth slopes or vertical transitions are created between their edges and the region&#39;s boundary.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to add a new button (or perhaps an option?) to the Grade Limits object.<br/>
This button will be used *to &quot;fixate&quot; the modification within the Grade Limits* (means the overall modification inside the Grade Limits).<br/>
<br/>
As I see it behaving, it will &quot;convert&quot; the Grade Limits modifier, along with all the modifiers inside it, into an object specifying the state of the modified surface (i.e. one that completely defines its surface).<br/>
<br/>
As I see it behaving, it will &quot;convert&quot; (or use) the Grade Limits modifier, as well as all the modifiers contained within it, into an object that fully specifies the state of the modified surface within the former Grade Limits (i.e. into a new fully defined surface object).<br/>
<br/>
For the way the new object will define its surface, I can think of two options:<br/>
<br/>
Option I. The new surface-state object will be defined by:<br/>
* Base surface - a copy of the part of the current surface that was bounded by the Grade Limits.<br/>
* The set of all modifiers that were internal and applicable in the Grade Limits.<br/>
That is, *it will be defined in the same/similar way that the proposed Site Model surface has been defined so far* (as a Surface Collection, i.e. hierarchical multi-surface TIN model), and *will include internal modifiers to define it hierarchically*. <br/>
This seems to imply that its internal modifiers must be stored and accessed in a special edit group. <br/>
These modifiers should be integrated into the new surface-state modifier object. <br/>
However, *there will be a problem with this approach because in addition to the Site Modifiers, other objects provide modifier components* for the Site Model as well (such as the Hardscape (which embeds the Site Modifier), Roadway, Massing Model, etc.).<br/>
We don&#39;t want to lose such objects, so we can only use their modifier components to define the new surface-state modifier object (note that this is not the case with the Site Modifier which is only used to modify the site model and has no other functions). The modifier components of such objects could be copied into the newly created surface-state object. <br/>
<br/>
Option II. <br/>
* The new surface-state object will be completely defined by a single finished surface, which will be the same as the result of applying the Grade Limits modifiers to the surface it bounds.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, the *question is what to do with the modifiers and objects that provide modifier components, now that they are included in the new generalized surface-state modifier: disable them as modifiers and lock them, or do something else?* This is a flaw in the concept.

Each part has a callout and it keyed to the dimensions below the graphic.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, the door&#39;s (2D) threshold graphics, highlighted in red, are overly simplistic and therefore make it more difficult to set and visualize the dims of the threshold&#39;s parts. In addition to this, some parts/options, highlighted in yellow, are not even shown in the 2D graphic because it is a side view of the threshold – a 3D view similar to the window sill&#39;s graphics would be needed to portray these parts.<br/>
<br/>
It would be *great* if the door threshold&#39;s graphics could be updated to be a 3D representation of this door element and the missing parts/dims added to the new 3D threshold graphic.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.<br/>

In the past, you could double-click on the north arrow in the Classic plan header, and then you could set the degrees and the scaling directly in a small window. Unfortunately, this no longer works. It would be great if you could do this again.<br/>

You only can set a specific value to all objects.<br/>
The wish is, that you can add a value, so that every single value of this group gets this value added to its present value.<br/>
Maybe using a joker like * + 10&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
The first option force deletes the definition and any instances.<br/>
<br/>
The second option deletes the definition and replaces instances with loci.<br/>
<br/>
The third option deletes the definition and replaces instances with a different symbol definition.<br/>
<br/>
What we need is a new fourth option: to delete the symbol definition *and convert any instances in the drawing to groups.*<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For example, this is frequently desired after importing a file (such as DWG or SKP) which might contains dozens of unnecessary symbol definitions which need to be cleaned up &amp; de-symbolized, meaning you want to keep the geometry in the drawing, but don&#39;t need certain things to actually be symbols.<br/>
<br/>
While there are ways to accomplish this directly in the drawing by navigating to symbol instances and then using the Convert to Group command, this can be quite laborious to manually sift through an entire file and find the instances that you want to convert, particularly when there are numerous nested levels and sub-parts.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, it would be incredibly convenient to simply go to the RM, right-click the definitions that you don&#39;t need to be symbols, choose Delete, then choose the new &quot;Convert Instances to Group&quot; option in order to retain the raw geometry within the drawing.

<br/>
Much of what he&#39;s asking for is probably too much detail for the door PIO and would be best handled in detail drawings.  However, a jamb stop is often requested by users.  He sent me these examples from acoustical doors which show various stops that are more than a simple rectangular shape.  He&#39;d like to be able to show their general shapes (as shown in red) in the attached file).  While this may also be a bit too much detail for the PIO, I think we should at least add a door stop with a rectangular profile.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s his list of requests as described in the attached file:<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      When creating a BIM that will have its energy use assessed with Energos, having complete thermal coefficient data (R or U value, among other criteria) is {*}crucial{*}. Without this data embedded into objects, projects can fail Energos checks and leave users confused as to why the failure occurred. And given the potentially vast number of building envelope objects (walls, windows, doors, slabs, roofs) that must have energy-use data included, there is a high potential for any object to accidentally omit the data. This data can currently only be seen in the OIP/style dialog/settings dialog for any given object, or perhaps by reporting to worksheet - In any case, the data cannot be seen &quot;on&quot; the object. Therefore, being able to see which objects do or don&#39;t have thermal coefficient data (and other criteria) embedded would help increase accuracy, design workflow speed, and support our story of Vectorworks as an energy analysis tools for designers.<br/>
<br/>
This is where data visualization could be used to aid in the process of double-checking or &quot;auditing&quot; a BIM...<br/>
<br/>
With data visualization, users could see if any given object in a BIM:<br/>
 * Had R or U value assigned or not<br/>
 * Had R or U value calculated or assigned manually via the object&#39;s &quot;override&quot; option<br/>
 * Had the &quot;Energos &gt; Include in calculations&quot; option checked on or not<br/>
 * Was within a series of user-set R or U value ranges<br/>
 * Was set to a specific frame and/or glazing status, in the case of windows and doors.<br/>
 * Was set to a specific shading status, in the case of windows and doors <br/>
<br/>
By showing any of the above using data visualization, users would be able to quickly see if/how a BIM was complying with parameters needed for energy analysis.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is... {*}The object parameters for the above-listed data are not available &quot;natively&quot; to the data visualization mechanism{*}. (There is a rather involved workaround to use the data manager and record formats to accomplish what is needed, but that process is too demanding to propose it as viable solution to designers. R/U value is a basic object property in real construction scenarios so that data should be readily available in data visualization without workarounds.)<br/>
<br/>
The solution would be to {*}make the R and U values (and other Energos-related criteria) for walls (regular and curtain), doors, windows, slabs, and roofs (both individual objects and object styles) accessible with data visualization{*}.<br/>
<br/>

This would enhance and improve the ability to to filter by tag, for example, and provide a direct visual approach to layers or classes upon the user&#39;s discretion.

The DMX Patch command has so much potential when dealing with a large number of lighting devices and the mapping functions of each universe are really helpful. However, the command falls short with regard to understanding the geographic location of an object on a position which makes it really quite hard to use.<br/>

Was reminded of this need after batch converting a load of projects on One Drive where, like Dropbox, etc, you can de-select folders to sync and therefore remove from the batch conversion process, like &#39;SS&#39; or Superseded folders and existing Archives.<br/>

<br/>
The &quot;Border&quot; style is an object where the upper hanging position is constructed with a centerline and the lower hem pleats are slanted back and forth.<br/>
They can change the position back and forth with &quot;Reverse side&quot; ON or OFF in the Object Info palette.<br/>
For that reason, if setting it to 2D/Top, only the pleats of the hem will be displayed, and the display will be shifted forward and backward from the displayed centerline.<br/>
<br/>
The curtain type also has the display of the pleats of the hem, but it is drawn at the core(centerline) when it is made into a 2D/Top.<br/>
<br/>
When displayed the &quot;Border&quot; style in 2D/Top, it will be drawn with the same core(centerline) as the curtain style, so it would like you to change the display of Vectorworks as well.<br/>
And they would like you to be able to set &quot;front / center (core) / back&quot; as &quot;Pleat position&quot; instead of &quot;Reverse side&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
When revision clouds are placed in a drawing, a revision marker is often located immediately adjacent to the revision cloud to identify the revision number or instance. In architectural documents, the revision marker is often a triangle with a number or letter within it.<br/>
<br/>
A document may contain multiple revisions–and multiple revision clouds–simultaneously. Revision markers help identify the most recent revisions, among other things. Large documents with multiple revisions can require an extensive and time-consuming effort to go through all the sheets and apply the correct revision markers in the proper locations.<br/>
<br/>
The enhancement request: automatically add a revision marker to each revision cloud instance, using predetermined parameters (number or letter, for example). Clicking on the revision cloud tool, and then drawing a revision cloud in the plans, would automatically place a correctly-numbered revision marker immediately adjacent to the drawn cloud each time the tool is used.

                                            <td class="description">      In my area, every project requires a drainage plan showing how water is collected from the site and the building roof, and then conveyed to the street (or to an in-site collection spot).<br/>
<br/>
This means that drainage lines must often extend lengthy distances, and the total drop becomes a significant challenge to resolve, since the water must emerge through the curb at the street’s elevation, and the line’s slope must conform with code requirements. This often results in much trial-and-error drawing and redrawing of drainage points and lines, to ensure that the slope is adequate and that the line emerges at the correct elevation. <br/>
<br/>
Operationally, the user of a site drainage tool would do the following:<br/>
-click on the tool<br/>
-set up (perhaps in the tool’s preference dialog) a starting invert elevation and minimum slope<br/>
-then draw a line all the way to the street. <br/>
<br/>
Upon completion of the action, the tool would place a label near the end of the drawn line, showing an invert elevation, and another label _along_ the line, showing a direction arrow and average line slope.

For many residential projects, laying out stairs is one of the first planning/design tasks as the resulting info helps determine floor-to-floor dimensions, available clear head height, and floorspace occupied by the stair. All of these are more complicated to calculate using the standard stair tool because of the complex interaction of its many options.<br/>
<br/>
The bare-bones nature of the Simple Stair tool makes for an easy-to-use and extremely efficient planning tool. Enhancement with a couple of features would make it even more useful: control of the stair object&#39;s thickness (helps provide info for available headroom beneath) and fix the Show Top Tread feature, which is currently broken.

_I just used Vectorworks Cloud for the first time to pull together a quick walkthrough of this project with the client. It was easy to create and flowed nicely by pinning imagery to a site plan. I love that we have flexibility with slide layouts now. It’s a great way to pull together a quick, polished design update without building out a full slide deck. I can see this as a great asset for project interviews and walking a client through site analysis as well. Some feedback:_<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * _We need to be able to add our own font for use in Text Boxes or custom Pin Text within a presentation. Use of Cloud Presentations will be somewhat limited until this is possible._<br/>
<br/>
 * _It would be nice if branding could be applied to the landing page for a shared Presentation link – at least showing our logo._<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * _The previous version of Cloud Services had presentation templates. The new version seems to have lost these – it would be nice to be able to have those templates back as starting points or be able to create our own. The duplicate feature essentially does this but it having that consistency across projects and being able to pull in slide formats at any time is super helpful. I suppose we could create sample presentations that serve as templates, but then we’d have to figure out how to distribute them across the team. Not sure how to create team resources within Cloud Services currently. Creating team resources like saving shared colors, fonts, etc. is also a big goal._<br/>
 * _For longer presentations, sharing presentations for editing between team members in our Organization would be essential – sharing could address the template issue above as a workaround but the main use case is that I often find it’s both our PMs and project designers working on content and layout updates. Is there currently a way to do this?_<br/>
 * _Could there be a streamlined way for external collaborators to add presentation resources? (so now we’re talking about view/add/edit permissions for sharing)_<br/>
 * _Is there a way we could pin existing site panoramas to a presentation? Kind of like the way model panoramas can be pinned? This would add such a cool dimension to site analysis presentations when walking a client through observations—both during an interview or during initial meetings._<br/>
 * _I can’t seem to select and edit two or more objects at once. My goal is to maintain relationships between two objects while I shift them around, i.e. a pin and an image. It would be great if some kind of association could be made between the two objects, whether that’s being able to create groups, select multiple objects at once, or have them anchored to each other._<br/>
 * _The custom text on a pin has some awesome applications and I love the flexible formatting, but currently if I go past a certain length or use large text I can’t scroll through the pin because it disappears if I hover off it. Not trying to add novels to pins but more dynamic formatting for text pins would alleviate this issue._<br/>
 * _More shapes for pins – square, rectangle, etc.. Can currently only do circle._<br/>
 * _A simple geometry tool would be nice to add from a formatting standpoint, i.e. to utilize as backgrounds for text floating on top of an image. Even if it is only rectangles to start with. Opacity adjustments would be a necessary function of this tool in that case._<br/>
 * _A preview or start presentation button direct from a working view of a slide would be helpful. Currently I have to back out of the working view, then select the slide I want and start the presentation from there, then stop the presentation and return to my working slide. This is a bit cumbersome._<br/>
<br/>
_If there is a cloud product marketing team I’d be happy to send feedback directly to them in the future. Just thought I’d send some thoughts your way. This is a great offering from Vectorworks and I see a lot of exciting potential with it. - Will Metcalf_

Attaching a file with a Generic Solid on which Create Contours doesn&#39;t work. (A separate wish would be making the tool work on an object like this, but for this VE I&#39;m just asking for feedback to the user that nothing happened.)

I have generally had decent success creating linetypes for my normal work, but this becomes trickier with linetypes in legends. Ideally all the letters/symbols would show up in alignment (generally the center), I&#39;m not sure how well graphic legends may have solved this?<br/>
<br/>
My idea for making linetypes smarter would be to allow the user to define the &quot;Unique segment&quot; for instance the line segments used to define center lines _________   ___   __________ (in this case the blanks and shorter middle dash) or the letters used to symbolize lines for utilities like &quot;SS&quot; for sanitary sewer, separately from the regular linetype.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than defining both the line and text together explicitly, it would be great if a user could define a linetype, generally solid or dashed in some manner, independent of the &quot;Unique segment&quot;. Once the &quot;Unique Segment&quot; was defined it should be applied algorithmically based on settings from the user.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I wouldn&#39;t want the &quot;Unique Segment&quot; to appear on any line less the 3X the length of the &quot;Unique segment&quot; and in general it should appear at 5X spacing, spaced evenly along a line segment length and to restart at corners. I&#39;m sure a dialog could be created with value fields for spacing and a checkbox for restarting at corners. It could also have a setting for lines in Annotative space to appear one time centered?

Can we please have an option to just have the Z louvre blades.  ie without the vertical infill at the outside top and at the internal bottom.<br/>
<br/>
In the Australian context louvres never have this vertical infill and I can&#39;t recall ever seeing an instance of louvres that do have it when I have been overseas.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought it must be a US context feature but in a brief web search I was unable to find any US louvres with the vertical infills.  Thus adding the requested option would appear to be valid in both the North American and Australasian contexts.

attached you will find a screencast and a VW 2023 SP4 file.<br/>
<br/>
I show how the combining process of Subdivision works at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
In the combined surface, the outer edges of the &quot;old&quot; surfaces exist<br/>
twice.<br/>
<br/>
You see, if I want to move some &quot;old&quot; outer edges, they exist twice<br/>
and are not &quot;glued&quot; together. <br/>
<br/>
I would expect that the process will check if there are unnecessary<br/>
edges and delete them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should add an option to delete those unnecessary edges,<br/>
or this should be standard?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Can someone check which version of OpenSubD is included in VW?<br/>
... or am I wrong and VW uses a different Subdivision API?<br/>
<br/>
Please see:<br/>
[https://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv/docs/release_notes.html]<br/>

… maybe we should update the version VW is using!<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The prompt to update Vectorworks appears soon after the software has been opened. This is an interruption and an imposition so users often quickly dismiss them. This results in many out-of-date installations, which brings down the average user experience and increases demand on Tech Support and reduces their availability and productivity. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Poor timing:* When users first open Vectorworks they are most keen to get onto what they opened Vectorworks to do. Applying an update at such a time would delay them, interrupt mental flow and affect productivity, so such a popup occurs as an imposition and not something that is in their interest. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*I propose that updates be announced to users under different circumstances, like so:* <br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks checks for updates in the background as usual and if they are available one or more of the following occur:<br/>
 * Vectorworks prompts to apply the updates {_}when the user next quits the application{_}.<br/>
 * When restarting Vectorworks after a crash, the update prompt appears.<br/>
 * Immediately after a crash. I realise this might require a new Helper/Service program which might not be viable. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Benefits:* <br/>
 * Applying an update on exit won&#39;t delay a user or affect productivity, except when they&#39;re closing Vectorworks before a Shutdown or Restart. If they&#39;re restarting Vectorworks to remedy an issue, updating should be part of this process anyway. <br/>
 * Prompting to update on exit will increase the propensity for users to accept update prompts.<br/>
 * More installations will be kept up-to-date, improving typical software experiences.<br/>
 * The act of applying an update can remedy some issues [even when no bug fixes relate to the issue concerned].<br/>
 * More up-to-date installations = less time will be spent submitting to Tech Support. <br/>
 * This will preserve Tech Support and VW Engineering time as there will be fewer bug submissions from users on older Service Packs. <br/>
<br/>
I posted this idea on the Vectorworks Forum as well, but it seems users in support roles are most likely to appreciate the value of this proposal. See: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/106599-prompt-to-update-vectorworks-on-exit-or-after-a-crash-but-not-when-opening/]

This option should off course be disabled by default, since most users probably don&#39;t want this, but I don&#39;t see any harm in implementing this as an option for the user.

Perimeter was fantastic because it essentially used the perimeter of the 2D shape within an extrude to &quot;Wrap&quot; a texture across adjacent faces of that extrude. This was crucial to being able to wrap textures onto backings for TV &amp; Film sets, among other things.<br/>
<br/>
Please watch this video demonstrating how it used to worked like magic, and how it&#39;s now a total pain in the butt.<br/>
<br/>
[^Video-PerimeterMappingScenario.mp4]<br/>
<br/>
Surface UV has many great uses, but it doesn&#39;t _replace_ Perimeter mapping, so Perimeter (or an equivalent) needs to be restored as an option in the mapping dropdown for object types that support it.

For the transverse profile edit mode, it always appeared in wireframe and in ortho but did not provide context. He would then rotate to a 3D view to understand which side he would want to lower/raise.<br/>

While this is not currently possible to change a discussion with [~vkitanov] suggested we may possibly be able to change something so that plants did become Entourage (no promises)<br/>

I’ve got a question:<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know the best way to export a BIM model from Archicad to VW is by an ifc export.<br/>
<br/>
But when we import that ifc into VW the re is no option to walls, doors and windows as VW walls, doors and windows, only as ifc entities. Am I correct ?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better way ?<br/>
With Revit import, the same thing happens right ?<br/>
<br/>
As far as I remember only Sketchup import has the option to transform skechup vertical solids into walls and horizontal elements into slabs.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way of doing this ?<br/>
<br/>
Doesn’t archicad have the option to convert ifc entities into it’s own walls, doors and windows ?<br/>
When can we have this feature ?<br/>
<br/>
_<br/>
<br/>
_If you can make it a wish it would be perfect._<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
_Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Jorge_<br/>

<br/>
The user raised this issue over confusion over how catalogs are supposed to work.  One main issue he raised was that it wa unclear what catalog items were and how they can be set to &quot;by style&quot; and &quot;by instance&quot;.  The Ideas and mockups in this VE are some ideas of how we could clarify some issues but we should look into this further.<br/>
<br/>
The attached mockups show some UI improvements that would:<br/>
 # Clarify that the choose from catalog icon is for choosing a catalog item.<br/>
 # Clarify that the Style toggle button for the catalog item is actually for the catalog item.<br/>
 # Clarify that the list for catalog items in the Catalog dialog is a list of &quot;catalog items&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I put the &quot;Customer Importance&quot; to &quot;High&quot; due to this very experienced user being confused by this.  Anything in the UI that can make concepts clearer is always important.<br/>
<br/>
{*}Note{*}:  I also attached the &quot;Sketch&quot; app file used for the mockups.

<br/>
After explaning where the value is coming from, the users start to work with the option ON. But it isn&#39;t always needed. In some situations the user want to have again the duplicate in the same location.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it would be great to have the two options separated with a different command. Like cmd+V for Paste and alt+cmd+V for Paste in place, it would be great to have something similar for the duplicate command. Another solution would be, to offer the option in the quick prefs of the new view bar. There it could be turned OFF or ON easily.

<br/>
customer creates about ten referenced viewports from the same source file.<br/>
Now he wants to changes the path from one of these viewports to another source file.<br/>
<br/>
To do this he has to delete the ref. viewport and create a new viewport from the new source file.<br/>
The viewport will have afterwards the same content.<br/>
<br/>
For the customer it is cumbersome to delete and create that ref. viewport.<br/>
He wishes to change the path of that one viewport to a new source.<br/>

In every architectural project there are special elements such as columns, entrance doors, foundations, etc. that can be modeled manually. This is our strength. Industries such as carpentry or interior design often consist largely of such design models.<br/>
<br/>
However, changing such objects is sometimes quite cumbersome. On one hand, the different editing options for different object types, the nesting and the different tools complicate the workflows. <br/>
We think we should take a step forward here. For example, it could be a start to support multiple editing of extrusions. In other words, combining the reshaping of the base area or raising or lowering the top and bottom edges in one and the same tool. Also path bodies with a basic geometry could be included. Path Bodies and Extrusion Bodies would fill most of the requirement and provide an incredible increase in productivity.<br/>
<br/>
Attached to this report some quiet basic geometries, created from extrudes. Also a Movie how we can change the size of the objects with the existing tools. Those existing Workflows are not unreasonable but from the view of our customers, they expect more direct and faster ways to “stretch” this kind of models.<br/>

A user must use the manage loads tool to detach association between the two objects. If a user is moving the lighting device to a new system this is fine but its more of a concern that being aware of this process is hidden to the user.<br/>
<br/>
Hanging positions whilst somewhat outdated have an excellent way of managing this problem. The blue handles that appear around the lighting devices that enable the user to instantly detach from a position is a very transparent and easy to understand workflow. I attach videos of both current workflows to compare.<br/>

We need to make this more consistant.<br/>

<br/>
The commands that would be especially great to have right in the Finder would be: Share link and Show in web portal. &quot;View&quot; is optional, because it is most likely that users are already accustomed to double-clicking to open a file or right-clicking and choosing &quot;Open with...&quot; if they are already able to select the Vectorworks file in the Finder. (And it doesn&#39;t make sense to have &quot;Show in Finder&quot; available in the Finder itself).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Share Link&quot; and &quot;Show in web portal&quot; commands in the Finder would trigger the same actions that they currently do when activated from with the VCS app, but one would not have to open the VCS window to reach the commands.<br/>
<br/>
With these commands available for VCS-hosted files, it would be even faster to share VCS-hosted files and go from the Finder (one&#39;s &quot;usual&quot; storage environment) to the the VCS portal (which they may be less accustomed to using so far). Ideally users would also then discover the further benefits of file processing that VCS can do.<br/>

Not only would having these commands available in the Finder be very useful, but they are likely expected by computer users who have become familiar with similar commands provided by other cloud storage solutions such as Dropbox and OneDrive:<br/>

<br/>
In VW 2022 and older, the Object Contextual Menu only gives you Recalculate, which performs a Recalculate All Worksheets action.<br/>
<br/>
Because worksheet criteria can hinge on the Selection State of objects, recalculating ALL worksheets can cause corruption of data when the Selection State changes. To prevent this, it would be a great feature to be able to LOCK a WS when all editing is done. This would prevent inadvertent updating when none is desired.<br/>
<br/>
If a drawing has changed significantly, the user would have complete control to LOCK or UNLOCK Worksheets and force recalculations later. Menu items could also be added to LOCK ALL or UNLOCK ALL Worksheets as a convenience to worksheet maintenance. <br/>
<br/>
I can think of a few more subtle issues, but they can be discussed at a later date.

<br/>
*It is more like a workflow issue than a bug.<br/>
Case: file consists of an architectural model and referenced IFC construction model, combined together. In the e.g. section viewport it is desired to be able to describe both architectural elements and construction parts. It is possible by using Data Tags after unlocking referenced IFC model. Unfortunately every update of the referenced file ends up in disconnection of all Data Tags connected to it. So a workflow of using external models as reference fails.<br/>
<br/>
Change in that behaviour should be taken into consideration, since in a BIM workflow, user should be able to describe all the elements inside the file, not only the native one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked with VW.INC about this during the &quot;Ask the expert&quot; session and this should be reported.

Some plugins, like the Space object, allow the user to set up which of the controls are actually shown in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a disjunct UI and it burdens the user with decisions he does not want to have to make. <br/>
<br/>
The OIP has always been a narrow and tall palette. Users are used to scrolling in it as well as folding and unfolding chunks of its controls. But is this ideal UX?<br/>
<br/>
Screen sizes are ever increasing and we now have users with wrap-around setups consisting of screens that are either very wide (and often even curved) or of multi-screen setups. At the same time, a lot of our users work on the go on laptop screens which make screen space a premium resource.<br/>
<br/>
Users on large or multiple screen setups could use a larger OIP whilst users on laptops need to be able to use a narrow, docked OIP. <br/>
<br/>
This resembles the same challenge that webdesigners had to solve when mobile devices started using browsers to access the www.<br/>
<br/>
If we could allow the OIP to become a html palette with a stylesheet for responsive content, we could enhance the appeal of this palette.<br/>
 * Enriched set of controls, like previes, draw pad, interactive custom controls.<br/>
 * Wrapping columns to reduce scrolling<br/>
 * Anchor links to get to related parts without scrolling<br/>
 * custom UI elements like clickable images, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This does not necessarily mean we need to allow each developer to brew his own stylesheet. On the contrary: by providing a standard stylesheet, we can keep the user interface of the OIP unified.

<br/>
What I want is real-world navigation physics:<br/>
 * Awareness of solid objects, default mode should be that you can&#39;t walk through them. <br/>
 * Ability to walk up stairs<br/>
 * Ability to walk through doors/gates. Or, even better, VGX would parse the model for doors/gates and animate opening them when you walk through them.<br/>
 * Ability to climb through windows, as item above<br/>
 * Ability to jump/climb over objects<br/>
 * Gravity, jump over an object and land on the surface below etc.<br/>
 * When you click on first-person mode it should set you down softly on the nearest horizontal surface with a smooth animation.<br/>
 * The viewing height should remain consistent relative to the surface you&#39;re on.<br/>
 * And perhaps with a stepping motion rather than a smooth camera effect (with the option of smooth motion), or an option for third-person navigation (i.e. you can see your character in front of you)<br/>

Right now you have to edit the Symbol withing the Ressource Manager to Change the Cadle Power for all objects. Afaik there is not possibilty to change this for each individual inserted LD, right? The user has to creat duplicates with different Candlepower to make this possible.<br/>

 <br/>
For their needs to calculate wind resistance and other structural with their truss systems, they have to export truss geometry of the truss objects to other software like Robot.<br/>
 <br/>
For that David has added wire geometry to the symbols and affected these wires to specific classes defining the tube sections to obtain the result he needs. That workflow works for all &quot;Horizontal&quot; placed objects. <br/>
But when a linear truss (for example) is flipped to &quot;Vertical&quot;, the wires disappear from the truss. This is due to the fact that Vectorworks rebuilds a new 3D symbol from the original one to show the vertical truss and it does not know about the new added &quot;wire section&quot; classes.<br/>
This is actually very problematic as he has to modify by hand each 3d symbols created on the fly by vectorworks for every document to be exported.<br/>

                Seating Section Tool Needing Refinement

<br/>
The Seating Section tool needs a bit of refinement so as to work better with non-&quot;solid-filled&quot; layouts.  At-present, allowing for things like partial aisles and sight-line/fire-marshal kills (&quot;every-day&quot; tasks for event designers/planners) is far more difficult/involved than it should be.  Things that should take a few minutes are taking hours.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file is a &quot;starting&quot; Seating Section instance and a &quot;Desired&quot; layout.  There are at least 3 ways to get from one to the other, but each has issues:<br/>
 * Manually editing the layout:  By-far the easiest method to get the desired layout but chair labels are not correct and all edits are lost if the &quot;Settings...&quot; dialog is opened.<br/>
 * 2D Clipping:  +Lots+ of trial-and-error, incorrect alignments, edits lost if the &quot;Settings...&quot; dialog is opened, chairs-per-row counts are changed if Fill Direction is changed - and more trial-and-error to fix that.<br/>
 * Aisle tool:  +Lots+ of trial-and-error to get row/chair counts correct and potential for problems if the user hides the aisles and then moves the Seating Section instance.<br/>
<br/>
My initial thought is that the Seating Section tool would be +far+ easier to use if it were more intelligent about compensating for manual edits.  (Double-click to edit...delete a chair or 2...add/move a row...etc.)

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The suggested enhancement would be to have Schematic Views of Truss use the 2D Components of the Truss Symbols based on the view of the Schematic View Object instead of a Hidden Line Rendering. It would also be great to have Schematic Views recognize geometry contained within Hanging Position Objects and utilize 2D Components of contained Truss and other symbols in a similar fashion.<br/>

These enhancements would be an effective way to optimize the Schematic View workflow using existing features in VWX.

 * It would be a document setting called _Use automatic viewport naming_ under _Document Preferences &gt; Display._<br/>
 * It would be indented under _Use automatic drawing coordination_ and would require automatic drawing coordination to be turned on (this is because without auto drawing coordination turned on it&#39;s possible to have Viewports with the same Drawing Number and Drawing Title on the same Sheet).<br/>
 * It would be off by default when converting older files to avoid overwriting Viewport names in older files when being brought forward. But it would be turned on by default in all of Vectorworks&#39; template files etc. from that version onwards.<br/>
 * Turning it on in an existing file would warn you that existing Viewport names will be overwritten, providing an opportunity to cancel. And maybe even a chance to undo the setting?<br/>
 * The default naming format would be _[sheet number] - [drawing number] - [drawing title]_<br/>
 * But Viewports would have a setting that would allow you to modify the order (so, for example, you could put the drawing title before the drawing number in some instances). You&#39;d be able to apply this setting to multiple Viewports at once (including when you have multiple Viewports selected on a Sheet or when selecting multiple Viewports in the Nav Palette or Organisation window). Each Viewport would remember its setting even if the auto-naming document preference was turned off and on again.<br/>
 * When mousing over the setting in Document Preferences the tooltip would read &quot;Automatically names viewports with the sheet number, viewport drawing number and viewport drawing title. The order of these can be modified for each viewport.&quot; <br/>
 * Ideally there would also be a document setting to modify the divider, with the default being as above: &quot; - &quot;

<br/>
*studio DWG* (name of the firm, not talking about file format DWG) is collaborating with an architecture firm on a site project containing over 40 buildings—only 3 distinct buildings (Models A, B, and C)—that are &quot;Linked&quot; into the Main Site File (see image). !Model homes duplicated across site.PNG|width=3195,height=1747! The architects are responsible for the site layout of buildings which is why this site file was shared with the landscape architecture firm, studio DWG.<br/>
<br/>
When importing this Revit master file into Vectorworks it appears to import every story of every building (+180 design layers). The user (studio DWG) was expecting Vectorworks to recognize the &quot;links&quot; as references of the buildings similar to xRef in AutoDesk dwg files that are imported into Vectorworks. Because the buildings are &quot;clones&quot;, they assumed it would import quicker rather than treating them as individual buildings upon import.<br/>
<br/>
If it is not possible to recognize &quot;links&quot; as &quot;references&quot;, is it possible to treat these links as symbols? Each building model would import as Symbol Model A, B, and C and properly be placed on the site model.<br/>

Happy to discuss this further! Thank you

The navigation palette currently shows various columns at the top of the panes for Classes, Design Layers, Sheet Layers, Viewports, Saved Views and References.<br/>
<br/>
We should be able to add our own columns to these panes.<br/>
<br/>
Classes allow us to see and sort by Visibility and Class name. I would like to add Tags or Description or the other listings possible under the filters.<br/>
<br/>
Layers allows us to sort by Visibility, layer name, stacking order and storey. I would like to see the layer&#39;s Z elevation or scale or the other listings possible under the filters.<br/>
<br/>
Same with Sheet Layers, Viewports, Saved Views and References.<br/>
<br/>
Functionally, these new columns might be accessed by right clicking on the column header and selecting choice(s) to be added from a list . These would then be added and would be sortable.<br/>
<br/>
The impetus for this enhancement request comes from me wanting to see more information at a glance. This morning I just wanted to know a layer&#39;s Z elevation without having to go through another pane to get to it. I have come up against this limitation time and again.<br/>
I think this could improve navigation palette functionality for the user.

<br/>
_&quot;The working file is named after the project file, with your *user name* appended to it, as in ProjectX_jsmith.vwxw.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion is to clearly mention where the user name is taken from. <br/>
<br/>
Some users contacting Technical Support are not sure if the user name for the Working File is taken from the OS user name, the account used to log in to Vectorworks or somewhere else. (please see attached screenshot as example)<br/>

He finds that the majority of his client meetings are virtual these days and he wants to make it easier to present a project in Vectorworks on Zoom. Things that would be necessary in Presentation Mode would be annotations, cropping views of what is shared, the ability for cursor to enlarge, a workspace change where palettes can be removed, preference changes like turning off the visibility of light objects, dirty viewport indicators, etc. Most importantly, Any annotations that were created would be saved to a document that can be shared with a client.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The new Draped Hardscape feature, combined with the ability for Hardscapes to cut Site Models, provides a really powerful new workflow. Site Modifier objects can be added to modify the Site Model, then Hardscapes in Draped configuration-only can be added with &quot;Cut the site model&quot; enabled. This gives a ton more flexibility since a Hardscape&#39;s elevations can now be controlled through multiple independent modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
When using this workflow, one issue I encounter is that it can often be hard to tell what exactly your Site Modifiers are doing once the Hardscapes are cutting the Site Model. I&#39;ve attached an image and file that show an example.<br/>
<br/>
Updating the Site Model also takes much longer when the cutout shapes are being accounted for, so fiddling with the modifiers to get the desired Site Model shape can be really time-consuming.<br/>
<br/>
One option is to turn off the Hardscapes using the Site Model&#39;s &quot;Include Modifiers on Layer:&quot; settings, but this isn&#39;t really intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the user would be able to toggle on/off the Hardscape cutting with a checkbox in the Site Model&#39;s OIP. This way they could tweak their modifiers quickly, see clearly what the effects are, then turn the cutting back on with one click.

 * I&#39;d like support for split levels built directly into the Stories feature.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Reason:*<br/>
 * For projects with split levels (floors on the same storey with different heights) we currently have to create multiple Level Types (e.g. FFL-0, FFL-200, FFL-300) to deal with each split level (and the same goes for projects files with multiple buildings at different heights).<br/>
 * This adds an enormous amount of complexity to an already complex feature.<br/>
 * I don&#39;t think Level Types is the right place to provide this capability.<br/>
 * It means that any standard Level Types one would typically have in a model (e.g. FFL) need to be multiplied by the number of split levels you have (e.g. FFL-0, FFL-200, FFL-300), creating unnecessary complexity and management overhead.<br/>
 * If we want to control top and bottom bindings by Wall Style it means multiplying all our Wall Styles so they can bind to the relevant Level Types (FFL-0, FFL-200, FFL-300) and then you have the issue of visually identifying these different Wall Styles to make sure they don&#39;t end up being used on the wrong split level.<br/>
 * And/or it means we can&#39;t copy a wall across from one part of the building to another without being forced to redefine the top and bottom bindings to suit that level<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Possible Solution:*<br/>
 * Story Groups<br/>
 * Each group of storeys could have its own elevations defined independently of other storeys<br/>
 ** *Story Group 0:* Story-0-0, Story-1-0, Story-2-0<br/>
 ** *Story Group 200:* Story-0-200 Story-1-200, Story-2-200<br/>
 ** *Story Group 300:* Story-0-300, Story-1-300, Story-2-300<br/>
 * That would allow us to maintain standard Level Types (e.g. FFL-0) that would work across Story Groups (e.g. FFL-0 would be the same definition across split levels, and the Storey Group would control any elevation height difference between split levels.)<br/>
 * Which means we could have Wall Styles with top and bottom bindings defined by Level Type that work across split levels.<br/>
 * And/or we could copy a wall from one split level to another and not be forced to redefine the top and bottom bindings<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Result:*<br/>
 * The result, when dealing with split levels, would mean less Level Types, less Wall Styles and less manual manipulation of top and bottom bindings.

<br/>
• Can extrude multiple 2D shapes at once by selecting them all and using Extrude command. They become one extrude. You can Ungroup the Extrude to break it into individual extrudes, one for each 2D shape.<br/>
<br/>
• Cannot extrude multiple 2D shapes when those shapes are on different planes, since this is at odds with the previous bullet point. If you attempt this, you get a pop-up error that says &quot;The objects being operated on must be in the same plane.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Desired functionality:<br/>
<br/>
• Add the ability to extrude multiple shapes that are on different planes. Instead of &quot;trying&quot; to create one Extrude, Vectorworks should just go ahead and make a separate extrude for each object. So if I had seven shapes selected, all on different planes, I could run the extrude command and get seven separate extrudes. Each would extrude from the plane of the object.<br/>
<br/>
• As it stands, a user must individually select each of the seven shapes and run the Extrude command for each one manually. This is a lot of clicking.<br/>
<br/>
• Now imagine that you&#39;ve already laid out hundreds of rectangles in 3D space and want to give thickness to them all, by extruding them a uniform amount. This SHOULD be possible with one command. But it&#39;s not. Attached is an example file showing this scenario (which I happen to be in, sadly).

The examples I have attached depict a limitation when it comes to displaying data in worksheets with nested objects (parts). I have used the speaker tool as an analogy purely because it’s the simplest way to explain the required workflow. <br/>
<br/>
NB This is not an enhancement request to the speaker tool.<br/>
<br/>
So In example 1 we can see 4 line arrays that each contain speaker cabinets. I cannot find a user-friendly way to show each speaker array object and then see in collapsible rows beneath it all of the speakers suspended from that array. There may be a way to do this but it is not obvious to a user. Displaying a single worksheet of parent items containing children in an easy pre-formatted way does not seem to be straightforward. Currently I have to create multiple worksheets to display this data.<br/>
<br/>
Example 2 the source of this request was a customer who is designing exhibition booths who for example has a &#39;Back Wall&#39; and wants to report that in order to create the back wall the supplier needs. In my mock up you can see I have the following....<br/>
<br/>
6x Omni 55 992x2480<br/>
2x Omni 992x992<br/>
12 Connector Clip Hardware.<br/>
<br/>
In this case these are symbols however they don&#39;t always have the same record attached which I guess is what I really asking. The ability to display connected objects in a kinematic chain relationship, those objects to be able to display fields from different records/PIO Parameters.<br/>

 # Provide better *dimensioning, inference, and locking to axes* when 3D freeform modeling, similar to SketchUp (Chris).<br/>
 # Allow for the *selection and moving of edges and vertices* of 3D objects, similar to Sketchup (Chris)<br/>
 # *Control points for slab drainage* need to be more clear. (Chris)<br/>
 # Ability to enter a “{*}project height{*}” which would be connected to storeys, elevation benchmarks, etc. This would also be able to accommodate old survey heights on record and should be able to be easily updated to new standards without the risk of damaging the BIM. (Greg, Simon)<br/>
 # A way to see the different types of stake objects when the project architect does QA on a file (Simon). This may be accomplished using data viz – TBD in follow-up conversation with customer.<br/>
 # Explanation or *clarification of render settings* directly in the application without having to source the information elsewhere. (Paul)<br/>
 # More obvious *rendering and PDF presets* to create “lite” or faster results. (Paul, Greg)<br/>
 # Ability to {*}calculate average grade{*}. Ability to show average grade as a separate entity that was not affected by storeys (Simon, Paul)<br/>
 # {*}Generative AI for schematic design / massing{*}. (Paul)<br/>
 # *Checkouts of objects during project sharing* was not so “sensitive” and did not have so many inter-relationships (Ryan)<br/>
 # More stability when {*}symbols are within symbols{*}, which is being done to achieve “{*}unit symbols{*}”. A purpose-built {*}Unit Plan resource{*}. (Paul)<br/>
 # A “{*}scene graph{*}” type view for symbols within symbols. i.e Unit plans. (Chris)<br/>
 # The ability to *compare two sheets/set of sheets/models* and have the differences highlighted, similar to Bluebeam Revu’s “Compare Documents” feature”. (Simon)<br/>
 # *Redline tool* to have a tag or category that allows for indicating what stage/phase it was added to a design. This is needed because quite often the Authority having Jurisdiction wants to see ALL changes bubbled but consultants only want to see changes since the last issued set. Using classes for this is a way to do this but it results in MANY classes in a file. It was also implied that having the redline and revision cloud objects have a 3D presence or state would be useful for BIM work. (Simon)<br/>
 # Add a “{*}recent selections{*}” history list to the Custom Selection dialog. (Paul)<br/>
 # Ability to *check the quality or integrity of a VWX file* for corrupted or unnecessarily complex objects. (Paul, Chris)<br/>
 # {*}IFC exports{*}: More clarity (in-application) on the best export settings to send to Revit to reduce the “experimentation” time. (Chris)<br/>
 # Better ability to *evaluate carbon* in a project, especially when it comes to concrete. A user friendly tool. An “Energos” for Carbon would be great. (Simon)<br/>
 # An equivalent to {*}designPH but for Vectorworks{*}. The ability to export from Vectorworks to PHPP (Chris, Paul)<br/>
 # The ability to compare different energos project setups or embodied carbon material options *and their costs* to each other within Vectorworks (Simon, Chris)<br/>
 # *Massing models* objects to have the ability to set individual floor to floor heights for each story. (Chris)<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Could it generate Structural members in stead of &#39;dumb&#39; extrudes so that it was BIM compatible and would it be possible with all the shiny new viewports and things we have for it to automagically make a plan viewport (maybe a horizontal secion?), hidden line elevations for each wall and dimension them all on a chosen sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially what it does now in terms of appearance but as &#39;live&#39; drawings rather than completely separate things. Then if you add more studs or change the position or anything about them the views would all be up to date and it could export to IFC with all that lovely data with no extra effort unless more info is wanted.<br/>
<br/>

Probably this could be extended to Roofs and Slabs for consistency<br/>

                Project Sharing Server: Docker Images and documentation should be available through the Docker Repository
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Often used Docker images are usually available through the Docker registry. Docker images also come with a link to their Docker repository page by default.<br/>
<br/>
The current Project Sharing Server manual has the user download the Vectorworks installation package (currently over 6GB) to then extract a tar file of less than 90MB in size. Then the user has to get that file to the NAS to import the image and create a container.<br/>
<br/>
This situation is aggravated by the fact, that these are several steps that require different people, because the IT that does the Docker steps usually does not have a customer service portal account to download the installation file, which has to be done by the customer.<br/>
<br/>
The repository page link of the Docker image points to:<br/>
[https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/project-sharing-server/]<br/>
<br/>
which is a page not found (404). See screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison the link included for the Jira software image points to:<br/>
[https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/jira-software/]<br/>
<br/>
which has all the information necessary. See screenshot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Therefore the proposal is simple:<br/>
* setup a Vectorworks repository on Docker repository<br/>
* setup a repository page for the Project Sharing Server Docker image<br/>
* make the Docker image available through the Docker image registry<br/>
<br/>
&gt; No more downloading 6GB for less than 90MB.<br/>
&gt; No more file transfer between customer and IT.<br/>
&gt; No more looking for the manual. It&#39;s right where it should be: in the Docker repository page.

When using ChatGTP to generate Python or Vectorscript mistakes occur. If you click the &#39;View Error output&#39; button you can see which lines have problems.<br/>

However none of this is able to be copied, and so it is laborious to re write this back into ChatGTP in order to correct the script.<br/>

The wish is that the error text is able to be copied in order to be used in another application such as Chat GTP.<br/>

Since we have quite a few different sheets, the possibility to save sheet sets is great.<br/>
<br/>
What would be even better is search function as used in the sheet organization window.<br/>
(The same probably holds for the Publish dialog, where a search function might interessting.)<br/>

If such a window or door is inserted in drawing, the customer record is automatically attached.<br/>
This is not working for wall style.<br/>
Wish that a custom record can be attached to a wall.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
After successfully importing an ifc file provided by an architect containing rooms (spaces) i would be more than happy to use the data already placed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
i am talking from an av company point of view.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
workflow example 1 open bim process: <br/>
<br/>
when placing my symbols inside the room (space) it would be very helpful to transfer the name of the room into my symbol. i don’t want to rebuild all rooms coming with the ifc file with native vwx rooms an name them by hand. the actual project i am referring to has 2804 rooms.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
workflow example 2 open bim process:<br/>
<br/>
after importing an ifc file provided by an architect containing rooms (spaces) there will be a change. all  (or just two) room names will contain letters instead of numbers. <br/>
<br/>
how could i update these informations without placing new data tags, writing all room names into my symbols by hand, etc??<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I love the bim idea but obviously there are some stones in my  (and others) way.<br/>

Not sure if this is WAD. That said, it is expected that if a filter can be selected in the Class Options, there should be a different result based on the filter selected.

Unfortunately, the slab 2D attributes are controlled either manually or by the slab object class. This means that there need to be separate slab object classes for slabs that are different materials which does not fit with standard architectural classing structures, or the attributes have to be set by object. Attributes that are set by object cannot be controlled via class overrides, so this is not a good solution. I would propose adding the ability to control the 2D attributes of a slab using a separate class, like the hardscape tool and the space tool. Both of these objects can have an object class AND a 2D attributes class.

They would like to see an option to select a year for Revit Export similar to what is shown in DWG Export. At present, they work with an architecture firm using Revit 2022 requiring them to work in Vectorworks 2022 since Vectorworks 2023 only currently exports to Revit 2023. Perhaps being able to select 1 or 2 years behind will suffice.

                Bluebeam Integration Update
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The current Bluebeam Integration is based on Bluebeam Studio. Within Bluebeam Studio the exchange of information will happen over Studio Sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Last year Bluebeam released it&#39;s Cloud based version &quot;Revu 21&quot;. In this new subscription based licensing model, the workflows move away from the Studio Sessions to PDF editing and commenting directly in the browser on the Bluebeam Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
With a VCS Bluebeam Integration update it would be great if the users would have a way to:<br/>
<br/>
- Share PDFs between VCS and the Bluebeam Cloud<br/>
<br/>
- Publish PDF directly in VCS and the Bluebeam Cloud<br/>
<br/>
- Sync comments between PDFs in VCS and the Bluebeam Cloud<br/>
<br/>
- Support redlining from Bluebeam to the drawing in VW<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently, the redlining parts needs to be done manually over different platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Current situation:<br/>
<br/>
1. VW User draws plans in Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
2. PDF will be exported and sent to the supervisor<br/>
<br/>
3. Supervisor opens PDF in Bluebeam and adds comments<br/>
<br/>
4. A list of comments and todos can be exported from Bluebeam as a PDF<br/>
<br/>
5. Supervisor sends the list of todos and the commented PDFs back to the VW user<br/>
<br/>
6. The VW user now needs to check the list manually to make the changes in the plans<br/>
<br/>
(6.a. Maybe the commented PDF plans needs to be imported with the checkbox &quot;Show Annotations&quot; enabled. But this is visual only. There is no additional information on the comments like in Bluebeam)<br/>
<br/>
7. The VW user needs to inform the supervisor about updates to the comments (Pending, Information needed, Done etc.).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
With an improved Bluebeam integration that could be much more fluid workflow:<br/>
<br/>
1. VW User draws plans in Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
2. PDF will be published and directly shared in the Bluebeam Cloud<br/>
<br/>
3. Supervisor adds comments in the Bluebeam Cloud<br/>
<br/>
4. The VW user will have the comments directly in VCS too and they could be show directly in the original Vectorworks plan on the correct location to change the plans accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
5. The VW user can update the status of the comments directly in Vectorworks (Pending, Information needed, Done etc.) and the supervisor will be informed in real-time in the Bluebeam Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A similar functionality already exists in Vectorworks with the BCF Manager in 3D models if the BCF is connected to a supported server.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Change the &quot;Elevation&quot; in the OIP<br/>
<br/>
Note that the value changes, but the Hardscape fails to move.<br/>
<br/>
- Now Undo the change<br/>
- Go to a Front view and drag the Hardscape to a new elevation, or run the &quot;Move 3D&quot; command and move along the Z axis<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the elevation can be changed, and the OIP &quot;Elevation&quot; field even updates to show the change.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that, if the elevation can be changed by dragging or using the Move 3D command, it should also work when changing the &quot;Elevation&quot; setting.<br/>
<br/>
This is a regression from VW 2022. The same thing happens going back to 2023 SP0.

—allow a custom post at beginning and end that is distinct from other posts<br/>
<br/>
—come with a library of accessible standards-compliant returns for starting and end posts (that can accommodate any slope of ramp or angle of stair), for a variety of markets/building codes

The Railing / Fence Tool is a very easy tool to quickly draw the fence of a plot. Especially when dealing with large distances. Using separate symbols for this is much more work.<br/>
<br/>
However, this tool has some limitations in the parameters, so you cannot create everything, including common fences.<br/>
The picture shows an example of such a case There are still several variations to make in terms of plank width. But the main thing is that you can build the fence in 3 layers.<br/>
Front, back and the layer in between to connect them. Both in horizontal and / or vertical.

Drawing a Railing/Fence(3D Line Mode) in Top/Plan view does not automatically put the Railing/Fence on the Site model. To do so one needs to use the command Send to Surface. This gives the whole object one Z-value. This is different behavior then when drawing the Railing/Fence(3D Line Mode) in a 3D View where parameters Height point 1 and 2 snap to the height of the Site Model.<br/>
Now one has to first set a Stake at both endpoint to know the height, try to remember what was point 1 and 2 (as the direction of the path lost), adjust Height point 1 and 2 in the OIP according to the stakes AND remove the Z value.<br/>

Currently, we can have different parts placed on a terrain model (DTM).<br/>
1. Because the tool itself can do this, e.g. Existing tree tool.<br/>
2. By allowing an object to connect to the underlying terrain model via the Sent to Serface command (3D polygon).<br/>
<br/>
The Railing/Fence Tool gives the user a comprehensive ability to model and parametrically modify fences without making the model very heavy. It is useful in 2D because you can draw it as a Polyline. This extended option does not exist for drawing in 3D. Here you can only draw a 3D line option.<br/>
<br/>
By being able to draw the Railing/Fence in 2D plan and then place it on the terrain model via the Sent to Surface command. Would be a great improvement and addition.<br/>
The option to replace 3D line with 3D Polygon would also give the user more freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it should be possible to deform and move the Railing/Fence in 3D with the Reshape Tool. In a similar way as you can do a NURBS. Fixing an axis such as the Z axis. Add and remove control points.

If you draw a hardscape in an empty document, the 2D fill is set by a dedicated class by default. This duality is unnecessary complicated for simple drawings and confusing to beginning users.

<br/>
Currently, Vectorworks does not have the ability for an object&#39;s layer to change while ensuring its Z position is retained. If the layers have different Z origins, most objects will move their Z position when moved to another layer. Examples object are the +roof object+ and +aligned hardscape+ with internal Surface Modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it is desirable to changes an object&#39;s layer. In most cases, the *+hard fought for+* Z location should not change but it will. The Z location will change by the distance between the two layers&#39; Z origins.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs a &quot;Lock Position&quot; function. Currently, we have the &quot;Lock&quot; function. It retains an object&#39;s X,Y,Z position but also locks all other aspects of of an object, including its layer. The layer of a locked object cannot be changed.<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;Lock Position&quot; function would retain the object&#39;s X,Y,Z position while allowing the other characteristics of an object to be changed, including its layer. This would allow an object to be moved to another layer, retain its Z value and, importantly, its constraints with other objects.<br/>
<br/>
For users who work in 3D there are many challenges and many, many rewards. In my opinion, working in 3D is the best workflow. This one inability of Vectorworks unnecessarily frustrates the user&#39;s 3D workflow. It is, so seemingly, easy to remedy.<br/>
<br/>
The current workaround of group / ungroup on the active, target layer works to retain the object&#39;s Z location but is cumbersome and threatens an object&#39;s constraints with other objects. <br/>
<br/>
Kindly develop a &quot;Lock Position&quot; or similar functionality in Vectorworks.

To reproduce, move the Hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Hardscape is no longer draped on the Site Model surface, and the only way to get it to re-drape is to manually reset it somehow (ex: changing an option and then changing it back).<br/>
<br/>
This might be more of a wish than a bug, but it seems like there should be an OIP button to allow the Hardscape to be re-draped on the Site Model, similar to the &quot;Realign&quot; button for Aligned Hardscapes. The alternative of manually forcing a reset by changing options isn&#39;t very intuitive. <br/>
<br/>
Enabling support in the &quot;Send to Surface&quot; command might also be a good way to get these to reset in a more natural way.

<br/>
It also seems like it&#39;ll be pretty common for users to want to duplicate the exact profile shape of their modifiers and use them in Hardscapes. Currently this can be done by entering the Site Modifier path mode, copying the source shape, then exiting and pasting-in-place, then converting the shape to a Hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty tedious process, and it seems like it would be really useful to add a command that allows the user to do this with one click. Ideally they could just right-click on a Site Modifier (or a multiple-selection of Site Modifiers), run a command from the context menu, and it would create Hardscapes directly over top of the modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
The user could then use Add/Clip Surface or Reshape to quickly refine the shape, if it needs to be different from the modifier&#39;s shape.

This is a really powerful ability in my experience, especially now that we have Draped Hardscapes that can fit neatly to the Site Model surface. Getting the right shape with the existing Site Modifier tool configurations can be tricky and time-consuming, especially when it comes to curved areas that have elevation changes.<br/>
<br/>
The issue is that this ability is hidden from the user and isn&#39;t very intuitive to use. They need to know to reassign the class and need to use other tools that generally fall outside of Landmark.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few ways I think this could be made a lot more discoverable and usable:<br/>
<br/>
- Add a new NURBS mode to the Site Modifier tool, that would allow the user to draw NURBS Curves with the existing NURBS Curve tool behavior. These would automatically act as modifiers so no class change would be needed. Modes for 3D Polygons and 3D Loci could theoretically also be added, but aren&#39;t as important.<br/>
<br/>
- Add a Landmark menu command that would allow NURBS Curves, NURBS Surfaces (and possibly 3D Polygons and 3D Loci) to be converted directly to Site Modifiers. &quot;Create Objects from Shapes&quot; won&#39;t work since it only supports 2D shapes. It could be named something like &quot;Create Site Modifier from 3D Object&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
- Add a new Configuration for Site Modifier objects for these new types of modifiers. It could just be a single new configuration named something like &quot;Custom 3D&quot; that encompasses all four types of 3D objects (NURBS Curve, NURBS Surface, 3D Polygon, 3D Locus). We would probably have to restrict some options and abilities (like changing the config from Custom 3D to another one) but it seems like it might be doable.<br/>
<br/>
Further in the future, I think it would also be a really useful feature to allow other 3D object types (like Extrudes, Solid Subtractions, etc) to be supported as modifiers. These could also fall under a &quot;Custom 3D&quot; configuration.<br/>

In some situations it would be great to have this option also for rectangles. Right now, the rectangles are drawn anytime clockwise.

It is my wish that the import OBJ dialogue be more explicit as to what it means by the &#39;Units in File&#39; at the bottom. Unless a user reads the Help text when hovering, there is no way to know that this refers to the OBJ file&#39;s units.

Anything to make it more intuitive rather than most likely letting the object come in at the wrong size and having to be re-scaled. Mock up enclosed.<br/>

<br/>
currently, a section is a 2D-object only.<br/>
<br/>
To better understand the cut in 3D space, you need more information, such as the height of the cut plane, or which objects are currently being cut by the section (as provided by the clip cube).<br/>
<br/>
The 2D section in Vectorworks is only an abstract representation<br/>
of a three-dimensional section. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to see sections be interactive 3D planes<br/>
that show the current cut of the 3D model.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wishes in detail<br/>
 * Workflow: draw line, polygon, … and push/pull to needed height<br/>
or click on a surface to place the section there.<br/>
 * live-cut of 3D-model<br/>
 * 3d plane as visual representation of section<br/>
 * interactive sizing and moving of 3D-section<br/>
 * show semi transparent 3D-plane as section,<br/>
option to show hatches of PIO, 3D-objects <br/>
 * on/off mode = section active or not active<br/>
 * show 3d-section-planes / don&#39;t show 3D-section-planes<br/>
 * Ability to have more on/active sections at the same time<br/>

Attaches you see a video of Sketchup and the solution of<br/>
sections there. I like the options and would love to see them<br/>

The new photogrammetry within Nomad is amazing! I just used it and uploaded 18 photos but over 60 files then were added to my VCS folder. These files are alien to users with suffixes such as : gravity.txt/HEIC/depth.tif<br/>
<br/>
As you can see from the snapshot it is a mess and all users will have to organise or delete the files apart from the two &#39;Result&#39; OBJ and USDZ files. It makes finding the USDZ file very difficult as there are so many files loose in the VCS folder.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that when adding photos users were prompted to place them in a folder, or to make a folder in order for them all to go into. I realise if there&#39;s an existing one users can choose that. <br/>

<br/>
Project-Tool feels a little outdated and untouched.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the workflow is to project a 2D-shape<br/>
or a Nurbs-curve to another 3D-object.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would find it useful to have the ability to project<br/>
also 3D-objects to other 3d-objects,<br/>
like Nurbs-surfaces/solids to Subdivisions or vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
The wished workflow could be to have a project-surface mode,<br/>
in which you can pick a surface from an existing 3d-object<br/>
and select a target-object or -surface to project it.     <br/>
<br/>
Attached you find video from Sketchup, where I use<br/>
a Plugin from Christina Eneroth. Plugin is called: Eneroth Aling Face.<br/>
The worflow is fast, easy and fun to use.<br/>
<br/>
https://forums.sketchup.com/t/eneroth-align-faces/54798 <br/>
<br/>
You can align/project existing surfaces to the orientation of other surfaces.<br/>
The improvement for 3D modelling would be huge!<br/>

                T02353 - Design Layer Render Options Affect Viewport Previews
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a few Viewports that are rendered in Shaded and RW. The file has &quot;Saved Viewport Cache&quot; disabled.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Render in Shaded mode<br/>
- Now go to the Shaded Options and disable Textures and Colors<br/>
- Switch to the sheet layer<br/>
<br/>
Note that the viewport previews don&#39;t show textures/colors, even though they&#39;re enabled in those viewports&#39; render options.<br/>
<br/>
So it seems like the viewport previews are always applying the Shaded options that are in-use on the design layer. The same thing can be seen with the Draw Edges render option.<br/>
<br/>
As F3 of the task doc states, the previews are just approximations, so it&#39;s possible that this is WAD and was done intentionally (I could see how it might help performance). It seems a little jarring with textures/colors though, so thought it was worth mentioning.

<br/>
The error message says &quot;The selected activation options can&#39;t be used for this object. Please click on an object which has all the selected options as parameters&quot; which occurs when one or more of the parameters in the Tool Preferences don&#39;t actually apply to the object you click on (for example having &quot;Symbol Name&quot; checked when clicking on a Line).<br/>
<br/>
This is needlessly constricting. It would be much more user-friendly if the tool were improved so that when you click on an object that doesn&#39;t have +all+ of the checked parameters, it would still Select Similar objects based on checked parameters that are {+}relevant to the clicked object{+}. And perhaps in the lower right-hand corner a red message would alert the user that &quot;Some Select Similar options were ignored.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, the error pop-up doesn&#39;t even tell you +which+ parameters don&#39;t apply to the clicked object, so it can be sort of a guessing game to make sure you turn off all of the ones. The tool should automatically ignore irrelevant parameters.<br/>
<br/>
As a demonstrative example, if I go into the Select Similar Tool Preferences and check 1) Object Type, 2) Pen Thickness, and 3) Symbol Name, then use the tool and click on a Line, the tool should ignore Symbol Name and still select all other Line objects with the matching thickness. <br/>
<br/>
This would make the tool more useful and less limiting.<br/>
<br/>
Hypothetically, a user could keep +all+ the Tool Preferences checked and it would use as many as are relevant to the object that you click on (at least as a starting point, then of course a user can go in and make more specific preferences as desired). But please get rid of that warning pop-up and make the tool work more seamlessly.

As soon as the user adds a lighting object to the document, the default light turns off.<br/>
<br/>
While there is some logic to this – Vectorworks assumes that when light are added, the user is now lighting with intent — this behavior can be confusing as there is no feedback as to what is happening or what to control that light. Additionally, the user may not realize that they are adding a render light when adding a PIO or symbol containing a light. This particularly applies to inserting Spotlight Lighting Devices, where users may not ever intend to turn on the lights in a render but still want 3D modeling capabilities. This is a frequent question on the chat boards, when speaking with students, and discussing rendering during user groups.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, users cannot turn the default light back on, with the only recourse adding a shadowless directional light to the model, which may be the only time the user needs tp deal with lighting objects.<br/>
<br/>
A solution would be to have a preference called Default light behavior, with the options: Automatic, Never, and Always. The default, Automatic, would mimic current behavior. Additionally, the first automatically turning off the light gets triggered, VW should provide a dialog altering the user that the default light is now off and where to find the preference affecting this behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally (or alternatively), the default light could appear at the top of the Visualization palette.

<br/>
I think it would be nice to have more options for the &quot;Object Info&quot;-palette.<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
We need more options to define what we want to so see in the<br/>
&quot;Object Info&quot; and some small options for doing a little layout (divide line, …).<br/>
<br/>
Use Case:<br/>
<br/>
PIO Object e.g. Walls:<br/>
<br/>
I want to see the Gross / Net: Area, Volume, …  of my active wall<br/>
in the &quot;Object Info&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If I select more walls, I want to see the combined area, volume<br/>
of all selected walls.<br/>
<br/>
Same for slabs, roofs, …<br/>
<br/>
For 2D objects, I can get combined information like area and perim,<br/>
but not for 3D objects or PIO!<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, it isn&#39;t also possible to get the volume of a 3D object<br/>
in the &quot;Object Info&quot;!  Is the volume calculation too complex for a<br/>
instant background calculation?<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
Layout<br/>
<br/>
UI-Scaling is necessary!<br/>
Some text is so small I can&#39;t read. This can lead to errors!<br/>
<br/>
The used font (for the whole UI in VW) isn&#39;t perfect to read.<br/>
Maybe you should discuss, to change the UI-Font, to a better<br/>
readable font!<br/>
<br/>
With some bold fonts, you can make something more important.  <br/>
<br/>
 Can we have colors for text, or to categorize some info parts?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve modified all my trusses librairies with 3D lins inside. Each line as a special class name with its section and material, for example ASD Round 50x3 alu EN AW 6005 T6, ... <br/>
<br/>
I export only those classes, so only lines, in DWG-DXF, that I can open in Robot or Rstab, RWind and be able to calculate wind effect, tilting, sliding, ... and produce a legal document.<br/>
<br/>
The issue is that when I set an horizontal truss (or angle or...) in vertical or other angled position, VWX create a new 3D truss symbol, but that new symbol doesn&#39;t include all my special lines inside with special classes. And it is not possible to put those lines in a classic vectorworks classes because we need that thousand lines comes in Robot or Rstab with specifics layers to be distinct by section and material. See my attached file and screenshot.<br/>

                A UI to create formatted DMX Patchlists within VW
    </p>
</td>

Long story <br/>
<br/>
New users often ask me if there is an easy and pretty way to format DMX Patch lists. Ofcourse we can make worksheets, but if you want to make it pretty with fixture and Universe summary&#39;s and subheaders between each fixture type or universe for instance. Then this would take multiple database rows and would not dynamically add another data base row if another instrument type is added. Maybe with this task and the graphic legends being availible, such a UI to create pretty DMX patchlists could be made as well?<br/>
 <br/>
I know how to deal with the above myself, I have a script that creates these worksheets, but new users would almost expect such functionality. It&#39;s a feedback I often hear from students. (I know the first answer might be Lightwright, but people do not use that over here, or only marginally)<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a VWX file containing a number of different types of Lighting Devices. They are patched with DMX addresses on different Universes. I created a script &quot;Patchlist Fixture &amp; Universe&quot; that can make two worksheets, A DMX patchlist &#39;by fixture&#39; and one &#39; By Universe&#39;. The worksheets have multiple database rows and can be seen as an axample of what elements such a Patchlist should and could contain. Elements are:<br/>
<br/>
1: A header with the project name. This information comes from the title block border<br/>
<br/>
2: A subheader with more details about the project also from the title block border. Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use<br/>
<br/>
3: A fixture summary based on Lighting device record summarized by instrument type. Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use, such as DMX footprint etc, or even user fields.<br/>
<br/>
4:A universe summary based on Lighting device record summarized by universe. Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use, such as DMX footprint etc. Also a total parameters used count is usefull here. Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use<br/>
<br/>
5A: A database row with a header for each universe with the universe number as criteria in each subsequent database row. There should be as many database rows as there are universes. I Added a worksheet function to caluclate the last free DMX channel in the universr (thanks to help from Pat Stanford on the forum :-)<br/>
Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use or not<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
5B: A database row with a header for each instrument Type with the instrument Type as criteria in each subsequent database row. There should be as many database rows as there are instrument Type. However in my worksheet I chose to filter by Channel ranges from 1 to 100, 101 to 200, 201 to 300 and so on. (dividing channels numbers in this way is very common place)  <br/>
For two reasons. Dimmers often control different types of instrument types and are given the same channel range througout the dimmer. The second reason is that the &#39;By Channel&quot; will sort the Lighting devices in order of channel number<br/>
Would be great if a user could specify which columns to use or not<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
5C: Perhaps the above is actually 3 options in stead of two, a possible patchlist by: 1 universe, 2 instrument type, 3 channel ranges (ranges of 100 or 1000)<br/>
<br/>
If the above is a preformated report, there needs to be an error checking if Universe or instrument types are added or removed. In that case data base rows need to be added or removed so the tool needs to be run again. In my sheet I added formulae to display a red warning that the script needs to be run again. Could this be done dynamically?<br/>
<br/>
Also perhaps the above could be done better and dynamically if this was not a preformatted report, but a DMX Patchlist plug in object? Worksheets are still difficult to understand for new users. They should learn them eventually, but I notice new users expect more UI for these features and I need to manage their expectations. <br/>

Hello, currently fcSpace will be converted to Space PIO only if its geometry is extrude in Vectorworks. If the geometry is &#39;BRep&#39; or another, it will be imported as an Ifc-Object. However, there are many Cad-Programs that export the Ifc-Spaces with geometries other than extrude. It would be desirable for the customer here that the Ifc-Space import would be imported into Vectorworks as a Space in all cases (all geometries).<br/>
Here are a few test files for development<br/>

The P/P-Tool frequently don&#39;t know which side of which object<br/>
I want to push/pull (p/p), often the tool wants to p/p the wrong surface.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly solve the problem by making a group of the object<br/>
and p/p inside the group. After the p/p, I ungroup my object.<br/>
<br/>
An idea to “solve” the problem could be to prioritize the active<br/>
object for the P/P-Tool, that the active object is more in focus<br/>
for the tool, then the inactive objects.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
In attached video and file. Here you find a  rotation situation in plan rotation mode. The issue is that the object in the OIP is shown 0.17 degrees. When using the rotation tool to rotate the objects to 0.00 the rotate tool says it&#39;s 0.00. In fact, the object is rotated 0.17 degrees. This is confirmed by change the parameter in the OIP to zero.<br/>
<br/>
In my daily use of the plan rotation I experience multiple small rotation inaccuracies. I already changed the precision factor, but no luck so far.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Can you please have a look to confirm the issue? I&#39;ve made a saved view with the  new &quot;center orientation&quot;.

We already had situations in which for any reason a Customer removed the Updater or it was broken and this warning makes the Customer think that their Vectorworks Version is up to date, while it is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
In case the VWVersion.txt is also missing, Vectorworks/Updater should be able to generate a new one. The Updater is totally dependent of this file to see if it needs a new Update or not. In the case this file is missing, should exist some sort of action to be able to generate a new file.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this and implement this pop-up warning Pop-as soon as possible. Thank you in advance.

To study different object / material variations during the design phase in the project, it would be great if with the Data Visualization specific placeholder Materials could be overwritten with another Materials.<br/>
<br/>
Example: To check different variations of wall colors and furniture textures only the materials can be exchanged through the Data Visualization. Currently, this needs to be done with many additional clicks by overwrite the fill and texture to the desired look.

But architects are equally interested in how structural members interface with adjacent objects.<br/>

To enable this we need more anchor points and reshape handles than the current centre-only one. <br/>

For example say I want to shape a cranked beam to match the pitch of a timber roof structure by following the bottom edge of the timbers. At the moment, in a side view, I have to do that shaping the member using the centre grab handles, and then move the beam down into place. But if I there were reshape handles to the top of the beam I could shape the beam directly in place and not need to move it down afterwards.

Then you have to go fix it manually using the Attribute Mapping Tool (unless that object type is restricted from using that tool, of course).<br/>
<br/>
At least when it comes to flat/non-curved surfaces, the code should be fixed so that the texture plane always defaults to the same plane as the selected surface, since this is the intended result 98% of the time. The surface normal can be used for computing this automatic alignment.<br/>
<br/>
Updating this would save lots of time in the texture process.<br/>

<br/>
Attached is an example of an object where the two surfaces with the {_}Soffit Triple 4&quot; Center Ventilated R{_}T texture were recently set to Plane mapping, but an odd plane was automatically chosen (in this case I think the texture planes are aligned with the front view of the overall object).

We need the ability to set a surface plane in symbols so that when they are sent to they surface they have the ability to &quot;conform&quot; (tilt) to any simple planar slope they may land on. The reddit post shows an image with multiple cars, the wheels against the curb are &quot;floating&quot; because the road is crowned. The same thing happens with benches and sloped paving. Additionally, I would like the ability to set a &quot;Surface Plane&quot; within a symbol for items that might extend below the surface of a site model or similar like fence posts, embedded furniture or excavated elements like pools, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would need the ability to set the &quot;surface level&quot; within the symbol, and then a check box to &quot;allow conformation to planar slope&quot; For instance a pool would always want to be level, and likely embedded in the surface model, while a bench could tilt slightly to conform to the pavement it sits on. !https://preview.redd.it/7a0vd615tffa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=06d2d3f6cb89a9ff99679c57f41ac89369f5f07f!

So far it looks like the state (enabled/disabled) is stored in the document. A possible solution could also be, that the states of the options from the document that is drawn in a full version will also influence how the model looks in the Viewer but in the Viewer there will be no possibility to enable or disable the options.

<br/>
The more I use Resilio the more superior I find it to all other sync services.<br/>
<br/>
It uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to securely transfers files machine-to-machine in an encrypted fashion, allowing us to employ asymmetric encryption that cannot be accessed by anybody. And files are not backed up to a central server, but are instead transferred peer-to-peer. <br/>
<br/>
It also allows files to be transferred locally across networks, limiting users only to their company&#39;s local network speed.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s no file storage limit.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks switched to this kind of architecture they could offer users the security benefits of such architecture (for those who really need it) and lower it&#39;s own server overheads.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of architecture does of course require that a device running a sync client must be on at all times to ensure the latest files are available to other devices. In this case Vectorworks users can choose to run their own storage device (providing a higher level of security and no additional subscription fees) or alternatively, VCS could provide this server in the cloud (with additional subscription fees depending on size of storage, and an acceptance a slightly lower security), with the added benefit of being able to process the files and provide rendering services etc.<br/>
<br/>
Or, on this very last point about processing/rendering, is this is where things could come unstuck?

<br/>
I think the Clip-Cube need some improvements.<br/>
<br/>
My personal wish-list:<br/>
<br/>
— better snapping-behaviour to other objects<br/>
   snapping often feels a bit clunky<br/>
  See video attached: I can&#39;t snap to the cube in the foreground!<br/>
  The cube in the background is snapable!<br/>
  It depends on where you start with the mouse!<br/>
  If you start on the left side of the clip cube, you couldn&#39;t snap to the<br/>
  right cube, if you start on the right side of the clip cube, you could snap<br/>
  on both cubes.<br/>
  The x-ray-mode in combination with clip-cube would not help for a better<br/>
  snappin-behaviour! It would be nice to see improvements with this!<br/>
<br/>
— option (on/off) to not combine all cutted objects to one clip-cube-surface,<br/>
   all edged-lines of all cutted objects should be visible + snapable.<br/>
<br/>
– option (on/off) to show hatches of objects (walls, slabs, 3D objects, …)<br/>

If a user has set that a BackUp should be created after-x-minutes (without asking), then this should also happen if he has e.g. the dialog of the Data Manager open. Especially in the Data Manager it can happen, that a user works for 30 oder 45minutes.

                                            <td class="description">      It is proposed Energos export data to the proprietary .ppp file format for ready import to the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) calculator. <br/>
<br/>
Presently we find most Vectorworks users working with the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) will export their Vectorworks model to Collada, then import to SketchUp, then use the SketchUp plug-in DesignPH, then export the results to the special .ppp file format, then finally import this file into the PHPP spreadsheet.<br/>
<br/>
The workflow is cumbersome and one direction, but users fall back on it because it is a documented and reliable method.<br/>
<br/>
Given Energos is a fantastic dynamic way to assess the energy performance of a design and provide real time feedback on design decisions (eg; orientation) that have critical ramifications on energy load (and ultimately Passive House compliance), it is unfortunate the information flow becomes discontinuous. Once the model is passed to other software, the shear inconvenience of the method all but extinguishes the opportunity for nimble design decisions. Furthermore, it goes without saying that the lack of a more direct pathway diverts our users away from Vectorworks and promotes our competitors.<br/>
<br/>
There is an increasing desire among users to expedite this process. It should also be noted that for testing purposes it would be extremely useful to get apples for apples results between Energos and PHPP (which is currently extremely elusive). <br/>
<br/>
The SketchUp plug-in DesignPH exported .ppp file appears to be a specially formatted text file with specific values formatted appropriately and found in locations expected for ready import into the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP).<br/>
<br/>
Passive House commented that the PPP file is a proprietary format for PHPP originally developed for internal use but may be available for connecting to external tools. <br/>
<br/>
Energos currently exports a .csv file of many of the values required by PHPP. A preliminary investigation shows many of these values may be manually passed to the PHPP spreadsheet. The process is tedious, confusing and error prone. Furthermore, there are many values that are simply in the wrong format (eg; True/False).<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to the attached &#39;ANZ Mock-up PHPP_EN_V10.3_i.xlsx&#39; and accompanying &#39;ANZ MockUp v2023.vwx&#39;<br/>
<br/>
In the .xlsx file you will observe the first worksheet has been added by the author and contains the imported Energos .csv values. A sample of values has been mapped to the likely input fields in the PHPP worksheets. This exercise serves as proof of concept only.<br/>
<br/>
As a means to improve the conduit between Vectorworks and PHPP, perhaps Energos could directly export a .ppp file.

<br/>
BIM methodology when compared to how we used to tag doors, dictates that when something is deleted, it&#39;s gone from the file so you can&#39;t record why the door number was retired or the door omitted, e.g. for Value Engineering, or simply because the design has changed.<br/>
<br/>
We never re-number a door once it&#39;s been deleted up until construction.  The door number remains in the file but the door is noted as &#39;omitted for VE&#39; or &#39;Demolished&#39; or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So there should be a way to retire a door via a &#39;phase&#39; that removes it from the wall, but leaves it in the schedule and note it&#39;s status somehow.<br/>
<br/>
The same applies to any BIM object that contributes to a schedule.<br/>
<br/>
One way to do this might be to allow the tag to remain, detached, but hidden via a class or phase.<br/>

I&#39;ve often found this frustrating, too. Is there any way to allow view changes while a modal dialog is open? Pan, Zoom, maybe even showing or hiding a layer or class or invoking a saved view. I&#39;ve often needed information that is &quot;off screen&quot; and have to exit, pan and re-invoke the command.<br/>
<br/>
This was also brought up with the home screen task, the fix there was to look at updating the home screen, but maybe altering the Modal Dialog could be more beneficial?

This would prevent manually created construction layers from not being exported to IFC. The disadvantage is that they may be assigned to the wrong floor. This could be optimized if the story is displayed in the Organization dialog and can be changed form the user (without using the export IFC dialog)

One one IFC storey exists despite there being three floors in the building = not compliant.<br/>

<br/>
I know some BIM softwares seem oblivious to the purpose of IFC storeys (e.g. Tekla) but given we are told to issue models with distinct floors in the BEP, this is quite important and we are losing out on some very useful functionality.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We could build the second model file using individual dlvps each placed on it&#39;s own layer, etc, but that is quite time-consuming, particularly when there are multiple buildings involved.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, we need the ifc storeys defined in the source model to map through the second model so that on export the storeys export correctly.

The renumber tool does not know how to do this, and includes doors that are not in the corridor.<br/>
<br/>
Without having to jump through hoops to turn off doors we do not want to tag, whilst at the same time take advantage of the &#39;tag all doors&#39; option in the data tag tool, it would be great if we could select the tool to renmeber the doors and then click on the doors in sequence and link them via a virtual polygon that gives a visual of the process and the selection and allows it to be edited and whilst selecting the doors allows you to go back one step using the delete key, like a polygon.

It is not supposed to be possible to calculate gross and net surface area from curtain walls in a worksheet. (this bug report was about how it went wrong, the conclusion was that it is not supposed to function at all)<br/>
For rough estimations it can be very helpful to be able to calculate surface area from curtain walls.

In the referenced thread the original poster is trying to identify some walls to exclude from a schedule. The best recommendation to date is to attach a record and use that as the identifier.<br/>

But Walls already have Wall Data and Energos information attached, but that data can not be used as a criteria.

<br/>
It would be nice to be able to have a &quot;startup&quot; script that could run once and provide the setup necessary for the worksheet script in the database row. Similarly, If I need to store some temporary information while the script runs that does not need to be permanent, it would be nice to be able to has set &quot;shutdown&quot; script that would run after all the other database row script executions.<br/>
<br/>
I can sort of simulate this now by using scripts in other cells, but that makes it very difficult on the end user. <br/>
<br/>
If the script could determine which database subrow it is in (in calculation order) then it could run that part of the code when it is executing on line 1 and then run another section of code when it is running on the last database row. This would require a Boolean function (or an Object Variable) letting the script check if it is the first or last cell in the database to be calculated.<br/>
<br/>
Alternately, a version of RunScript that would allow you to name three scripts, main, startup, shutdown, with startup running once, then main for every cell in the database, then shutdown after the last cell has calculated.<br/>
<br/>
The current use case is comparing objects to Space objects to determine if they are located in the boundaries of the Space or not. The time to run the script is linear regarding the number of objects, but logarithmic regarding the number of spaces. If I could pre-process the spaces to exclude items where there is no chance of a match, I could greatly reduce the run time of the script. But trying to do that pre-processing on each iteration of the script takes almost as long as just running the comparison of every object.

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
The rendering of transparent 3D-objects in Vectorworks<br/>
is currently not well solved!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some thoughts on this.<br/>
Please see attached VW 2023 document with more information<br/>
+ a small video from Sketchup to see what&#39;s possible there.<br/>
<br/>
Sketchup is way more flexible in rendering!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
Shaded View could be enhanced with more useful options like:<br/>
 * Transparency + settings 0–100%<br/>
 * Show Hidden Line + settings for: line-style, line-thickness, …<br/>
 * Profile Lines<br/>
 * End Points<br/>
<br/>
If you enhance “Shaded”, maybe we don&#39;t need the other Rendering Modes<br/>
like “Hidden Line”, &quot;Dashed Hidden Line&quot; …<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
All 3D and PIO won&#39;t get transparent if you change<br/>
the Opacity of a design-layer!<br/>
<br/>
… only 2D objects gets affected!<br/>
<br/>
Please also for 3D objects and PIO!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.<br/>
Image Effects have no option for Opacity!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
If you set a Design Layer to “Gray” you do<br/>
not have any settings how transparent the objects<br/>
will get.<br/>
<br/>
We need setup for this!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope we see an enhanced Rendering for Shades View in the future.<br/>
Best would be to have flexible options like in Sketchup to do our own setup.<br/>
<br/>

When the Space has its &quot;Show 2D Boundary&quot; option OFF then we have added a 2D Locus to help but that&#39;s not enough.<br/>
When we designed the Space label to Data Tag task (T02240) we missed that the Space label was the thing users were clicking on to select the Space. So now they still click on the label, selecting the Data Tag. Then they move to the OIP in order to change some Space settings just to realize it&#39;s a Data Tag object. Having here a button to select the Space would save them from some frustration.<br/>

Another option could be to have a command in the context menu of the Data Tag like &quot;Select linked object&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
This applies to most resource actions available in contextual menus. The file has to be Active for anything to work.<br/>
<br/>
It would be much handier if you could simply right click the name of the open file directly in the RM and have the option to &quot;Activate in Drawing Window,&quot; which would do the same thing as clicking the appropriate file tab above the View Bar.<br/>
<br/>
This would allow you to stay in the Resource Manager and focus on managing your resources, without having to navigate away to switch between documents.<br/>

This was originally posted in the Wishlist forum where Holister Design Studio wrote: &quot;It would be nice to be able to right click on the drawing name in the &#39;Open Files&#39; area of the resource manager to make it active. When I have two or three drawings open and with two screens (and the RM on the second monitor), it&#39;s a LONG way to go all the way to the tabs on the left hand side of the main screen. And from what I gather, you can&#39;t do much in the RM without the file being the active file.&quot;

<br/>
I encounter this shortcoming frequently, daily, hourly, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks has become a great product for working in 3D. Coupled with Zoom and Teams, we have 3D design sessions with clients and colleagues on a regular basis. The results are impressive. Clients, Engineers, Contractors, Architects love it and always ask &quot;What program is that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, one of the most annoying limitations to working in 3D is not being able to tell which end of the wall is the beginning and which is the end. I can&#39;t tell in a 3D view and neither can you. The OIP doesn&#39;t help. <br/>
<br/>
It is important to know which side is which. If I change a texture on one side, in 3D with the client watching, believe me, I want to know which side is which. When I want to render the start or end of a wall, I want to know which end is which.<br/>
When I want to fit a wall to objects, I have to know which side is which because I may want to fit to the right side or the left side of the wall and I can&#39;t do that confidently, in 3D if I don&#39;t know which side is which.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the 3D workflow is interrupted by the need to switch to a 2D plan to see which end of the wall is the starting end. Once I know this, I can go back to the 3D view and make the change. Heaven help me if I need to do this to a number of walls, such as happens when fitting to objects. I just won&#39;t remember and will need to take a sceenshot or keep referring back to 2D. Very annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs an indicator that shows the start, end, left, right, it doesn&#39;t matter just some indicator, visible in 3D. Maybe it&#39;s as simple as adding  &quot;L&quot; or &quot;R&quot; beside the schematic in the OIP. Maybe in the rendering pane selecting the &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;side causes that side to highlight or maybe the blue arrow and square appear at the ends of the wall, as happens now in 2D.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to this being implemented. It will simplify and enhance the 3D workflow.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently to tag coincident objects you need to have the &quot;back&quot; object selected to be able to tag it.<br/>
<br/>
One way to do this is to switch to the Selection tool and then back to the Data Tag tool.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively you can use the Boomerang mode, but this is a lot of steps:<br/>
<br/>
Space to activate Boomerang with the Pan tool<br/>
<br/>
X to switch to the Selection Tool<br/>
<br/>
J to activate Coincident Object Selection.<br/>
<br/>
Click to select the object<br/>
<br/>
Choose from the Coincident Selection dialog box<br/>
<br/>
Tag the object.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It would be better to add a coincident mode directly into the Data Tag (and probably other tools as well) where is the J key is held down while associating the Data Tag the Coincident Selection dialog box would open and allow the selection of the object to tag.

we do wish a message plopping up, when customer activates option &quot;Use wall closure&quot; e.g. in Plug-in Objects Options dialog window.<br/>
Especially with our german windows the insertion location is not correct afterwards.<br/>
When using walls closure the insertion option must not be Wall - Centerline any more, but need to have in 99% of all cases be Wall Closure - Insertion Location.<br/>
Best solution would be that the insert location would automatically switch. But that is not always wanted.<br/>
So we wish a message dialog window telling the customer to take care of insert location.<br/>
See my video. I demonstrated it with a german version of Vectorworks.<br/>
Guess there is no need to send a testfile because the wish is for a message dialog window.<br/>

VW could use an enhancement for placing objects in the Z direction.<br/>
<br/>
We can use the &quot;send to surface&quot; command that will bring an object to the surface of a DTM-site model.<br/>
We need the same type of ability to accurately send objects in the Z direction to another object. In the attached movie, it is difficult to send a light object up to the ceiling. It is a sloped ceiling, so its Z height varies. Still I want to send the light up to it.<br/>
The desired behavior might be like this:<br/>
1) Chose an object or objects and then;<br/>
2) Chose a target surface (or working plane);<br/>
3) Run the command that will lift or lower the objects until they each reach the desired surface. Each object should independently stop at the surface because the height to the target object may be different for each one.<br/>
<br/>
I think this could easily be a function within VW. There are examples of tools that do this. For instance  &quot;Send to Surface&quot; and the &quot;Project&quot; 3D modelling tool.<br/>
<br/>
One workaround for this now is :<br/>
1) Set a working plane that will be the target surface;<br/>
2) Draw a 2D object on the subject object (the one that should move);<br/>
3) The 2D object will actually be drawn on the working plane.<br/>
At this point, I would want to align the 2D Planar object and the object to be moved, using the Align/Distribute 3D tool. Alas, this tool does not work with Planar Objects.<br/>
4) Therefore, convert the 2D object to 3D object or snap a 3D locus onto the planar object;<br/>
5) With both objects selected, run 3D align/Distribute command;<br/>
6) The subject object will move to the working plane.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a complex workflow but it works. It would be much better to have a tool that does this.<br/>
<br/>
See the attached video. The light is black and the roof surface is sloped. <br/>
BTW, I know, in this case, I can easily go to a side view and manually move the light up until it hits the ceiling, Sometimes it is very hard to do this without taking an inordinate amount of time.

 # The dialog box that comes up appears very crowded. There is lots of space for the frame and buttons, but the text box area is very small and the text &quot;feels&quot; crowded. There should not be a vertical scroll bar until there are at least 4-6 items. The dialog box is small enough that it does not need them. !image-2023-02-06-08-49-28-820.png!<br/>
 # If you use the J key shortcut to allow left click coincident selection, the dialog box trys to take that key press as data entry and finds it &quot;illegal&quot; and starts beeping until you release the J key. I almost always end up with at least 3-4 beeps every time I use the J key to active coincident selection. This is very annoying. The dialog box needs to ignore the J key (and the space bar if used from boomerang mode) and not look for Key Down, but rather wait for a new Key Press.

So it would be better if Spell Check &#39;navigated&#39; to the Text Object in the drawing window (i.e. in the background behind Spell Check). It could either do it automatically, or be a &quot;Find&quot; button that a user manually clicks in order to navigate the background view to the Text object (sort of like using the &quot;Find-Replace Text&quot; command but without having to leave Spell Check).

the wish is, to be able to color referenced viewports on design layer in different colors.<br/>
Customers using lots of ref. DLVP want to be able to see them quickly for analysis.<br/>
The first thing that came to my mind was data visualization.<br/>
But that is not possible with ref. viewports.<br/>
It must not necessarily be data visualization. At least to color each ref. viewport would be helpful.<br/>
Workaround for the customer is to use ref. design layers instead of ref. viewport. Then customer can color ref. layer. But that is only a workaround. Better to color ref. DLVP.<br/>

<br/>
When I have a worksheet with database rows, and the &quot;Summarize Items&quot; checkbox is selected in one of the database columns, there can be multiple items reported on one worksheet row. If I right-click on any of these rows I am presented with two menus 1) &quot;Select Item&quot;, and 2) &quot;Row Height...&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Choosing the &quot;Select Item&quot; menu only selects ONE item in the drawing. I would like the option to be able to select ALL items represented in that row.<br/>
<br/>
Please add another right-click menu option &quot;Select Items&quot; (plural), such that all items represented in a summarized row get selected.<br/>
<br/>
If you desire an example file to demonstrate the behavior, please ask and I will upload one. Thank you.

Parking space should consider the car length in case the spaces are angled. In that case a car would be partially on the street.<br/>
Wish an additional option to consider the car length.<br/>
At the moment customer has to calculate the appropriate space length himself.<br/>

With T02348 (Door and Window Interactive Sizing Improvements) the new feature will get more improvements in VW2024.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, it would be great if the new Control Points would be supported be the *Reshape Tool* as well.<br/>
<br/>
The advantages would be:<br/>
 * *Multi-Editing of several windows and doors with the Marquee Mode of the Reshape Tool-&gt;* Example see movie in the attachment<br/>
 * *Consistency -&gt;* Other complex objects like Stairs, Walls, Spaces etc. can already be reshaped by the Reshape Tool.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As seen in the movie, there might be also a bug:<br/>
<br/>
When I used the Marquee Mode only on a part of a window, the whole window moved. It shouldn&#39;t move at all or even better: By implementing this VE only one side of the window should be moved and the width should be extended.

This would also affect the amount of cells actually being exported, because the cells that would normally be required to produce the results would not be needed any more. So, in case &quot;all selected rows&quot; would be chosen, then really only those would be exported.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
Currently exporting the selection shown in Fig. 1, will result in Excel looking like Fig. 2. Mind you, there is currently a bug that causes Vectorworks to export certain formulas incorrectly (see: VB-192593)<br/>
<br/>
After the wish implementation the result in Excel would look like Fig. 3 instead.

Currently, the search function uses a straight partial-string search.

<br/>
Additionally, the search box could allow partial-command autofill. For example, typing, &quot;conv,&quot; would suggest &quot;Convert&quot; in the search box, which the user could accept with a keystroke (usually tab or enter), and then &quot;g&quot; would suggest Convert to Group.

when you select a color using Other Palettes, then the next time you want to select a color the colors from Active Document are displayed and not the previously selected palette.<br/>

I know you can make this palette active in Manager Palette.<br/>

Most of our bigger customers have dozens of worksheets with dozens or hundreds of cells. Therefore a way to select which Worksheets (or Record Fields for that matter) to look for the string would be very beneficial for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) You may not want to replace a certain word in certain places.<br/>
2) Doing this operation on very few selected places speeds up the whole process significantly - especially for those mentioned customers.

I think this is not really user friendly. If you could customize this it would be a big help. The problem is with the bounding box when stamping sloping beams in supplements in a viewport. maybe you can also rotate the bounding box there. In the design layer it works. You can see it in the video. I know the video is german but I think you understand my wish.<br/>

a wish about title block.<br/>
Current situation is that you can insert and place a north point and a drawing stamp. The position of these two elements are fix. This means, when you change the page size, e.g. customer adds one viewport after the other and then the page gets too small to contain them all, then the title block symbol adjust itself to the new page. But the north point and the drawing stamp keep their fix position. The result is, that the customer has to move both elements manually.<br/>
Wish is an option so these two elements do adjust themselves relativ to the title block symbol.<br/>
See video.<br/>
(Sorry, automatically correction does not know the word north and replaced by not or note.)

The reason for this is that it is very difficult to create a large number of accounts at the time of product introduction, depending on the usage status of the user.<br/>
Since the Site Protection software is a floating license, there may be more users than the holding number of licenses.<br/>

<br/>
Notice the layer and class options show the usual Active only, Gray others, Gray Snap Others, ... Show Snap Modify Others settings. <br/>
When run, the Saved View will be instructed to apply one of these options. See the attached image.<br/>
Frequently, it is not desirable to change the layer and class option from what is currently being used but we are forced to chose one.  Sometimes I want to run a Saved View but do not want to change the Layer and Class options.<br/>
 <br/>
There is no way to do this. <br/>
<br/>
A &quot;Don&#39;t Save&quot; setting is required.<br/>
<br/>
There is a &quot;Don&#39;t Save&quot; setting available for Active Class and Active Layer. See the attached image. We need that for Class and Layer Options too.<br/>
<br/>
Turning off Restore Layer Visibility or Restore Class Visibility will deactivate the layer and class options as desired. However, if you turn off &quot;restore layer or class visibility&quot; all class and layer control is lost and you are back to using the  navigation pallet to control the classes and layers. To see this, turn off all the classes in a drawing and then run a saved view that has &quot;restore layer or class visibility&quot; turned off. Even though you may have set up the saved view with specific layer and class visibilities, all of that is lost. This type of saved view has little purpose. See the attached image.<br/>
<br/>
What we need is a &quot;Don&#39;t Save&quot; setting for the layer and class options, in addition to Active Only, Gray Others... Show Snap Modify others.<br/>
This would give us the ability to recall the layer and class visibilities while not being forced into a specific layer or class option (see below)<br/>
<br/>
In short, Layer and Class options need to be given a &quot;Don&#39;t Save&quot; setting.

 * Reveal in Finder/Explorer<br/>
 * Remove from recents<br/>

These are common commands in other applications that have such a recent files view/list and it would be great to add this functionality to our Home Screen.<br/>
<br/>
Adding these two commands will improve the user&#39;s experience of working with their files in conjunction with Vectorworks. Often it is necessary to go to _other_ files that are near a Vectorworks file and the Reveal command would facilitate this action. Also, sometimes it is necessary to open a Vectorworks file to briefly check something within it. Currently when a user does this, the file appears in the recent list when it may not need to be accessed again soon – the &quot;Remove&quot; command would help keep the user&#39;s recent file list most useful to them.<br/>
<br/>
An added bonus, though less essential than the functions listed above, would be the following:<br/>
 * Pin to start of grid/list (along with an associated icon that would appear with the file to indicate its pinned status)<br/>

As you can see in the video, you need to make a specific class for the 2D boundary in order to be able to unlink the fill and line (and text) opacity. This is a too strict workflow for most users. It would be easier if you could just manage the fill and line opacity separately in the attributes palette and Space graphics settings.

                Worksheet Function to access Database Header Row Value

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The database header row typically displays the SUM of the values in that column, but there is not way to access that value to use it in further calculations directly. Any use of that cell value in the database is assumed to reference the value in the subrow. Due to a bug (VB-191196), you can not just use a non-database cell as a placeholder, you need to use a spreadsheet cell function with the full criteria to return the same value as is shown in the database header row.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good to have a worksheet function that would return the value of a database header row rather than the subrow value. This could be a repurposing of the SUM function.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Example:  You have a database in Row 3 and you want to display the  Area of each object and the percentage of the total area.<br/>
<br/>
The formulas then look something like the:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A3. =Area()<br/>
<br/>
B3. =A3/HeaderRowValue(A3)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If VB-191196 is fixed the work around would be:<br/>
<br/>
A3. =Area()<br/>
<br/>
A1. =B3<br/>
<br/>
B3. =A3/B1<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The current work around is:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A3. =Area()<br/>
<br/>
A1. =Area(((Same criteria as database row))<br/>
<br/>
B3=A3/A1<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can not use a formula like:  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
B3.  A3/Area(((Same criteria as database row))<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
because it returns a #OPCODE error from trying to use criteria in a function in a database header row that is already using the database criteria.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Being able to directly reference the SUMmed value in the database header row will make some calculations much easier<br/>

If it doesn&#39;t do this is there a way to add this to the new task?<br/>

EJKerr:<br/>
It seems like you would want to have a line break as part of the separator for the dynamic text.  It won&#39;t let you enter that right now.

Users find this very counterintuitive, as some objects are specified, and others are not. For example, you can&#39;t search for a style object such as &#39;Plant&#39; - you&#39;ll get all pots and planters included. You can do this for walls, as you have this option in the dropdown at the top.<br/>
<br/>
I understand it can&#39;t be easy to cater for all style objects for all industries, but it would help if you could select to look at more specific objects, such as Plants, Landscape areas, Hardscape, etc., in the top dropdown menu.

At concerts and events, there are cases where projection mapping is performed on the floor, but the projector cannot be placed in the center of the screen, so it is difficult to express it.

I assume this is because the GL is choosing a particular beam in the drawing to be the representative image and it happens to be turned 90˚. I propose another Display type, Member Profile Display, which will display the profile shape of structural members no matter their structural use (beams or columns) or their direction in the drawing.

In fact, it is only the last two commands in the &quot;3D Power pack&quot; sub-menu that mention NURBS at all.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2023-01-12-10-28-53-787.png|width=674,height=437!<br/>
<br/>
The result is that these (extremely cool and useful) NURBS capabilities are so hidden that most people don&#39;t find them or if they do see them, it takes too much reading of command names to even know they relate to NURBS (And do they all relate to NURBS? Even that isn&#39;t clear to the uninitiated.) In training and demos that I have done for people, users and prospects have found the term &quot;3D Power Pack&quot; unhelpful or ambiguous.<br/>
<br/>
In order to increase our credibility in the NURBS modeling arena and to help users find our NURBS commands, I propose that we change the name from &quot;3D Power Pack to &quot;NURBS Operations&quot;. Changing the name will bring NURBS greater visibility in all of our default workspaces and in turn more use.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the command &quot;Update layer from feature services&quot;  does not work as desired. The same goes for the one you propose in &quot;Arcgis &quot; box.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I made a ticket about 1 year ago concerning this problem.  ( Jira ticket &quot; https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-186193 &quot;) I didn&#39;t get a satisfactory feedback, although this ticket was classified by you as &quot;solved&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the case since customers are facing the same problem in the 2023 version and I am sorry that I cannot offer them a quick and satisfactory help.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, you had underlined that this problem is the consequence of the impossibility to download &quot;{_}certain and more accurate data.{_}&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it is at my level or that of my colleagues  ( Jira Ticket &quot; https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-190139 &quot;  , Request  &quot; https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-103516 &quot;) and, above all, of the customers, it is difficult for us to understand this problem from this angle, since it does not occur on &quot;Qgis&quot; or &quot; Global mapper&quot; ; this is all the more true since in the presentation of &quot;GIS&quot; 2022, it was underlined that one can download data such as sidewalks, for example, even if it was necessary to go through &quot;Arcgis&quot; box. <br/>
<br/>
It would then be more efficient, in my opinion, to have the same results through the WFS URLs, since the data finally exists.<br/>
<br/>
I will insist on the resolution of this request, because it must be emphasized that it is a &quot;Must&quot; for a software that we propose to landscape and urban planner customers. <br/>
Otherwise, we encounter difficulties in prospecting the landscape market, nor that of the large national agencies, since it is their first concern raised during the demonstrations.<br/>
<br/>
I understand perfectly the stakes in the development of this command. But, this request comes from a desire to be able to demonstrate to customers that Vectorworks is the &quot;Must&quot; that a Landscape and Urbanism professional should look for to improve his performance. Also, if we want Vectorworks to be a tool apart from the other software &quot;QGIS, Global mapper&quot; etc.... It must have basic functionalities such as unlimited downloading of data or raster images via the the functionalities  startindex and the Bbox,  and also to be able to download the desired details according to the scale that the user works.<br/>

<br/>
It is expected for users to use data visualization to query undefined IFC data fields. <br/>
For example, it is currently not possible to query an IFC entry (Boolean) that is initially assigned the value &quot;undefined&quot; via the data visualization and has exactly these objects (e.g., door) colored. <br/>
The attached example file clearly shows an object with the IFC PSet information SelfClosing, in all three states. The control value &quot;undefined&quot; is essential for the user to make adjustments here if necessary. Unfortunately, this is currently not possible. <br/>
Everything works as desired and expected if the value is queried via the object data. <br/>

                                            <td class="description">      I have been making a number of animations for the video team lately. I have been finding that while it is easy to create a path, modify a path, and aim keyframes of that animation path, the resulting video aways seems to have a &quot;robotic jerkiness&quot; to it no matter how I try to keep my path smooth and my key framing aiming consistent and smooth.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the animation is simply doing what I have instructed it to do, but it would be great if the transitions could be smoother when the keyframe angle, tilt, etc changes. The best way I can think of describing this is to implement the kind of optical stabilization that a steadicam achieves.<br/>
<br/>
One of the customer files I&#39;ve been using is attached to show what I&#39;m referring to (though this request is not specific to this particular file.) I recommend viewing the animation of path 3. (Note that I&#39;ve placed each animation&#39;s path on its own class to keep things sorted.) I&#39;ve also attached the video created from animation path 3.<br/>
<br/>
As you will see, when you play animation path 3 via its OIP&#39;s Play button, the keyframe aiming is (I&#39;d say) pretty good. It seems fairly smooth. Certainly smoother than the resulting video created from it. I tried several times to make the smoothest keyframe view changes and this was as close as I could get, but the resulting video still looks too &quot;robotic&quot; by cinematic standards.<br/>
<br/>
My hope and enhancement request is to add smoother camera movement or a steadicam-like effect to animations to reduce or eliminate the &quot;robotic&quot; feeling movement of the view.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

But those buttons are sort of hidden in the middle of the screen and I often (75% of the time) forget to hit them the first time I edit a data tag.<br/>
<br/>
I think the box layout could be improved by moving the Add and Replace buttons to somewhere more noticeable. Possibly to the bottom either between the Cancel and OK buttons on on a row just above them. In either location you eye would be drawn to them when you are looking for the OK button to exit the dialog box.<br/>

As it is now, I can insert my lighting device and I can specify 3D rotation params for it, but no matter how I rotate it in 3D, the top/plan view remains the same. This can lead to confusing results in all sorts of workflows. A very simple example is that I insert a striplight and then give it a Y rotation of 90. Now, it&#39;s vertically-oriented in 3D. But when I look at it in top-plan, I still see the same horizontal view of it, which makes no sense and doesn&#39;t fit properly in the 2D plan of my light plot. Imagine if I could just go to the object info palette and change &quot;Use 2D Component&quot; from &quot;Top&quot; to &quot;Right&quot; and now the top/plan view is perfect! What a dream!<br/>
<br/>
This can also be especially annoying when it comes to working with schematic views. <br/>
<br/>
Now that our lighting symbols can have many 2D components, please let us select a different one other than &quot;Top&quot; to be displayed by Spotlight in Top/Plan view. It&#39;s important that this property be available for normal lighting devices and for lighting devices viewed via a Schematic View (so I can adjust the light&#39;s 2D component independent of the position&#39;s 2D component. <br/>

The list of saved views can get quite long in a file. Navigating this without the option to group views together into folders, or without a hierarchy, is quite tedious. The filter method only partially solves the issue, but is no replacement for grouping / hierarchy.

                                            <td class="description">      The paperless office corresponds to the desire for digitization, depending on the industry or size of a project easier or more difficult to implement. For simple projects, however, not much is missing and we could create a great added value from the existing tools. The basic idea is that you no longer have to create a layout to show details but that from viewing the 3D model can eliminate uncertainty, but also no big additional effort for the preparation of the 3D model should be needed. From this the following wishes can be derived:<br/>
 # Labeling objects like Data Tags, Dimensions and Texts should be visible in the 3D model. These should also be able to be displayed when the textures of the objects are set to gray. Here also a simple control to switch them on or off would be useful. (something like: Show Labels, Show Dimensions). See Label and Dimensions.png. For simplicity&#39;s sake, all objects that are drawn with the tools in the Dims/Notes tool set could be useful in the 3D model too...<br/>
 # Representation grey in the 3D model should optionally be shown with edges for better readability<br/>
 # Grey representation in the 3D model where objects touch each other, this should be optionally, visually highlighted<br/>
 # Exploded View: The model should be able to be pulled apart in the individual axes in the same way as an exploded view. This is especially interesting for furniture drawings.<br/>
 # The transparency of the representation grey of a layer should be controllable.<br/>

Using DoMenuTextByName(&#39;Standard Palettes Chunk&#39;, X); you can toggle the visibility of the Attributes (X=1), Working Planes (X=2), and Resource Manager (X=3) palettes, but that does not offer the control being requested. <br/>

I would like to be able to GET and SET the visibility of any palette through scripting control. The VS commands GetPaletteVisibility() and SetPaletteVisibility() perform the desired functionality, but only on User Defined palettes.

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Attached, you find a screencast from Sketchup.<br/>
<br/>
I show a feature/function which is really helpful to check your drawing<br/>
accuracy relative to the current active axis.<br/>
<br/>
In Sketchup, you can temporarily overwrite the colors of all lines<br/>
with the color of the current axis.<br/>
<br/>
The lines get the color only, if they orientate 100%<br/>
in the direction of the axis.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your drawings really fast with this feature.<br/>
This is also be very helpful with DWG/DXF imports with<br/>
a lot of lines, polygons, … <br/>
<br/>
I used this feature/function very often in Sketchup. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lines in x-axis-direction will be overwritten with red<br/>
Lines in y-axis-direction will be overwritten with green<br/>
Lines in z-axis-direction will be overwritten with blue<br/>
<br/>
/ / / <br/>
<br/>
I have tried to replicate this with data visualization,<br/>
but this cannot currently be achieved with data visualization.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, with Data Vis, you can achieve a color<br/>
overwrite only for 2D lines and only for x and y.<br/>
No other geometry (Nurbs, polygons, …) will be affected<br/>
and no color for any Z-direction. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
So one solution could be, to enhance Data Visualization,<br/>
but it would like to see this function as option (icon) in the Mode Bar<br/>
(or is it called Option Bar) on the top right side, to easy and fast turn it<br/>
on or off.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently, we don&#39;t have any options to check your drawings,<br/>
in this way. I would find this very, very useful.<br/>
<br/>

By adding a &quot;width&quot; parameter in the local mapping pop over, this could be done way more intuitively.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if the &quot;width&quot; and &quot;length&quot; parameters could be unlinked, it would be possible to scale a complex line type only in one dimension. See the attached video for an example where this could be useful.<br/>

<br/>
in some software I use, it is possible to activate “Center Mode&quot; temporary <br/>
by pressing Option (Mac) or ALT (Win).<br/>
<br/>
We do have temporary modes in VW …<br/>
<br/>
Rectangle Tool (with Mac)<br/>
SHIFT = square<br/>
SHIFT + CMD = rectangle with &quot;Golden Ratio&quot;<br/>
<br/>
… but there is room for more.<br/>
<br/>
The OPTION or ALT key cannot be used, while the user is in drawing mode<br/>
with Rectangle or Line Tool.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest: “Center Mode” for an extra mode.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
Rectangle and Lines<br/>
Both tools have an extra but permanent &quot;Center Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This solution is okay, but not so “drawing-friendly” as a temporary mode<br/>
with OPTION or ALT, because a temporary mode is way faster, specially<br/>
for the Rectangle Tool.<br/>
<br/>
… AND you always have to press the same key to activate a &quot;Center Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rectangle: method change to &quot;Center Mode&quot; = U key<br/>
Line: method change to &quot;Center Mode&quot; = I key<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Maybe other tools could benefit from OPTION or ALT too.<br/>

Tabs should only shrink and truncate the filename if they absolutely have to because there are too many tabs open to fit them all with full filenames on the screen.<br/>

And in the less common case when they do have to be truncated like this, I should be able to get on OnHover tooltip of the full filename if I have on the tab.<br/>

<br/>
_Good morning,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d like to submit a feature request to Vectorworks, or seek a solution if this is something already possible in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
When placing callouts in the sheet layers, viewport annotations it&#39;s possible to use a user-defined font formatting style. When this is placed as a keynote, options for setting the fonts isn&#39;t available which means every keynote needs to be formatted individually between new projects. <br/>
<br/>
Our initial workaround for this is to copy and paste the formatted keynote between sheets, but this isn&#39;t an ideal way of working as it&#39;s not built in to the template we&#39;ve developed in the office.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as projects develop and we change the drawings/viewport scales from 1:100 to 1:25, the annotation styles don&#39;t scale. It would be good if we were able to set this to automatically scale, or have an option to quickly update fonts to a larger scale to suit the drawing scales._<br/>
<br/>
Is this something already available in Vectorworks?

Basically: I think confusion arises around what &quot;structural objects&quot; are, as defined for the purpose of section viewports and the various options in the &quot;Advanced Section Properties&quot; dialogue. But this wishlist item goes a little further I think. I am going to try and keep this concise to start with, partly to stop it being too confusing, partly because I&#39;m running out of time to write this just now.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s that dialogue box:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have attached a VWX file with this post. It&#39;ll probably be necessary to open it and look at it in order for this post to make any sense. Screenshots are taken from it. The array of possible section viewports looks like this:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each of those section viewports is a section through this hypothetical wall/roof buildup:<br/>
<br/>
[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1693255_Screenshot2022-12-19at22_57_01.jpg.3a8ef94298c0d98c9f65bec081a6c69a.jpg|width=896!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1693255_Screenshot2022-12-19at22_57_01.jpg.3a8ef94298c0d98c9f65bec081a6c69a.jpg]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a standard cavity wall here in the UK, brick outer skin (not loadbearing), insulation in cavity, block inner skin (loadbearing). I&#39;ve modelled a kind of decorative brickwork corbel at the top of the brick. The roof is structural timber joists, plywood deck on top, insulation &amp; membrane above. Plasterboard ceiling fixed to bottom of joists. Decorative coving at junction of wall and roof, internally. What I&#39;ve drawn is just illustrative for the purposes of this wishlist post.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Most of my section drawings (in practice) are either<br/>
<br/>
- something like *section type B* where I want to show some level of internal buildup detail, and where the scale is 1:50 or larger. In these examples I&#39;ve shown material fills as solid colour, but in reality I would usually be using hatches instead.<br/>
<br/>
- something like *section type E* where I don&#39;t want to show buildup detail. Anything smaller than 1:50 will usually be like this. Sometimes I might use it up to 1:50 for early stage drawings.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Points to make:<br/>
<br/>
Note the difference between *section types A and B:*<br/>
<br/>
[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1497986009_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_05_45.jpg.9e98a5828ed576b8a84db058ead9e938.jpg|width=868!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1497986009_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_05_45.jpg.9e98a5828ed576b8a84db058ead9e938.jpg]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On *section type B* the brick corbel detail is &quot;merged&quot; with the brick component of the wall. I&#39;m more likely to want this, than the lines shown in *section type A.* I&#39;ve achieved this by telling VW that those extrudes I used to model the corbel courses are &quot;structural objects&quot; because this allows it to merge them with the &quot;structural object&quot; that is the wall. But of course, those corbels aren&#39;t in reality &quot;structural objects&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What are/aren&#39;t defined as &quot;structural objects&quot; for this purpose doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Either VW has got some wacky ideas about what&#39;s structural (ie holding the building up), or that&#39;s just a bad name for that type of object, or there needs to be some additional method(s) of choosing what to merge in sections.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Below, *section type F* on the left shows what VW thinks is and isn&#39;t structural. *Section type G* on the right shows what I think is and isn&#39;t structural.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then we come to what the &quot;profile line&quot; is. I actually haven&#39;t really used this in real life. I&#39;d assumed it was the outer profile of the whole section...but it seems it&#39;s not. A complication is that it doesn&#39;t seem to work in VW2023 SP2. So... here&#39;s a screenshot from VW2021 to show where it is drawn (as the red line) in *section type C :*<br/>
<br/>
[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1393518235_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_19_56.jpg.394ee6fe06b21cbaa720d284d3e8d95a.jpg|width=984!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1393518235_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_19_56.jpg.394ee6fe06b21cbaa720d284d3e8d95a.jpg]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But in *section type D* I indicate (by using stacked viewports) where I think a &quot;profile line&quot; should be and would be useful, and, I think, fits with a fairly standard drawing convention where the overall section cut line is drawn with a thick line (I&#39;ve just shown it in red for emphasis) and then the internal detail (also in section) is drawn with a thinner line:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m going to leave it at that for now, no doubt multiple subsidiary questions will come up in discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I do think the way that sections are drawn (and the amount of fine control given to the user) is really crucial in allowing us to create good, clear documentation from the model with as little touching-up in annotation space as possible.<br/>

This is great on Design Layers, but it&#39;s not super useful for Sheet Layers to always see &quot;Top/Plan&quot; for the View. Views aren&#39;t really a relevant thing when on Sheet Layers, but what&#39;s currently missing is the Sheet Name which WOULD be relevant and useful.<br/>

 * Top/Plan 01<br/>
 * Top/Plan 07<br/>

What would be MORE useful would be:<br/>

<br/>
Even BETTER would be:<br/>
 * 01 [Plan &amp; Elevations]<br/>
 * 07 [Desk Details]<br/>

because this matches how users &#39;think&#39; about sheets, and would also match the Syntax from the Layer dropdown.

Sometimes for a VP, one will add a new layer or class to satisfy a particular need but never are these additions tracked across the multiple Saved View scripts.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      As discussed here: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/103153-discussion-of-new-user-interface-preview-t02250-mode-bar-and-view-bar-redesign/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=451470]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consistency&quot; (and lack there-of) is one of the biggest complaints I hear about Vectorworks. A user expects similar results in similar contexts, but when actions yield _different_ results in similar contexts, it&#39;s aggravating, slows down the drawing process, and leads to errors.<br/>
<br/>
One inconsistency that currently exists is in regards to editing TEXT, wherein keyboard actions produce different results in various contexts. For example, when editing a Text object, you have to hit &quot;Esc&quot; to commit the text (since &quot;x&quot; obviously just types the character x), but hitting &quot;Esc&quot; _normally_ means to cancel the current operation, not commit it. This is confusing – I&#39;ve seen new users get tripped up on this, and it still trips me up after 15 years of using Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
And then other modifier keys lead to inconsistent results in other contexts. To illustrate what I&#39;m talking about, I made a chart of the &quot;current&quot; situation, outlining various contexts (rows) versus what happens when you hit certain keys (columns). Similar results are color-coded. Note how the colors in the top chart are patchy. On the bottom is a suggestion of reconfiguring things to be more consistent – note how the colors are blocked together, indicating consistency.<br/>
<br/>
!TextEditing.png|width=373,height=348!<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest changes I&#39;m suggesting is that hitting &quot;Enter&quot; should always commit the text (which addresses the issue I described earlier). Accordingly, that means a user will have to hit Shift+Enter to return to the next line. There are many websites and software these days that work like this (typing into iMessage on a Mac, to name one), so I&#39;m sure folks would quickly adapt to the change. This would also be a great opportunity to use contextual tooltips (like at the bottom of the screen) to nudge the user: &quot;Text Tool  *1*  Hit Enter to commit text. Hit Shift+Enter to go to next line. Hit Esc to cancel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A change like this would not only make text-based interactions more consistent, but it would also speed up users&#39; workflow. For example, when editing a Callout, a user can simply hit Enter when finished, instead of having to move the cursor to the OK button [since the Fn+Enter hotkey isn&#39;t common knowledge].<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This topic is particular relevant to experienced users who start to develop muscle memory, because as it stands that muscle memory delivers inconsistent results in situations that all feel like they should match. Every time I switch between the different contexts outlined above it pulls me out of my flow state, so I&#39;d love to see this given some thought for future versions. Thanks!

Something like a Menu option under the Vectorworks/Help Menus (mac/windows)<br/>

Or a button on the home screen that just looks for that file name in the user folder and opens the file in the default text editor? Or make the file an XML/HTML and open it in the default system web browser?

                Presentation Mode
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Sometimes we use Vectorworks to ‘present’ a design to someone, whether it be a colleague, boss, head designer, design team, a group on Zoom, etc. When presenting, we’re mainly just navigating our working file, pointing out things with the cursor, discussing elements, maybe selecting objects to see OIP properties, etc. But we’re not ‘working’ or doing any heavy editing. So the problem is that there’s potentially a lot of distracting gak on the screen that isn’t needed in a presentational context, and which sometimes pulls attention away from the focus of discussing the design. It’d be great to be able to quickly switch to a temporary “Presentation Mode” whenever you know you’re only going to be using Vectorworks in this simplified way while others are watching.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I suggest that under the Window menu there could be a new option to toggle “Presentation Mode” which would automatically turn on and off certain existing settings with one quick command. This would be customizable, so there would need to be a place to set up which settings you want to be affected. Under Presentation Mode Settings there would be checkboxes for the following:<br/>
<br/>
☐ Suppress all auto save pop-ups.<br/>
<br/>
☐ If using full-screen cursor, switch to simple pointer cursor.<br/>
<br/>
☐ Hide Light glyphs, green constraints, red unlinked indicators, loci, and other various glyphs.<br/>
<br/>
☐ Hide red viewport “out-of-date” borders.<br/>
<br/>
☐ Turn off snap indicators, smart cursor cues, acquisition hints, red smart points, etc.<br/>
<br/>
☐ Turn off pre-selection highlighting and other highlighting, keeping only selection highlighting. <br/>
<br/>
☐ Turn off &quot;Use Sound&quot;<br/>
<br/>
☐ Suspend snapping<br/>
<br/>
☐ Hide enabled palettes (that is, the setting that already exists in Window menu).<br/>
<br/>
☐ Disable Smart Options Display’s idle trigger.<br/>
<br/>
☐ Switch Floating Data Bar to be only show on Tab (if not already).<br/>
<br/>
☐ Deselect all objects across all Layers (for example, when you’re flipping through Sheet Layers there wouldn’t be viewports already highlighted from previous work.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Upon engaging Presentation mode, all of the checked items would be affected. Upon disengaging Presentation mode, settings would return to the same as they were before (I suppose with the exception of object selection state).<br/>
<br/>
When in Presentation mode, perhaps there’s a colored border around the screen to be clear that you’re in a special context, or maybe a bit of text in the status bar at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Presentation Mode is actually a Quick Pref button so you can quickly pop in and out of it (for example, perhaps in the middle of the presentation you need to do some real editing, so you toggle it off, make the change, then toggle it back on.)

There should be a choice offered to a user when saving stair settings whether to save it in the user folder or a workgroup folder.

<br/>
Currently, inserting a lighting device onto a hanging position hangs it in the downward ZERO Y rotation regardless of the roll setting of the hanging position. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, once a lighting device is attached to a hanging position, changing the roll value rotates the lighting position along its Y rotation axis.<br/>

For most Spotlight users this is far too slow and they will simply draw the structural member and then manually edit the Z height in the OIP. <br/>
<br/>
It would really useful to have a &#39;Trim Height&#39; or just a &#39;Height&#39; option in the toolmode bar for the linear insertion mode. This would enable users to enter a trim height using the toolmode bar short cut keys and greatly increase drawing speed for entertainment users

 <br/>
<br/>
at the moment, there is an ongoing discussion in the forum about<br/>
dividers for Layers and Sheets.<br/>
<br/>
Please see:<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/103708-dividers-for-layers-and-sheets/page/2/#comment-452792<br/>
<br/>
We also discussed the &quot;Saved Views&quot; palette.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to see an improvement for this kind of palette.<br/>
At the moment, the palette is only to represent the views but<br/>
nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
It would be useful to enhance the possibilities for this kind of<br/>
palette, to bring it to 21th century.<br/>
<br/>
Needed options:<br/>
<br/>
-Sorting options (#, names, … like the design layers)<br/>
- Search options<br/>
- &quot;real&quot; Dividers<br/>
- Colors options for text and underlying<br/>
- Tags<br/>
- UI-size for the text (text is to small to read)<br/>

                WISH: Better use of the arrow keys in Vectoworks
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      At the moment, the arrow keys are used for<br/>
panning in the workspace.<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP = pan upwards<br/>
ARROW DOWN = pan down<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is also possible and i find it good:<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = moves object upward<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT + CMD = moves object 10 units upwards<br/>
<br/>
…<br/>
<br/>
The panning behavior is no longer in keeping with the times,<br/>
since every user can do this either with his mouse<br/>
or with the trackpad can do this better.<br/>
<br/>
So we can think about how we can assign the arrow keys<br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>
Here are my suggestions, I think they make sense:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
In the Adobe or Affinity input fields, the arrow keys can be used to<br/>
Change value<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
ARROW UP = + one unit<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = + 10 units<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
ARROW DOWN = – one unit<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = – 10 units<br/>
<br/>
To activate this behavior, you only have to enter the input field.<br/>
<br/>
This makes so much sense, because you<br/>
can work much faster!<br/>
<br/>
Attached, you will find a sample video.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see this in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
Axis inferencing.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the axis directions can be fixed with the &quot;T&quot; key<br/>
during the drawing.<br/>
This solution is okay, but you always have to moving around with<br/>
the mouse and hover-over to find an axis of an existing object.<br/>
<br/>
This could be also done better with the arrow keys!<br/>
<br/>
I like the axis constrain of Sketchup.<br/>
There, you use the arrow keys.<br/>
Press arrow key to activate, press the same arrow key to<br/>
deactivate the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP: fixes drawing direction to z-Axis (blue)<br/>
ARROW RIGHT: fixes drawing direction to x-axis (red)<br/>
ARROW LEFT: fixes drawing direction to y-axis (green)<br/>
and special:<br/>
ARROW DOWN: fixes drawing direction to a custom direction<br/>
via hover-over a non-orthogonal line in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
This works also in Sketchup for drawing 2D geometry like rectangles, circles, …<br/>
or this works also for all the tools, e.g. Rotation Tool.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you want to rotate something 2D to stand up in 3D,<br/>
with the arrow keys, you can lock the VW Rotate Tool to rotation in z/x<br/>
or z/y direction.<br/>
<br/>
The behavior with the arrow keys in Sketchup is so intuitive and good designed<br/>
that it is a must to bring it to Vectorworks! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Words are not always good for explaining, so a<br/>
here is a link to a tutorial video:<br/>
<br/>
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IP1T77rjTg&amp;list=PL-bndkJaV8A7R2t970OmHY6kPGJwTfGP2&amp;index=27&amp;ab_channel=SketchUp]<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would really love to see this in Vectorworks!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Both suggested solutions are for me a better choice for the arrow keys.<br/>
I think panning with the arrow keys are old-school!

However, once you have more than one object selected, the latter doesn&#39;t work, i.e. you can&#39;t double click into any sort of container. The multiple selection prevents it entirely. You have to first deselect everything, then double click, make your edit, and finally re-select everything upon exiting the container.<br/>
<br/>
It would be much better if you could just double click on anything at any time and get the expected result, regardless of whether there&#39;s one thing, no thing, or multiple things selected.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To boil it down to a simple example: the goal would be to have two groups selected, double click on one of the groups, and end up inside that group. Bam.

A good solution for this issue could be:<br/>
- a check box to apply to all layers<br/>

or even better (not mentioned ion the video):<br/>
- a button which leads to a list of the stories, where you can check the stories (also by multiple selection) where you want the default level to be active.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest frustrations with using stories at this moment is that editing them means going through many confusing manipulations and dialogs. This option might be a step in a direction to make the workflow more streamlined.

While in many cases, you want to name the design layer the same as the story level itself (in the local workflow we have here, that&#39;s even always the case). Typing in the same name twice, feels like unnecessary double work.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I suggest to implement a checkbox &quot;same name as level&quot; in front of the design layer name field, so the design layer name can be filled in automatically by checking that box.<br/>

One of the biggest frustrations with using stories at this moment is that editing them means going through many confusing manipulations. this checkbox might be a small step in a direction to make the workflow more streamlined.

These sub- objects should always be placed in a neutral class, so the user can simply assign the correct class via the OIP and can manage visibilities without the need for editing the symbol.<br/>

we really do have customers complaining about text getting kinda of blurry when zooming. They become dizzy, woozy and a headache (or even a migraine) when zooming all the day.<br/>
I promised to create a wish for better text representation when zooming.<br/>
I did a video so you see the blurriness.<br/>
It affects drawings with lot of text.<br/>
We already told the customer that there is preview mode when zooming for better performance.<br/>

As part of workflows where an existing building must be modelled, it would be amazing to have a similar interactive insertion ability for walls...<br/>
<br/>
Requirement:<br/>
 * To be able to drawing the length AND thickness of a wall by clicking with the mouse only.<br/>
 * To be able to work with unstyled walls (at very least) and styled walls (ideally, or perhaps after future wall re-engineering.)  <br/>
<br/>
How it would work:<br/>
 # Activate the wall tool<br/>
 # Activate the interactive insertion mode of the wall tool. (This would by default draw an unstyled wall. As part of wall re-engineering, wall styles may be able to set one component to &quot;expand/contract&quot; to accommodate this interactive insertion mode. This would facilitate the inner- and outer-most components remaining constant thickness while the &quot;flexible&quot; component within the wall could accommodate the differences in thickness.)<br/>
 # The first click on the design layer starts drawing the wall&#39;s length (as it does now.)<br/>
 # The second click on the design layer end&#39;s drawing the wall&#39;s length (as it does now.)<br/>
 # The third click establishes the wall&#39;s thickness, from outside face to inside face. (If you {*}double{*}-click at this stage to set the wall&#39;s thickness, the wall drawing action is complete. On the other hand, if you {*}single-{*}click at this stage then the wall&#39;s thickness is set AND the cursor relocates its position to the click point from step 4 –  in order to draw the next segment of the wall using the three-click method{*}.{*})<br/>
 # (Optional bonus... Perhaps an additional click would allow you to set the height of the wall! That may be getting a bit carried away ;) )<br/>
<br/>
For a frame a reference, this interactive insertion mode for walls would behave similar to the current &quot;three points rotated&quot; modes of the rectangle tool and stair tool.

<br/>
When a user places an emitter with a manual radius, the manually set radius should be retained when changing the catalog data, unless it is outside the defined values of the selected emitter/nozzle definition.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally a manually set radius should only change in very limited circumstances once set.<br/>
 * If the manual radius is &lt; minimum radius value when the catalog data is changed, it should reset to the minimum value<br/>
 * If the manual radius is &gt; maximum radius value when the catalog data is changed it should reset to the maximum value.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases an emitter radius can be adjusted (25% is common), if this could be easily taken into account before changing radius values that would be great, too. But not required.

<br/>
Text-Styles are a bit too restrictive, because we don&#39;t have the option<br/>
<br/>
to save &quot;by style&quot; or &quot;by instance&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I often struggle with doing some changes in my text-style and all<br/>
<br/>
related texts get a forced update and my custom changes/alignments<br/>
<br/>
would be overwritten, but I do not want all updates<br/>
<br/>
e.g. the alignment horizontal or vertical.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This could be fixed, if we got the option to save<br/>
<br/>
&quot;by style&quot; or &quot;by instance&quot; in text-styles.<br/>

<br/>
it is often needed to having different Dimension-Standards/Styles,<br/>
<br/>
but we only have one option for the Standard-Class for all Dimension-Standards.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be useful to save the class of the Dimension inside the Dimension-Standard. With this solution, we are way more flexible with managing different dimensions.<br/>

This is my first JIRA-report. Sorry if I didn&#39;t make it right!<br/>

The &quot;Make All Attributes by Class&quot; command is something I use hundreds of times per day. Currently, it&#39;s absolutely laborious to try to click the tiny hamburger icon every time without accidentally undocking the Attributes Palette or clicking the question mark... I&#39;d much prefer to just hit a keystroke, but currently Users are not given the option of adding hotkeys for these commands since they only exist in the Attribute Palette menu.<br/>
<br/>
Pat Stanford graciously wrote me a script that mostly does what the &quot;Make All Attributes be Class&quot; command does, which I&#39;ve added to my workspace, but it doesn&#39;t work as flawlessly as the official built-in command. It would better for Vectorworks were to officially support this.<br/>
<br/>
I would even recommend adding these for commands by default into a submenu within the &quot;Modify&quot; or &quot;Tools&quot; menus, which would increase discoverability. Of course, the commands should also stay in the Attributes Palette as well.<br/>

This could tie in to the GUI improvement currently in the works.

<br/>
The Z information shown in the OIP is lacking. Currently the IOP shows the object&#39;s Z location relative to the active layer. If the active layer is changed the object&#39;s reported Z position may change. This makes it difficult to meaningfully know where an object is actually located in space. Knowing an object&#39;s Z position relative to the active layer&#39;s origin is not enough. Moving between layers does not change an object&#39;s X or Y value. Moving between layer should not change an object&#39;s Z value either. The only way to do this is to use geodetic Z values.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs to be able to report an object&#39;s geodetic elevation in the Object Information Palette. There should be an X, Y, Z and Geodetic Z field in the OIP. Further this geodetic field value should be editable just like the other fields.<br/>
<br/>
I have a work around for this shortcoming and it is super helpful for locating objects confidently. However, it is an extra few steps and may require the insertion of 3D loci.<br/>
<br/>
My work around for determining the true Z location of an object:<br/>
<br/>
Create a layer called &quot;Sea Level&quot; set its Z origin @ 0.<br/>
<br/>
Create a saved view called &#39;Go to Sea Level&#39;. This makes Sea Level the active layer without affecting layer or class settings.<br/>
<br/>
Select an object, run the saved view or just go to sea level layer. The OIP will now show the geodetic Z information of the object. See the last image.<br/>

<br/>
Wall Components in 2D Plan are drawn from left to right. The left one is at the bottom of the 2D stacking order, the right one is at the top. In most cases this is not apparent, because usually the contour lines of the components have the same color - only their thickness typically varies.<br/>
<br/>
However, some customers do use different colors for their components. Especially with data visualization, when they want to emphasize certain components for a specific construction phase of the building.<br/>
<br/>
In such a case they get undesired results - see attached screenshot, left image - &quot;one sided wall&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When component wrapping is applied, the problem becomes even more apparent (screenshot, middle image).<br/>
<br/>
What the customer expects, is shown in the image on the right.<br/>
<br/>
*Solution*<br/>
<br/>
Hard structural components should overlap softer, non structural components. For instance:<br/>
 # Load bearing should overlap insulation and plaster.<br/>
<br/>
 # Insulation should overlap air cavity.<br/>
<br/>
Since it might be hard to define the priority based on material properties (&#39;hard&#39;, &#39;softer&#39;, &#39;soft&#39;), the solution might be to offer a 2D stacking order in the wall style.

<br/>
We&#39;ll illustrate the problem with the wall styles, but it exists for all object styles.<br/>
<br/>
To get a proper file organization, the different types of walls are placed in (sub)folders in the .vwx file. Unfortunately, these (sub)folders are not visible in most parts of the interface. To our knowledge, this specific structure is only visible in the resource manager.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Walls<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
This tree structure should also be visible when replacing a wall style in the OIP. When selecting the wall to modify, you simply get the full list of all walls, either in the drawing itself or in the library. It would be better to be able to navigate through the created folders here too. If we then want to replace a foundation wall, we can first navigate to the foundation&#39;s folder and only see the associated walls instead of the entire list, which makes it very cluttered.

When you check off the option &quot;show 2D boundary&quot; in the OIP, selecting the space object is almost impossible, since the label is a separate object.<br/>
Now, the space is only selectable via a 2D locus. If you&#39;re lucky, this 2D locus is visible in the drawing but in many cases (depending on the wall configuration) this locus is hidden underneath the label or displaced to a complete different location.<br/>

At this moment, the core component is used as the main reference in the wall wrapping configuration. this seems to have as a result that the core component itself can&#39;t be wrapped. However, this is needed to be able to do some wall closure types. Changing the core in the wall style settings isn&#39;t a sufficient workaround, because that manipulation is too impactful on the rest of the drawing (slab- wall and roof- wall connections, connections between walls, alignments,...)<br/>

*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Wall<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
- Not only use a &quot;core&quot; component, but also have the option to use a &quot;structural&quot; component. While the core can be used for alignment and wrapping, the structural component can be used for connecting building shell element. Multiple components can be assigned as structural, which also fixed the &quot;wall between two appartments&quot;- issue.<br/>
<br/>
Or<br/>
<br/>
- The core component and the &quot;wrapping reference&quot; component can be the same by default, but the user can choose to set another component as wrapping reference independently.

                                            <td class="description">      *Describe the problem:*<br/>
When you create an elevation via a section viewport, the line thicknesses are determined by the line thicknesses of the objects in 2D plan. Usually, this is not relevant for an elevation view and leads to a messy and poorly readable drawing.<br/>
One thing you can currently already do, is use one class to control all line thicknesses behind the cut plane. This is a recommended option to make the drawing cleaner, but still comes with its issues. Readability is still poor, because there&#39;s no sense of depth and it puts also the surface hatch lines in that same class, which is an undesired side effect (I&#39;ll make a bug report for that last one)<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Create section viewport<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
In the advanced settings of a section viewport, there should be an interface which allows the user to control the line thickness of objects by a depth range. For example: all objects between 0 and 3m behind cut plane have a thickness of 0,5mm, between 3 and 6 0,25 and so on. This setting should NOT affect the line thickness of surface hatches.<br/>
<br/>
*Remark:*<br/>
<br/>
It is preferable to use &#39;section viewports&#39; over &#39;elevation views&#39; (back / front / left / right) for the creation of facade views. The elevation views are limited to 90° angles (which leaves a &#39;gap&#39; for facades that are at a different angle), and the &#39;elevation views&#39; do not cut through the terrain model.

<br/>
The current vehicle libraries only offers 3D and 2D-plan views. Customers are asking for proper / clean 2D side, front and back views of the library objects.<br/>
<br/>
The views that are generated automatically by Vectorworks are not clean enough (and Vectorworks regularly crashes when generating the side views). Please check the attached images to see the quality difference between the top view that is included in the vehicle symbol, and the side views that are generated by Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
*Solution*<br/>

We need to manually add the side views to the vehicle symbols

<br/>
That system works, but it has a major limitation. Since it is read-only, the selection field (drop down in the OIP in the movie) doesn&#39;t show which set was selected or applied last. We can save that information in the object, but that would slow down the display of the data in the OIP significantly.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks would offer a way via the SDK to store a data set as a resource (and let the user manage it accordingly), then the speed hit would most likely disappear. We can currently not use Object styles for that, because the object style applies to the full object - not to specific parts of it. A sub-objectstyle of sorts might be a potential solution. <br/>
<br/>
This problem also ties into the control over sub-objects in larger parametric objects. There, too, we feel the need to define &#39;sets&#39; that can be treated and managed as a resource.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie shows the problem for our Window tool, but it exists for all complex objects in Vectorworks.

 <br/>
This is how I imagined that search bar in a dialog (see video in attachment).<br/>
There are a few things I&#39;m not sure about: # While changing a parameter, should that search &quot;popover&quot; stay open or should it close (like I show in the mockup)<br/>
 # Is it up to the developer to categorize the control (in that &quot;category&quot; (group box, tab) the control will show in the search &quot;popover&quot;), or is the system smart enough to figure it out by itself?<br/>
 # Should all controls be adjustable in the search &quot;popover&quot; or is this something the developer should decide?<br/>
 # That flare when clicking on an entry in the search popover: should it only happen for disabled controls or for all?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that flare has to be more clear? Or last longer? Or maybe something else that draws the user&#39;s attention (that blur overlay maybe?). But I&#39;m sure [@ilane|https://designexpress.slack.com/team/U4ZEY8UER] and team can come up with something nice for this !https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f642.png! (if this idea gets accepted off course).<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and off course, when hitting cmd+F/ctrl+F in a dialog, that same search bar should roll out and become active.<br/>

The way a texture is mapped by default when you place it on a rectangular extrude is different in version 2022/2023 compared to 2021. Now the mapping mode is &quot;Surface UV&quot; in stead of &quot;Perimeter&quot; before.<br/>
As a consequence of this, since version 2022, the texture is applied rotated compared to the texture preview on the sides of a rectangular extrude.<br/>
The result in version 2021 was better.<br/>
This has been reported as a bug (0007121) but has been categorized as &quot;works as designed&quot; in Jira.<br/>

*Optional: solution:*<br/>
- Edit the behavior of &quot;Surface UV&quot; so the result is more desirable<br/>
or<br/>

If we draw a volume in Vectorworks, by drawing a line on one of the faces I can split this face in order to extrude or pull back the volume below or above the line. You would then think that this plane now consists of 2 separate planes, so you can apply different textures to the part above the line and below the line. However, if you want to place a texture on this plane, it will be seen again as one plane and the line has no influence on it.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
If you divide a surface by means of a line, you can not only adjust the volume with it, but also have the possibility to give these surfaces a separate texture.

The possibility to also choose a uniform color as the fill color for the volumes. Now we must first make a texture of a fill color before it can be applied as a fill to an object. A possible interim solution could be to draw a surface with the correct fill color and convert it with a right mouse click to a texture. The shortest way is of course that when selecting the tool you can choose between a texture or a 2D attribute fill.

For a wall or a slab , the texture and its surface hatch don&#39;t follow the orientation of the object. When the plug-in object is not orthogonally oriented, the problem is clearly visible.<br/>
<br/>
The only workaround I found is to set the plug-in object Texture option to &quot;Use object Textures&quot;. Then in the IOP, I can apply a rotation to the texture. But when the object will rotate again, the problem will still be there.

<br/>
If I want to replace the wall style of an existing wall, I can do so via the OIP. However, Vectorworks doesn&#39;t ask me about the location for the replacing wall style. The new wall style is automatically put in the root folder of the .vwx file. I have to manually move it to the correct folder.<br/>
<br/>
*Solution:*<br/>
If I&#39;m replacing a wall, I&#39;d also like to see the dialogue first to save my wall in the correct place in my drawing before closing the wall replacement window.

When importing a resource into a vwx file through the Resource Manager, a dialog pops up asking which organizational method should be used (keep folder structure, select different destination folder, create new resource folder).<br/>
<br/>
When I select a wall style from the tool dropdown, I don&#39;t get prompted about the desired resource location. The used resource is simply place in the root of the vwx file. If you want to reorganize it, you have to do it manually after the facts.<br/>

If a wall is placed via any method (resource manager/method bar) you always get the window where you want to place that wall in the drawing, unless you as a user have checked the option not to show this window anymore.

We can adjust the texture per side via the info palette, but first we have to select the wall and then the side of the wall to give a different texture for this side.. Much more intuitive would be with the texture tool sliding over the wall and the lightening side of the wall via a click of the texture it could provide.

I&#39;ve noticed that the update of libraries in Vectorworks is happening in the background and once you&#39;ve updated your libraries with new content available, you don&#39;t know what is actually new. It could improve the UX, if new resources stand out a bit more.<br/>

1.) Add a separate &quot;New&quot; category in the Resource Manager to existing ones (Premium libraries, Vectorworks libraries etc.) and make Vectorworks remove the content of that category after a specific period of time OR<br/>
2.) Add a visual label to resources (for example in the preview dialog in the upper right corner of the Resource Manager) OR<br/>
3.) Add a tag &quot;New&quot; to the list of tags<br/>

 # Allow a slope between 0° and 2°. From a construction POV a 2° limit might seem like a logical choice, but designers prefer to use 0° for esthetic reasons (even if it might not be constructed that way).<br/>
 # Allow a negative slope value, so that the shed and the main roof meet each other at a &#39;negative V&#39; or gutter.

He mentioned that one of the things slowing down his Spotlight workflow vs his old AutoCAD workflow was setting up and configuring Viewports in Vectorworks. Specifically in AutoCAD users can hover the mouse pointer over a viewport and then use the mouse wheel to interactively zoom/scale the view, without having to go through multiple mouse clicks and/or dialogues.<br/>
His typical workflow is to set the viewport up for a specific paper size and then adjust the zoom/scale to best display the part of his design it is documenting

To mitigate the confusion and wasted time with having to download the Vectorworks viewer, why can&#39;t it be, for desktop users, online (like BIM 360), or for those on devices, via the Nomad app?<br/>
<br/>
Expecting clients to download a 750+Mb (!!) installer is unrealistic and does the platform a disservice by making it too hard to view files.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as more customers are switching to subscriptions with people dipping in and out, this issue becomes only more important. I consider this an existential thread to the quality of the customer experience (or as Tim &#39;Apple&#39; would say, &#39;customer sat&#39;).

<br/>
There may be reasons for it to remain open, but after a mental exercise considering why that might be valid, I think the reasons to close it and the workflow benefits of doing so far outweigh the reasons to keep it open. <br/>
<br/>
Reasons that{color:#172b4d} is should stay open are below. Refutes are indented. {color}<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}One may accidentally click the wrong tool and want another chance to select another without delay. {color}<br/>
 ** {color:#172b4d}BUT: Accidental clicks will be a tiny minority and reopening the SOD is one spacebar tap away. {color}<br/>
<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}When Standard Views are one of the options offered in the Smart Options Display, one may like to click through multiple views one after the other. {color}<br/>
 ** {color:#172b4d}BUT: This can be achieved using the keyboard NumberPad - which is perpetually available - or the Flyover tool. {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#172b4d}Reasons the Smart Options Display should close after a selection is made: {color}<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}The va{color}st majority of selections made will be the desired option. <br/>
 * The palette will cease to obscure the drawing behind immediately after the pertinent tool is chosen allowing the users focus to be directed to the area of the drawing for which the tool was selected. <br/>
 * The user does not need to move the cursor away from the SOD only to have to bring it back again (when the subject is under the SOD palettes which was the case in my demonstration). <br/>
 * This will make it unnecessary to perform _another action_ to make it close. Either moving the cursor away or tapping the Spacebar again (which interestingly does not require the cursor to remain still!) <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I vote that the Smart Options Display close as soon as a tool/option is selected. An example of the SOD being unexpectedly in the way presents itself perfectly when I was recording a demonstration for my other, previous VE. I&#39;ve attached the same recording to this task so you may see what I mean. <br/>

I&#39;ve adopted what has already been created for Graphic Legends to show what I mean below.<br/>
<br/>
!Viewport Annotation Layout.png|width=588,height=341!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I believe the Drawing Label is automatically placed on the bottom/center of the Viewport and then has to manually be adjusted (correct me if I am wrong). This would provide an excellent way to set labels up from the beginning removing many unnecessary clicks. Example: you have a sheet with a dozen detail viewports, each with a drawing label and you want to either left or right-justify them. If you adjust this style setting, all details will pick up the new location of the Drawing Label.<br/>

<br/>
At least if it was offset from the edge of the display, that behaviour wouldn&#39;t be so aggressive - and it is perceived as a valued part of Vectorworks, not some dodgy pop-up window preventing me from going to the next task.<br/>

I apologise is this VE request sounds direct, but the psychological implications of each features need to be thought through – esp when UI/IX overwhelms cognitive load, design workflow and impedes task switching.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Smart Options Display is the most impactful UI enhancement I can remember. It has sped up my workflow and it has further potential to make working in Vectorworks even better, _ever-faster_ and more enjoyable with just a few minor tweaks. My submission affects every user and every use of this function: _Activating_ the Smart Options Display. <br/>
<br/>
*The problem:* <br/>
<br/>
Currently the Smart Options Display is activated when the Spacebar key is depressed-and-released quickly. But for this to work there is an undisclosed requirement: The cursor must not be moving at the time. This is both unexpected, unnatural and unnecessary. <br/>
 * Unexpected because users are [schooled by Vectorworks Help|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Start/Smart_Options_Display.htm] that if the spacebar is tapped, the Smart Options Display will appear. There is no stipulation in Vectorworks Help that the cursor must be still. <br/>
 * Unnatural because all other functions activated by keyboard commands are not contingent on the cursor being unmoving. <br/>
 * Unnecessary because (as far as I can see) there would be no conflicts with other UI functions if it was set up to be triggered simply by tapping the Spacebar irrespective of cursor movement. The Boomerang Pan Tool activates when the Spacebar is held down. The Smart Options Display appears only if the Spacebar _comes up again_ within an instant so no conflict will occur between the two functions. <br/>
<br/>
The way it currently works requires that users with a mouse, must stop moving it before they can activate this function. If they were moving the cursor to where it is needed, this means the must stop moving, tap Spacebar, start moving again towards the desired tool, stop to click on the tool, then continue to move to the precise location it will be used. <br/>
<br/>
For users that draw with a graphics tablet, the cursor moves constantly while the pen hovers above the tablet surface. This means the Smart Options Display can&#39;t be activated reliably or easily. The user must lift the pen up out of the tablet&#39;s range of reception for the cursor to stop moving or rest it on the surface so lightly that a &#39;click&#39; is not triggered (which is nigh impossible and even harder when working at-speed). Lifting the pen out of range is an ergonomic nightmare as it strains the wrist to lift it high enough, especially when done a lot. The Smart Options Display is intended to be used for various functions that are needed most often, so it will be used frequently increasing the risk of OOS/RSI. <br/>
<br/>
*The Solution:* <br/>
<br/>
Adjust the software so that the Smart Options Display is triggered when the Spacebar is depressed-and-released within the required time, _irrespective_ of cursor movement. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We would like to prep our BIM templates (with Stories and wall styles) in the English version of Vectorworks. Right now we need to do this in the localized version, otherwise our own story levels don’t appear in the .sta files. This is a change that needs to be facilitated by VW, inc.<br/>
<br/>
Question 2:<br/>
<br/>
We translate the templates automatically via the sdk, for all our localized languages. But for the templates we cannot translate them in the English Vectorworks, because the stories are default imported in a localized Vectorworks version. We always need to translate the templates in the corresponding localized Vectorworks version. Quite annoying and time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Can this be changed? Via sdk?<br/>

The stories and levels are to much fixed in Vectorworks. They should be more flexible.

<br/>
1. It would be nice to be able to navigate to the cell item in the resource folder (or go directly to edit it) from the cell. We are using graphic legends with walls, roofs and slabs and making data changes right from the cell would save us from having to navigate the resource manager to find the correct item.<br/>
2. In the dialog box for Cell Visibility and Sorting there is a Show column, which allows you to show or hide a cell. The problem is that if you hide a cell, and later go back to show it, the annotations get deleted. I would not expect this behaviour from the term &quot;show&quot; or &quot;hide&quot;. If it is technically not possible to save the annotations so that they can reappear when clicking hide, then a warning should appear if you are setting a cell to hide and it has annotations. I think a similar warning should be present for viewports as well. A visual non-printing reminder of whether or not a cell (or viewport) has content would be very useful.

<br/>
Regarding to VB-191675 it is not a bug. So it&#39;s at least a wish then.<br/>
<br/>
BLK Corner don&#39;t really need truss pieces on every exit.<br/>
In reality you have a trussline with two BLK corner on every end.<br/>
You attach two hoist on the corner blocks and lift them up.<br/>
Braceworks doesn&#39;t like that and needs another truss line on one exit of the corner.<br/>

For me, this is a very useful modifying command for working on floating text objects in construction details, and general notes on sheets. Text Merge has been in use in AutoCAD for many years, and its competitor BricsCAD also recently added it. The command takes away the tedium of having to select text content in a block of text, cut or copy it, and then pasting it at the end of another block of text. I always add it to my workspace whenever I update the Vectorworks version. I don&#39;t know who is the author of this (Julian Carr MIGHT have written it), but I got the script on a message board somewhere, and made a menu command from it. When the command starts, the cursor turns into a target, and the user clicks on the first block of text to be merged. After clicking on the second text and so on with the same target cursor, the user clicks on an empty space, and the selected text objects are all merged.

When working with production design and previs department it would be amazing to be able to export Redshift Proxies to be used by previs in Maya, Blender or Houdini. <br/>
<br/>
Redshift proxies export the entire scene, lighting and textures as a redshift file that can be used in other applications running redshift. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how hard redshift proxie export would be to implement now that the redshift renderer seems to be working so well.  <br/>
<br/>
Off-course USD (Universal Scene Description) would be the unltimate goal.

In order to make this capability more apparent to the user, an Import Layer command would raise a similar dialog. Ideally, in addition to the list of Standard layers, the user would see open and recent drawing files, similar to the options in the Resource Manager.<br/>

This workflow would also be very familiar to Adobe users.
