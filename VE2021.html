<br/>
If we export an .obj from vectorworks, we do not have integrated UV mapping there. This has the consequence that you have to use external software like blender to add a UV mapping to the OBJ file.<br/>
<br/>
Can we add the UV mapping to our OBJ export?<br/>
<br/>
It will speed up the workflow between VWX and media servers like Disguise.<br/>
<br/>
This request comes from Sage Entertainment and Disney!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and stay healthy!

<br/>
I tested this in both 2021 sp3.1 and in the current 2022 beta 2 release after adding a consumer electrical component to the hoist symbol definition<br/>
<br/>
This is fine when the hoist is in the standard configuration (hoist down symbol type) but if the hoist is hung inverted (hoist up symbol) it means the cable will be too short to connect to the hoist by whatever the current chain length of the hoist is (potentially 24m or more!)<br/>
<br/>
to reproduce<br/>
<br/>
in 2021<br/>
<br/>
insert a truss line add a hoist with using a &#39;up&#39; orientated symbol<br/>
<br/>
activate the cable tool<br/>
<br/>
use the single connection mode and insert the cable to connect to the hoist,<br/>
<br/>
the cable will insert connected to the low hook of the hoist and ignore the position of the hoist body<br/>
<br/>
in 2022<br/>
<br/>
add a consumer electrical component to the hoist symbol definition and repeat the previous workflow. the cable will again insert at the low hook height.

<br/>
At the moment, you can&#39;t use the localised mapping of line types on LAs - even if you&#39;re setting it up in the polygon you then convert to a LA, it reverts to original size when converting.<br/>
<br/>
After it is a LA, there&#39;s no way to adjust the size of the line type.<br/>
<br/>
This ought to be steered by the style, just as the fill.<br/>

From the user perspective a +{color:#172b4d}fundamental requirement{color}+ of this feature is being able to use the power planning data to create their show or event paperwork. I have attached some examples of what users want to be able to create (the cable patch sheet would in our case reference the breakout or plug box distributor, but would provide the same info). All of the required information to create these is in the the Power overview and Power Patch panes.<br/>

This means Users have to be able to access the information from the Power Overview and Power Patch Table panes of the Electrical View web palette in worksheets.<br/>

<br/>
This severely limits the use of worksheets for example in creating printable labels that have to fit in specific dimensions. The Scale Factor parameter that has been added is only an overall scale so you can choose between correct X or correct Y...but not both.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to have OIP controls as per a rectangle i.e. X, Y, DX and DY so that the user can precisely size the object. Row and column boundaries would be proportional to those set in the worksheet.<br/>

SDK calls must also be provided so that this feature can be used programmatically.<br/>

Applications for this in ConnectCAD would be:<br/>
 # Labeling for all standard rack-mount panels (jackfields, term panels etc.)<br/>
 # Cable labeling - e.g. self-adhesive cable labels are commercially available on standard sheets. Each sheet has an array of labels at specific spacings. This feature would allow us to implement *one-click label printing* direct from Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
For our purposes internally in ConnectCAD even just having API to do separate X and Y scaling would allow us to tick these boxes for now and we can follow improvements later.<br/>
<br/>
This matter has been outstanding for decades. Thanks to Jim for bring it to my attention - I had given up.

<br/>
Open the added file, open &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;stories&quot;, click on &quot;Default Story Levels&quot; and edit the &quot;Elevation Offset&quot;, confirm, leave the window and click on &quot;Edit …&quot;. Now you will see the level type &quot;UK RD&quot; is duplicated with the new old (-0,24) and the new value (-0,22). The new value has to be checked, confirm the window. Reopen &quot;Organization&quot; , click on &quot;Edit…&quot; now you will see, that the old level is deleted.<br/>
This is since Version 2014 annoying. <br/>
The Elevation Offset field is or should be a common input field and in case of changing the value it has to have directly an effect. There is no reason to make a copy … and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the movie. <br/>

We finally got them to move to 2021 and most is well received, but they have an issue with the eyedropper tool. The (main, not the built into the LA tool itself) doesn&#39;t work on landscape areas in 2021.<br/>
 I did file this before, T02093. The response I got was that it works as designed and that it doesn&#39;t work on other things, so why should it work on Landscape areas.<br/>
<br/>
However, working with landscape and working with buildings require very different workflows, and I don&#39;t see why we should remove a good tool for the Landmark people just because it&#39;s not a way to work in Architecture. <br/>
<br/>
In one project you might have hundreds of landscape areas and maybe 20-30 different mixes, which often aren&#39;t repeated to other projects. It is a very useful workflow to be able to &#39;drop&#39; the content from one LA to another instead of having to go in and replace the style - often it&#39;s much easier to work with unstyled landscape areas. It requires many more clicks to replace the style via the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
It is the same with plant styles - you can very easily have 100-150 different plant styles in a project (even in small garden designs) and this creates very different workflows than if you have a handful of styles of walls/slabs/windows etc. Anything we can do to streamline the work should be protected and not removed to fit in with other disciplines.

Open a new blank Vectorworks file.<br/>
With the resource browser pointed to HS Library.vwx Place three hardscape objects in the new blank file by dragging the hardscape style objects from the HS Library (in the resource browser) into the drawing window of the new blank file.<br/>
<br/>
Note that each of the hardscapes placed in the new file have different names.  These are the names of the hardscape when the style was created.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that each of the hardscape styles are found in a folder of the same name as in the library file.<br/>
 <br/>
Duplicate the third placed hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
From the resource browser Drag one of the Hardscape styles over one of the placed hardscapes in the new file (with a different style) to change the style of the placed hardscape.  Note that the name changes to match that from the style and the hardscape appearance matches the new style.  This is the expected behaviour.  Note also that the hardscape styles remain in the same folder.<br/>
<br/>
Select the third hardscape and using the object info pallet style pull down replace the style with the style with the first object shown in the resulting dialog. Do not attempt to select a different different style.  Note that the resultant hardscape name does not change to match the style.  This is the bug and it is concerning as it might result in a number of placed hardscape objects that have names that do not match there appearance leading to quantity take off errors.<br/>
<br/>
There appears to be a second bug if you select a style other than the first one offered and this will be reported separately.

If you&#39;re going in to change the 2D component via the Resource Manager, and use the &#39;Edit 2D component&#39;, you come into the &#39;normal&#39; window for editing PIOs 2D components. If you make a change, you&#39;ll then only get a square as a 2D view every time you create a new LA instead of the shape you&#39;re actually drawing. You have actually created a separate &#39;2D look&#39; for the LA, based on the sample rectangle seen in the RM.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to do it today is to un-style the LA, change the colour, and create a new style - a bit convoluted.

When using the insert connection or insert drop command with an inverted hoist the body of the hoist always inserts inside of the upper truss. There is no way to change this, if the user changes the high hook height the truss moves with the hook<br/>

The hoist body should be inserted just below the truss geometry not inside<br/>

insert 2 trusses, one directly above the other with enough vertical space between them to insert a drop<br/>
<br/>
activate the insert connection tool select insert drop mode and choose any inverted hoist symbol (&#39;up&#39; in the name) and insert normally<br/>
<br/>
body of the inserted hoist will be inside the upper truss<br/>

if the high hook field is used in the truss properties to change the high hook and hoist body height then the truss moves with the change

we have one of our Stockists asking why Import Point Cloud has a limit of only 35 million points?<br/>
<br/>
He also states that the complete Project that a Customer has has 9.5 billion points and after being clean it has 665 million points.<br/>
<br/>
Two example files are attached. One with around 39 million points and the other with around 15 million points. I had to zip one of the files because it is more than 1GB in size.

However, a layer certain layer visibility in vwx, &quot;grey others&quot; helps to complete certain tasks, like moving objects while sort of seeing other ghosted objects and have those as visual references, or temporal snaps. Now, while having one of these on screen and click on the TM direct link eye, geometry moves into TM with greyed out objects having a solid grey color.  This behavior I believe is unexpected, as a matter of fact, perhaps not even needed, since the main goal using these two applications in tandem is to achieve renderings and animations, even TM already has a few features like that for x-ray objects. My suggestion is that exporting geometry while in &quot;grey others mode&quot; should remove ghosted object from being included in the data sent to TM

We are encountering issues consuming the FBX files generated by Vectorworks when loading them into DCCs - specifically both Maya and Houdini. The issues we are running into are broadly: 1. Objects which should be exported as single objects come in split apart into many objects. 2. Normals and winding order are randomly flipped and do not properly represent the exterior side of surfaces. More specifically, - Mirrored geometry comes in inverted / normals are pointing the wrong way. EXAMPLE. What should be the outside of the surface is pointing the wrong direction. Essentially the winding order is reversed causing the normals to point in the wrong direction. - Normals/winding order for geometry which is concave AND does not have any volume/thickness associated with it is flipped so that the surface points the wrong direction. EXAMPLE. We see this happening quite often when we add thickness to a complex flat surface. The surface usually does not export as a single object and the normals and the concave areas of the extruded sides come in broken into their own piece and the normals are pointing towards the inside of the extruded volume. - When we export objects that should be solid they come in broken apart. EXAMPLE. Walls, they usually come in broken apart and are not solid surfaces. Maybe this can be resolved by having a solid object toggle on each symbol which informs the FBX export? - Applying multiple material to an object or partial materials to an object (only a set of faces) results in an object that exports as several pieces. EXAMPLE. a Wall with a material on each face will come in broken apart based on the martial assignment. - Site models export as separated polygons. It would be good to have this export as a single object and currently requires additional work to make it export as a single object. - Groups are not retained in the FBX. The FBX recognized the symbols are retained but not the grouping structure present in Vectorworks. It appears that the symbol is converted into a group but the true scene organization is lost.<br/>
Steps: 1 - load file 2 - select File-&gt;Export-&gt;Export FBX 3 - use the following settings: Export: All Visible Objects on All Layers Scene Organization: Native Vectorworks Organization Include: Geometry, Materials and Texture Tags If the scene is big enough, we will also just export Selected Objects on Active Layer, and have at times had to use the Fast Renderworks render mode.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have included their vectorworks file, FBX file and many screen shots showing the issues they describe.  The screenshots are how they see the export in Houdini<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if this is a bug or should be submitted as an enhancement.  I have not had someone use Vectorworks so extensively to export as an FBX

<br/>
The new tumble mode button initiates tumbling animation which lasts until the mode button is toggled again, the tool becomes inactive, ESC is pressed, or a dialog becomes active.  The tumble path is a sine wave on the surface of an virtual sphere whose center of rotation is the flyover anchor point (which depends on the active flyover mode).  Note the anchor point does not have to be in the center of the view, or even in-view.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus feature: A &#39;create animation&#39; button in the preferences can be clicked to have an Animation Path object created for the tumble.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-07-21-14-23-55-924.png!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some new preferences are added to the Flyover settings dialog:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-07-21-14-24-18-543.png!<br/>
 * The &quot;horizontal speed&quot; controls the horizontal speed of motion.  Positive values indicate clockwise rotation (when viewed from above) and negative values indicate the opposite.<br/>
 * The &quot;vertical speed&quot; slider controls the vertical speed of motion.  Positive values indicate moving upward initially and negative values indicate the opposite.<br/>
 * The &quot;min angle&quot; and &quot;max angle&quot; (theta in wikipedia&#39;s &#39;[spherical coordinate system|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system]&#39; diagram) controls how low/high the tumble path will oscillate.  The range is -90 to +90 degrees.<br/>
 * An optional &quot;start angle&quot; may be provided.  If unspecified (or unchecked) then the start angle depends on the viewing angle when the tumble is initiated (capped between the min and max specified angles)<br/>
 * A Preview/stop button.  The preview uses the tumble parameters set in this dialog and those parameters can change and be visualized interactively.  The preview will stop when the dialog is closed.<br/>
 * Bonus:  Create Animation Path button to create an Animation Path object that users can edit.<br/>
<br/>
When the tumble animation is active, the next action will stop the animation.  That includes bringing up a dialog, switching to a different tool, boomerang to Pan tool, click to start a flyover, switch layer, change class visibility, switch render mode, etc.<br/>

In vw2022 the working plane immediately shows when switching to a 3D view.  Extra steps are required to hide it.  This task makes the working plane display rules in 3D more consistent with the 2D rules in effect making it slightly more difficult to discover the working plane but giving a clean view when going to 3D and gives consistency to the working plane in 3D and 2D.<br/>
The red/green/blue working plane axes will be hidden in 3D views when the  working plane is aligned with the layer plane.  The &quot;Select Working Plane&quot; menu item must be invoked to select the working plane in order to move/orient it.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open a blank file in 2021 and place a Wall<br/>
-In the Render tab of the OIP, assign an Overall texture<br/>
-Now activate the Left or Right texture Parts<br/>
<br/>
Note that the OIP shows a &quot;Revert to Overall&quot; button that lets you match that part to the Overall texture.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try the same thing in 2022<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the only apparent way to get the part to Overall is to use the &quot;Remove Texture&quot; menu option, even if that part doesn&#39;t have a texture applied.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see anything in the task doc about this and didn&#39;t see any other bug reports, but this seems kind of counter-intuitive and difficult to discover from a user&#39;s perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the &quot;Remove Texture&quot; command should just be renamed to &quot;Revert to Overall&quot;, since that seems to be what it&#39;s doing anyway?

<br/>
Whenever a user is working with the new power planning input and output drop-downs to connect electrical components or other objects the drop-down will close as soon as a single choice/option has been selected.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is there are many cases where Users want to be able to make several connections at the same time and the user will often want the drop-down to stay open so that they can see what has been chosen/connected.<br/>
<br/>
For example inside a distributor object it is normal that multiple fuses connect to each phase (L1, L2, L3) of an input.<br/>
<br/>
Currently the workflow is that the user has to group select all the fuses for each phase and then select the input drop-down to make the connection.<br/>
<br/>
While this works it is not easy to work in the other direction, i.e from the input to the fuse as the drop down will close each time a connection is make. This can make it hard to maintain an overview of what is connected where and especially in complex distributors hard to error check if mistakes have been made.<br/>
<br/>
When working with objects like lights and breakouts it restricts and slows down the workflow of how users must connect them if they want to connect multiple consumers to a single channel.<br/>
<br/>
For example if you want 2 lights connected to the same output of a breakout you need to select them both and make the connection from the from their properties,<br/>
<br/>
However if the user wants to work in the other direction (from the breakout) they will need to reopen the output drop-down for each light slowing the workflow and adding more mouse clicks.

What do you think about a feature that allows to see the point of view of the lighting fixture? It could be a button in the object info palette visible only when one single lighting fixture is selected, that set a view from the lens. and allow to better focus the beam using Pan and Tilt values.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to start learning Revit &amp; Navisworks to teach students (don&#39;t worry - still pushing Vectorworks whenever I can!). I&#39;m going to start to compile a &#39;Feature&#39; list of cool things that I think Vectorworks should include.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the start... (I&#39;ll include an attachment that includes screen grabs):<br/>
<br/>
NAVISWORKS<br/>
 # Navisworks has cool ‘3^rd^ person in ‘Realism’ options’<br/>
 # There’s also an option here for ‘Crouch’ mode when going under low spaces:<br/>
 # Navisworks also has full collision detection<br/>
 # What’s also cool is that as you use walkthrough &amp; hit the bottom of the stairs Navisworks knows that you intend to walk up them so it ‘walks’ up each step. The ‘Gravity’ option gives you weight so that as you walk down the steps you are weighted down to the ground:

<br/>
There is no height - neither in PIO parameters, nor in the object geometry (it&#39;s 2D only). <br/>
<br/>
So, IFC Export works with a fixed height being a little above the minimum height of a parking space, necessary for cargo operations, according to US Department of Transportation. <br/>
(In case, you&#39;re wondering about the fixed value)<br/>
<br/>
Please, add a request for Parking Space PIO, not for IFC Export.<br/>

<br/>
It was stated in this thread that &quot;I think these settings can be saved across sessions, if we&#39;re not doing that then it could be considered a bug that we&#39;ll investigate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this was addressed at the time or not, but currently I&#39;m finding that Quick Search is not remembering my previous searches from one session to the next. For example, if I type &#39;R&#39; and choose Rectangle, then restart Vectorworks and hit &#39;R&#39; again, it&#39;s back to the default results starting with Redo.<br/>

<br/>
Open the attached document and notice that Symbols 1, 2 and 4 can be scaled asymmetrically, but Symbols 3 and 134 *can* *not*.<br/>
There&#39;s a screenshot of the produced error message - _&quot;Some of the objects in the symbol could not be scaled asymmetrically.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Create an extrude out of a polygon, rectangle or any other shape.<br/>
2) Rotate the extrude 45 degrees.<br/>
3) Create a Symbol from that extrude.<br/>
4) Notice that when applying an asymmetric scaling on a single axis the extrude isn&#39;t scaled - an error message is shown.<br/>
<br/>
This might be WAD, as I have seen marked on some similar bugs. But scaling asymmetrically in the direction of the extrusion seems like it should work even on rotated extrudes. As this type of scaling will preserve the object type.

<br/>
&gt;On a simple solid where there are no curve faces this implementaion is fine,<br/>
 because the orientation of the textures is always going to be same.<br/>
&gt;But on solid object with a combination of curves faces and flat faces, this implementation<br/>
 falls short.<br/>
&gt;Notice on the second object it has a combination of flat faces and curves faces. Notice <br/>
 when I appy the same texture.<br/>
&gt;On the second object, I applied the texture on the flat face and selected that face in the object info palette<br/>
&gt;Now when I apply the same texture on the diffrenent face, the curve face (fillet) notice the different orientation.<br/>
&gt;When I change the orientation it will change the texture of the previous face, because it is still the one being currently selected.<br/>
&gt;This one of the simple example where the face should be automatically selected.<br/>
&gt;It removes one less step, the user doesn&#39;t have to click on the correct face in the object info palette, <br/>
 just change the orientation value.

And you want to reorder them to be sequential from L to R, if you use the Spotlight numbering tool, and start clicking manually from L to R, the little cursor value would lead you to believe you are putting down the correct number. But that isn&#39;t true, because if you try to put down A1, it won&#39;t let you, because there already is an A1. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the solution is here, but if the cursor makes it looks like you&#39;re about to place A3, but in reality it becomes A5, that&#39;s a problem. At that point, the program is knowingly giving you inaccurate information. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a better solution to renumbering Focus Point that I&#39;m not thinking of? If you need to rename existing with names already on the drawing (in essence, just rearranging them) it&#39;s actually quite a headache since two points can never share the same name.

I think the OpenGL &quot;Detail&quot; setting should default to &quot;High&quot;.  Not only will this give more expected results, it will give a far better first impression of the software and first impressions are critical for potential new users.

This is super important to any user regardless of industry.<br/>
<br/>
However, since this Quick Pref is hidden by default, many new users to Vectorworks don&#39;t realize it&#39;s even an option. I teach many novice Vectorworks users, some of which have previously explored the software on their own. Every single time that I suggest they make that Quick Pref button visible, the reaction is &quot;Holy cow that makes so much sense and is super handy, why is that not available by default?&quot; And I tend to agree with them :-)<br/>
<br/>
This particular Quick Pref button should be made visible for all users from the get-go. (While it&#39;s easy to turn on with the flyout menu, there are MANY steps of understanding before a new user would discover this on their own. I&#39;ve yet to see someone do this without being instructed to.)<br/>
<br/>
I would also propose adding the &quot;Show Clip Cube&quot; button and the &quot;Auto-Join Walls&quot; button to the default Quick Prefs, as these are additional commonly used settings that most users should be aware of by default. But these have secondary importance compared to &quot;Show Other Objects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, if there&#39;s a concern about their being &#39;too many&#39; Quick Pref buttons by default, I&#39;d suggest removing the &quot;Data Bar and Edit Group Options.&quot; I rarely see folks use this.<br/>
<br/>
This improvement would be one step towards making the software easier for new users.

Each panel of an LED screen will have a set weight. At the moment, the LED Screen object has a Distributed Weight field which does not calculate the load for based on the number of panels.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to drastically incorrect load calculations.<br/>
<br/>
To accurately calculate the weight of an LED screen/wall, one needs to manually figure out the linear distributed weight. This calculation needs to be done EVERY time the user makes a change to the height of their LED screen.<br/>
<br/>
Likely the best place for this field is right under the Width &amp; Height fields. Thus, the user will see it at the start and enter what they need.

<br/>
LED Screen is a great tool, and really fast to build screens.<br/>
<br/>
Many times, I need to create LED Screens with real accessory behind the modules count. Then I had to work with 3D symbols with more real geometry than LED Screen. <br/>
<br/>
See my exemple, with ABSEN PL2.5Pro in 3D Symbol and LED Screen. Exteriors dimensiosn are the same, but accessory behind must fit inside the LED Screen object to be in correct position.<br/>
<br/>
So, it will be great to have possibility to customize LED Screen symbol. <br/>
<br/>
(I try to do had correct 3D geometry in my LED Screen symbol, and after that, it&#39; no more a LED screen symbol...)

These enhancements have also been previously requested by the Novelty Group in France and there are regular forum threads and requests on the entertainment forums particularly in relation to drawing curved LED Walls and Braceworks functionality (how LED walls can be suspended/hung)<br/>
<br/>
Key requests are<br/>
 * make the tool fully symbol based, so that LED/Video walls can be created from manufacturer based symbols, to both streamline the insertion process and make it easier to document the materials needed for video wall planning. This would involve not just the LED panels themselves but also being able to use/insert the specialized rigging and ground support frames routinely used with video walls, where appropriate<br/>
 * Full braceworks functionality for the Video wall objects, symbols and rigging elements,<br/>
 ** Generic LED screen objects need to correctly support rigging and Braceworks features, currently an LED screen object can only be directly attached to a truss or pipe at a single point. This is not realistic and means users have to use workarounds to correctly suspend them and be able to calculate the system with Braceworks<br/>
 *** allow more than a single attachment point to trusses and pipes, typically LED screens have suspension points every half meter to meter<br/>
 *** enable LED screen objects to be suspended directly from hoists and bridles<br/>
 *** be able to use the insert drop command and insert connection tools to connect the LED screen object to structural objects like trusses and pipes that are vertically offset from the the screen object, connecting to the correct suspension points<br/>
 ** Flying/hanging bars symbols for video walls with<br/>
 *** Braceworks enabled with cross section data/profiles (Mo is looking into this)<br/>
 *** The ability to correctly function with all parts of the Braceworks and rigging tools and commands. this means not only being able to connect hoists or attach them to trusses/pipes but being able to use the insert drops command and insert connection command with them as well<br/>
 *** flying bars typically have manufacturer defined suspension points, these need to be taken into account with the symbols and used as the fixed attachment points for hoists, drops etc...<br/>
 * Allow the creation of curved LED walls and screens. Many manufacturers now produce LED panels that have flexible connection angles, to support creating curved screens. <br/>
<br/>
 * Full cable tools functionality, most LED panels have both power and signal inputs and outputs.

One of the requirements is, that space polygons are directly editable for further use in CAFM software. If we don&#39;t support this, Vectorworks will get less points than other software.{color}<br/>

 If the section viewports are refreshed in that process his 64 GB RAM will not be enough and the process stops or geting very slow after about 5-10 Layouts. He said, cloud publishing could handle about 15-20 of his sheet layers. <br/>
 But In every case he need to publish bundles with just a small number of sheet layers. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is not a real bug but in my opinion but it would be nice, if you maybe could take this document to include in your thoughts and tests.<br/>
<br/>
I make the following thoughts:<br/>
 1. The publishing process could maybe be more intelligent and refreshing viewports on  sheet layers after the other sheet layer. After one finished, cache could be cleaned (overwritten) to have enough memory for the next viewports.<br/>
<br/>
2. Maybe it is necessary to have 128 or 256 GB RAM on a client. Maybe this is the best solution. Because we want to have primary best speed and not want to make it slower by saving memory space.<br/>
<br/>
3. As this customer said, cloud publishing is very good for him in all projects. Also the VW Cloud computing seems to have access on more memory than the clients in the office. So maybe it would be a solution to have 256 MB Memory on the Cloud Service for publishing.<br/>
<br/>
Attached a screenshot of his publishing jobs. 10 Sheet layers took about 4 and 10 Minutes. Publishing all sheet layers failed because it did not finished after 24 hours. It is not one sheet layer with an issue. It is the amount of memory usage. Locally and on the Cloud Service.<br/>

3. Fan on the top (as a kind of cuboid on the Rack cover(lid?)) <br/>
4. Export or use of 3D-Racks in the building plan with simplified representation in plan view with show of Rack name, Weight, Power consumption.<br/>

-Rectangles<br/>
-Rounded Rectangles<br/>
-Ovals<br/>
-2D Symbols<br/>

This ability needs to be added to:<br/>
<br/>
-Text objects (!!!)<br/>
-Lines<br/>
-Polygons &amp; Polylines (would use bounding box center)<br/>
-2D/3D Symbols<br/>
-Extrudes &amp; other solids whenever blue handles appear<br/>

Not only would this be useful but it would also make Vectorworks less &quot;inconsistent&quot; which is a common complaint.

Textures should be enabled in the Vectorworks Viewer. It doesn&#39;t need Renderworks Rendering, but OpenGL should at least display textured surfaces.<br/>
<br/>
(I haven&#39;t personally checked on this in the most recent version, but I&#39;m assuming the Viewer still doesn&#39;t support them since I haven&#39;t heard otherwise).<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>

<br/>
([~mrizov]: Changes made to this entry according to our conversation during the GDC in June 2021 as follows)<br/>
Vectorworks should export objects with IFC, even if they are missing a fill, so that they will appear the same in the IFC viewers/model checkers as they appear in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Reasoning: Vectorworks is not an IFC model checker application. Therefore such errors are for those applications to catch.

You can not attach a hoist to a Speaker Array unless you first attach a rigging object eg a short Lighting Pipe to the bumper, which wouldn&#39;t be there in real life. It is not easy using the Manage Loads tool to have the pipe attach to the bumper either. <br/>
<br/>
Once you succeed, you can then use the Insert Connection tool&gt;Insert Drop mode to have a motor attached to the pipe and beam. This only seems to work in 3D as the stacking order affects what can be snapped to (even using X Ray mode).<br/>
<br/>
However the structure is deemed unsupported if connected by only one hoist so you have to have two even if this isn&#39;t the real world situation.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that the Hoist can attach directly to the bumper without the need for another rigging object and that Braceworks understand that some objects, like Speaker Arrays, sometimes only need one hoist. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

<br/>
1) Need some sort of modifier keystroke that helps select a range of vertices, edges, or faces along a path. I select the first edge and then modifier key + arrow left to add the adjacent edge to its left to the selection and so on.<br/>
<br/>
2) Would like to be able to save a selection of vertices, edges, or faces in a way that I can easily grab that selection whenever I need to. Think Groups for SubD parts.<br/>
<br/>
3) Would like to be able to hide a selection of SubD parts temporarily. Clip Cube is too boxy in shape to hide specific parts of an organic shaped SubD model.<br/>
<br/>
4) Speaking of selection, would love to have a dynamic selection tool in the OIP that would allow me to make customizable selection arrays. For example, I select one face and then dynamically select every other face within a designated X/Y array count. This would also be handy for adding vertices across an array selection.<br/>
<br/>
5) Would love to be able to keep the model as a SubD when using Subtraction/Add Solids. Maybe it&#39;s time for VW to have an actual Boolean tool?<br/>
<br/>
6) Can the new texture mapping feature include individual SubD faces? UV mapping in the near future?<br/>
<br/>
7) Not sure how possible this is, but if we had a way to import 3D models that convert to SubD automatically, that would be sooo much nicer than importing a model with hundreds of thousands of polygons.<br/>
<br/>
8. Can we improve the Slice tool so that I select an edge(s) and then have a handle or slider in the OIP that creates additional edges need to round off the edge. Right now, I have to slice one side and then the other...and the slice goes the entire distance of the model rather than where I only want it.

<br/>
Yes, technically this is works as designed and the user may have caused this issue by unknowingly setting a parameter to by style when it should have been left as by instance.  But Bryan G. and Scott L. have determined that there are some plants in our default content that have parameters set to by style instead of instance, and that could easily cause this if added to a document.<br/>
<br/>
We need a way to allow the users to sync the by style/instance setting among all the plant styles to allow for mass modification of plant settings, they were easily able to do this in 2021 and have lost that ability now in 2022.

At present, these objects are set to the &quot;None&quot; class with a default green/brown for the canopy/trunk. If a designer edits the 3D graphics and places these objects on a different class and then goes back in to edit plant style to re-generate the 3D graphics, the objects get reset to default.

These two parts correlate with the large flat surfaces we typically see when in a room, so when texturing we need to know whether we&#39;re looking at the Left or Right side of a wall.<br/>
<br/>
Currently it&#39;s only possible to differentiate which side is the Left vs the Right if you&#39;re in Top/Plan. This is done by looking for the blue arrow near one of the control handles, which indicates the starting point of the wall, and from there you can interpret which side is the Left vs the Right.<br/>
<br/>
However, texturing is typically done in 3D, and this arrow does not appear in 3D. There is currently no way to determine which is the Left vs Right side when looking at a Wall in 3D, so you can resort to trial and error (which is frustrating when you get it wrong) or you can switch to Top/Plan to check, but this interrupts the visual design workflow of your brain.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally one day the Texture tool will work on Walls, but that notwithstanding, it would be incredibly helpful to have an indicator of the Wall direction when viewing it in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
Attached are three images. The first shows an example of looking at a Wall in 3D and having no idea which side is Left vs Right. The second image shows that you can see a direction arrow when in Top/Plan. The third image show a mock-up of adding that same blue arrow in 3D which would fulfill the wish described here.

                                            <td class="description">      BigRig one of the original Beta tester for Braceworks reached out to me last week about a problem they have with how trusses interact with the objects attached to them. <br/>
<br/>
The fundamental issue is that they often have to move trusses a small distance in response to Braceworks calculation results or changes requested by clients/venues but the the hung lights and other load objects hanging from the truss have to remain in their original locations. In 2019 and older it was possible <br/>
<br/>
Currently there is no easy way to move the truss without moving the connected objects. Once they are attached to the truss they will move with it no matter what auto-positioning and class/layer settings are used. selecting and moving the objects back to their original position has to be done manually, which depending on the method used can be error prone or very time consuming or both!<br/>
<br/>
In theory the manage loads tool allows the user to disconnect objects from the truss system but it will only function with one object at a time, not multiple objects.<br/>
<br/>
For BigRig the issue is a major problem due to the size of the productions they are involved with, they often have to manually move several hundred objects back to their original positions due to a small change to the truss positioning.<br/>
<br/>
I can see a couple of ways to approach this as an enhancement<br/>
 # add a context command to truss objects to allow them to move without moving the associated load objects<br/>
 # enhance the manage loads tool so that it can work with multiple selected objects at once<br/>
 # Add a setting in the Spotlight preferences in the loads and rigging pane to allow trusses to move without the attached load objects, maybe with a shortcut key<br/>

<br/>
If one then extrudes that same 2D object into a 3D object, the dimensions no longer associate to the snap points.<br/>
<br/>
If one builds the 3D object first and then adds dimensions, these dimensions do not associate to the snap points.<br/>
<br/>
I propose that the dimensions be able to associate to their respective snap points and function the same as the 2D option. When changing the size of the cube, the dimensions should remain connected to their respective snapped points and these dimensions would change to match.

<br/>
but also an issue I&#39;ve run into repeatedly when using Meshes...<br/>
<br/>
With the rise of photogrammetry along with the general increased presence of imported Mesh objects in Vectorworks files over the last several years, it has become apparent that the software needs to let the user break apart or modify Mesh objects without losing the imported texture mapping.<br/>
<br/>
Since Vectorworks is {*}already importing per-face texture mapping{*}, shouldn&#39;t it be possible to retain that same mapping on each 3D Polygon when the mesh is edited or exploded? (For example: double clicking the mesh to edit its contents, or Converting the Mesh to Group). Currently either of these operations causes the Mesh to become untextured, meaning a user has very little ability to modify imported Meshes to suite the project&#39;s needs. This severely limits the usability of imported Meshes, especially those generated via photogrammetry where additional editing is almost always desired (such as deleting unwanted portions). A user is essentially stuck with Mesh as is, which is very bad for a *design* program.<br/>
<br/>
Another operation that should retain per-face mapping is selecting multiple Meshes and running the &quot;Convert to Mesh&quot; command in order to combine them into one Mesh.<br/>
<br/>
This not only affects imported Meshes from other software such as SketchUp, but also textured Meshes generated by the &quot;Photos to 3D Model&quot; feature of Vectorworks Cloud Services. I&#39;ve had limited success using those generated Meshes since I can&#39;t DO anything with them.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks wants to continue to be the great unifier of cross-platform compatibility, then Mesh editability needs to be addressed.<br/>

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When trying to add Data Tag to Space in the Annotations of Section Viewport, it may be attached to the space figure behind the cut surface.<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1. Create a tall space<br/>
2. 1 and 2 on the back<br/>
3. 3 and 4 on the front<br/>
4. Cut the section viewport at 3 and 4<br/>
5. Create a Section Viewport.<br/>
6. Double-click to enter the Annotations and attach the Data Tag with Spaces.<br/>
7. The Space Number of the Data Tag is displayed as 1 and 2 even though it is cut between 3 and 4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample12555.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie12555.mov&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*The same applies even if &quot;Display extents beyond cut plane&quot; is disabled in Object Info palette.<br/>
<br/>
*Please refer to &quot;original.vwx&quot;<br/>
In Section Viewport &quot;Section Viewport-1&quot;, the information of space numbers 3 and 4 should be displayed in the data tag. However, the information of space numbers 1 and 2 in the back is displayed.<br/>
<br/>
*Depending on the layout position of the space and the position of the cut surface, it may or may not be possible to avoid it by temporarily reversing the direction of Section-Elevation Line or adjusting the range behind the cut surface of Section Viewport.<br/>

Footers must account for reinforcing materials visually and in reports.

                                            <td class="description">      A landscape lighting toolset will allow us to satisfy existing user requests while also open us up to the exterior lighting design market. Many irrigation designers also work in the exterior lighting design market and have mentioned at irrigation shows I&#39;ve attended to let them know when we also have the ability to do exterior lighting design.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The largest US competitor (Land F\X) already has a suite of lighting tools they call the Lighting Manager <br/>
<br/>
[https://www.landfx.com/docs/site-hardscape-design/lighting/item/164-lighting.html |http://example.com/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The proposed toolset should include the following but not be limited to:<br/>
<br/>
*Low Voltage Lighting Fixtures* (sample products [https://www.voltlighting.com/shop/landscape-lighting)] :<br/>
 * Spotlights (ability to point them towards objects like trees, buildings, accent pieces like sculptures)<br/>
 * Path Lights (recognize terrain for &quot;z&quot; height, follow a path and specify spacing between fixtures)<br/>
 * Well Lights<br/>
 * Wall Lights/Step Lights (specify height in wall similar to window sill height, also connect into stair object risers)<br/>
 * Flood Lights<br/>
 * Downlights (signage, moon lighting, down lighting, structure lighting)<br/>
 * Deck Lights/Hardscape Lights (snap into decks/hardscapes and also snap underneath railing)<br/>
 * Underwater Lights (for swimming pools, fountains, ponds, etc.)<br/>
 * Bollard Lights<br/>
 * Specialty Lights (user-defined, sculptural, accent)<br/>
 * Bistro Lights <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Solar Lights* (don&#39;t necessarily require cables and are self-lighting for 4-8 hours a night thanks to solar power throughout the day)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Line Voltage Lighting* - cables that connect to all lights. Ability to define light zones (similar to irrigation design zones)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*A low voltage transformer* is at the heart of every [landscape lighting|https://www.voltlighting.com/shop/landscape-lighting] system. It converts 120 volt current to a low voltage current (between 12-15 VAC). The efficiency of this conversion determines how well the transformer controls the voltage output and how much energy is consumed in the process. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Smart lights* we should also include wifi capable lighting. Really big in the industry right now. Sample products. [https://havenlighting.com/pages/stratus]<br/>

(It&#39;s still an extra moment even if you collect them all after you&#39;ve created a number of them and then assign them in one go). Normally you only have one site model in a file - the few times you have two on top of each other - rooftop garden with undulating surface - you can manually select what site model they should interact with)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there has to be a &#39;none&#39; alternative (unassigned, the default at the moment) - sometimes you have to just add a LA with a z value different to the site model (for raised planters, rooftops without a second site model etc.).<br/>

If you have to change any contours/levels/site modifiers post LA creations you have to either disconnect the LA fully from the site model layer and disconnect the site model from the LA layer, and then re-connect it OR you have to do a reset of all plugins.<br/>
<br/>
The cut of the LA is following the changes and is reflected in the C&amp;F, so the connections is sort of there, it&#39;s just the components and the plants that doesn&#39;t follow.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a sustainable workflow. You can have hundreds of LAs in a file. The time it takes for the recalculations of these things is immense - it can range from a minute for one single LA to  10/20/30 minutes for more complicated ones.<br/>
<br/>
The vwx file I&#39;ve attached is the demo file we&#39;ve been working on - this is a small project and I&#39;ve spent hours waiting on updates. Imagine a new housing estate. Play with it and see how long to&#39;ll take to update the LAs if you have to raise the level of the site with 100mm.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that follows site model level changes is the texture bed - this follows the site model, independent of if it&#39;s applied to existing or proposed site model.

Today, you have to go into edit to see what plants or components are included. This is cumbersome if you have a dozen or more LAs in a project and are looking for one specific.<br/>

<br/>
Even if you&#39;d place the plants so they spill over in real life, this sometimes doesn&#39;t work for models. The screenshot shows what&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
This is not an issue unless the plants extrude into/through other objects, as here, but it would be good to have the option to ensure they &#39;paint inside the lines&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
This could be a tick box on the tab for graphics, saying &#39;keep plants fully inside planting bed edge&#39; (unless the suggested changes to the UI are going through). See screenshot.

<br/>
Gates would need to have panel settings that allow their appearance to match other regular panels or the gate could have unique settings. Gates would also have adjustable height and swing settings. in 3D views they could appear as open and a percentage could be set, lust like regular doors. Custom symbols could be used for gates, also like regular doors.<br/>

 # if a user tries to &quot;close&quot; a site modifier when using &quot;contour mode&quot;, prompt a dialog (the first time they try with the option to not show again) to convert to pad, and that a pad will act as a closed contour<br/>

In practice and in dealing with paths and roads, my experience has been that _most_ designers and consultants refer to the Longitudinal Profile as &quot;Center Line&quot; and the Transverse Profile simply as &quot;Profile&quot; or perhaps &quot;Cross Profile&quot;. Only the most mathematically- or scientifically-minded professionals use the terms Longitudinal Profile and Transverse Profile.<br/>

In an effort to be more user friendly, I would just ask that it be considered to rename the two current terms to &quot;Centerline&quot; and &quot;Profile&quot;.<br/>

The current workaround is to either turn off the mesh but then you will see holes where there are no surfaces, or set the datum to the bottom of the top component which can result in grading issues.<br/>

<br/>
I have been looking at the Path mode of the new Site Modifier. It&#39;s great! I love that it can be reshaped, love the concept of the profiles and being able to edit them. However, as I used it, I had some thoughts on how it could be improved:<br/>
 * The annotation of the Longitudinal Profile should be visible on the drawing (as long as the user selects this). The values should not just be visible in edit mode. We can see the end elevations, but we can&#39;t see the slope annotation. Currently, only the start and end elevation are displayed.<br/>
 * The Slope Rise/Run value should not just show the result. In the attached example, the path is 10m long, and has a rise/run of 1:100. To enter the end elevation, I had to calculate this myself. Once the end elevation had been set, the Rise/Run value of 0.01 is displayed. But a designer would really want to see 1:100 on the annotation. It would also be useful to see the surface length as an option. In fact, it would be nice if the annotation options were the same as for the Grade tool. <br/>
 * With the current iteration of the tool, the designer can use the tool to snap to existing modifiers, or they must enter specific values for the start and end elevation. It would be nice if the start or end elevation could be calculated - and have the same options as the Grade tool. The designer could enter one elevation, and then choose Percentage, Rise/Run or Angle, and Vectorworks would calculate the other elevation. The user would then have the option to display these values on the path - not just when editing.

At the moment, if you put in the same number for top and bottom diameter, the root ball doesn&#39;t appear. It would be good to be able to put in the same number, especially as a B&amp;B root ball often is shaped like a - ball (no pun intended...) and a cylinder would be a better representation of it.

I&#39;ve attached screenshots of their emails for reference but here is what they say:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Surface 678 (Phillip Tripp):*<br/>
<br/>
One more item comes to mind that would benefit us greatly would be the ability to run footcandle photometric studies of lighting on our ground plane.  We typically rely on lighting distributor reps, manufacturer reps, or electrical engineers to run these diagram studies for us and that typically never happens quickly, and soon they become less inclined to do them after the client changes their mind several times.  Usually the IES lighting files are available for free from lighting companies, but I&#39;m not aware that Landmark can use them for that photometric study purpose.  I think your theatrical lighting software can use those files.<br/>
<br/>
I should add that if this is something Vectorworks is considering, there are specific building code requirements lighting must conform to, so typically these studies have a polygon that defines an area of footcandles to allow data calculation of the min, max, average, and ratio of footcandles for that area.  We then have the ability to position lights and run compliance studies on various layout options without involving a slow consultant.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Michael Cholona:*<br/>
<br/>
Can I do site photometric design for parking lots in VW? Be able to use ies light fixture files to generate the footcandle light grids?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For our Landmark customers, these studies typically need to be done for Parking Lots, Athletic &amp; Sports Fields, Sign Lighting, Security Lighting, Landscape &amp; Outdoor Lighting, Decorative Pole Lighting, etc. I know we have the ability to import IES files into light objects but it seems to stop there. I&#39;m attaching various images for reference.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Scenarios include but are not limited to:<br/>
 * hardscapes within hardscapes for complex design<br/>
 * tree pits<br/>
 * lights in hardscape<br/>
 * drains inside hardscape (different than are slab drainage which does not work for site design requirements)<br/>
 * placing bioretention planters in hardscape<br/>

In the case of many styles with components in Landmark, these two options offer a great disadvantage to effective and proper design of the site. I am proposing an offsite value from the top or bottom datum setting. Example: 4&quot; of concrete as of now will be st to grade to the top or bottom of the concrete. However, often concrete(surface ) needs to be set 1&quot; above grade for proper design when it meets to turf, or plant bed. This will set grade datum to the preferred offset shifting the surface of the hardscape up one inch as desired. This will also eliminate z-fighting with the model.<br/>

Also check enhancement (VE-102247) in regards to all hardscape elevations should be set by top of top component. Not Datum.

I first created the steps, then manually added a 3D poly along the inner corner of the treads. Then, I offset it to half the height of the riser, and adjusted it at top and bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Then the normal - DTM-class and adding to the site model.<br/>
<br/>
This is very laborious (and here I haven&#39;t even created a bottom pad for the steps, only the upper edge). If we could use the fit to object for these situations, we could save so much time.<br/>
<br/>
However, the created site modifiers must be editable - to have the soil to come to either the top of the stairs OR the bottom of the raft would be totally useless. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible to create a tool which is precise enough to use in real situations without tweaking. This is a theme which comes up in all parametric tools - they are good at what they&#39;re doing, but not good enough to cater for precise design. We must be able to adjust the results, otherwise it just becomes clunky.

<br/>
I have received the following request from a customer via a private message on the forum. <br/>
<br/>
She has set up specific mixes, but is finding that some areas are too small for some plants to register so show as 0 in the count. She ALWAYS wants a minimum number of plants.<br/>
<br/>
She makes a good point. She&#39;s got around her issue (areas being too small for certain plants to be included) but adding areas together. However, she has asked for the ability for plants to have a minimum number specified as well as the rate/percentage.<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_Hi Tamsin_{color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_We&#39;re a landscape architecture firm in NZ, using VW across our team. In recent weeks we&#39;ve been testing VW landscape areas pretty hard, and have resolved a number of ways to achieve what we need, but still need help. Our browsing of the forum sees you as the expert, so I thought I&#39;d message directly! Hope that&#39;s ok!_{color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_So, we have a site that is 3km long (a road). It has roughly 400 landscape areas, all of various shapes (from 1m2 to 100m2). We then have 3 base planting mixes (or landscape styles), &#39;Narrow&#39;, &#39;Medium&#39; and &#39;Wide&#39; that we can apply based on the width and location of the planting area._ {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_The benefit of three landscape styles is that we can work quickly - obviously we don&#39;t want to individually assign a different mix to over 400 planting beds, it would take too long (to do, and also to change when the inevitable revisions come). However, we are finding that if you have a small landscape area (say 1m2), then there is not space in the landscape area for all the plants in the mix. As a result, the tag comes up with lots of zero&#39;s in it - but worse, we get a plant area that might have 15 plants in it but only one of each plant. It&#39;s not how we want the mixes to work._ {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_Therefore, our first workaround was to join landscape areas together. We found a way to do this using a polyline joining a series of polygons, combined into a surface, and then converted to a landscape area. It requires a little adjustment to get right, but essentially it means we can have several landscape areas joined with a line, with only one tag for all three._ {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_However, we&#39;re still wondering if we can be smarter? Could it be possible, for example, to set a minimum number of plants per style? Eg, we say Plant-A should be 5% of the mix, but there needs to be at least 5 of them in a landscape area._ {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_The spacing of all the plants is the same in each mix, so theoretically once the area of is known, the number of plants is known._ {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#0747a6}_Any thoughts? Complex issue we know!_{color}<br/>
<br/>

/.../<br/>
The reports (that geotechnical engineers produce) do not seem to come in a tabular form. They seem to be traditionally created in a page per soil boring type scenario.<br/>
<br/>
For a site with 20 borings, there would be 20 individual boring report pages. For a designer to create survey points in Vectorworks, they would have to enter them all manually (recognizing layers which may not be found in each boring because the tool requires them to do so).<br/>
They would have to assemble the table (worksheet/spreadsheet) first, then get it into the proper import format, then import to see the points placed and changing the existing layers of soil under the surface.<br/>
<br/>
The other option would be to place the survey points manually in Vectorworks, again trying to remember all of the layers included throughout the site that may not be included in each boring report page. (Again, not very easy.)

I realise that each jurisdiction has local requirements and will have different plant libraries. However some libraries are shared and this VE is a suggestion to merge the &#39;BIM Plants (UK Metric)&#39; file - which is the only file in the folder called &#39;Concept Plants BIM&#39; - into the folder called &#39;Concept Plants 3D&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
The &#39;BIM Plants (UK Metric)&#39; file needs to be &#39;Saved as&#39; and renamed &#39;Trees&#39; and placed into that folder.<br/>
<br/>
All Plant objects appear to have the &#39;IfcBuildingElementProxy&#39; record with the Name, Object Type and Tag already attached as well as the &#39;Material&#39; record with Component 1 filled out as Plant Material. <br/>
<br/>
The symbols in the &#39;Concept 3D folder&#39; and &#39;Concept Plants BIM&#39; are no different in this matter. This move would get rid of the unnecessary &#39;Concept Plants BIM&#39; folder that adds one more level of confusion for the average user. As there already is a &#39;Concept Plants 2D&#39; folder it is more logical to keep the &#39;Concept Plants 3D&#39; as opposed to the &#39;Concept Plants BIM&#39; one.<br/>
<br/>
This would tidy up unnecessary duplication and confusion for users.<br/>
<br/>
Snapshot enclosed.<br/>

Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
1)  Make the offset have no effect on the size of the fence preview.<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
2)  Add a reference line to the fence preview so when you adjust the offset, you can see and visualize the shift.

<br/>
A complication arises with a combination of aligned Hardscape objects and the way the Site Model surface interacts with them.<br/>
<br/>
This is the when the datum is set to the (first) component top.<br/>
<br/>
!DatumSetToComponentTop.PNG|width=438,height=246!<br/>
<br/>
This is the model when the datum is set to the (first) component bottom.<br/>
<br/>
!DatumSetToComponentBottom.PNG|width=441,height=247,thumbnail!<br/>
<br/>
The User expects the Site Model to align to the bottom of a component. <br/>
 In other words - the User wants to be able to expose a positive edge around the perimeter of the top (finished surface) component of the Hardscape. ie; we shouldn&#39;t assume the Site Model should always be resolved flush with the top of the Hardscape. <br/>
 [If the datum controls the height of the Hardscape and is not coupled to the Site Model surface alignment, maybe we need another control to &#39;lift the hardscape out of the ground&#39; or an &#39;offset from Site Model surface&#39;?]<br/>
<br/>
VB-183220: Bozhidar Stanchev &quot;It is a good point. The Datum is not coupled to the Site Model surface alignment. That is a good idea to have another control that allows to offset the Hardscape to the Site Model surface. (i.e. the modifier that the Hardscape prepares/provides for the Site Model to not only follow its finished surface, but to be offsetable relative to the Top or Bottom).&quot;

A few additional controls would accommodate those requirements and probably those of other countries too.<br/>
Suggested changes and enhancements;<br/>
1. An option to have an &#39;aisle&#39; across the open end of the parking bay and associated side aisles.<br/>
2. An aisle option for &#39;left AND right shared sides of an accessible parking space<br/>
3. The default height for the international symbol for accessible parking should be easily set to a national standard, the default symbol is 1829mm high and in the UK it should be 1400mm high. A UK version of VW would benefit from this &#39;out of the box&#39; or have the ability to select a preconfigured symbol appropriate for different countries where the standards differ.<br/>
4. Accessible symbol is located very close to the parking space numbers, it would be beneficial to have some control over the location of the symbol and parking space numbers, possibly by offset from default location.

<br/>
If we are able to support these use cases by using the Data Tag, we could retire the Add Text to Database function.<br/>
<br/>
I created separate Enhancement Requests for the use cases where the Data Tag should be better supported to retire Add Text to Database:<br/>

*Support of Block Attributes in DWG Export*<br/>

https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-102178<br/>

<br/>
It is also really terrific that the Hanging Position object now will roll with 2D Components also in place. These also report well to Schematic Views. Really good.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment if I use a 2d/3d Hybrid symbol as a Hanging Position, the 2D Left and Right, Front and Back components of the Symbol are not utilized by a Schematic View. This would seem inconsistent with the same reporting of the 2D components of Lighting Instrument Symbols within Lighting Devices.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
As per [this thread in the Distributor Forum|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/90469-t02271-shaded-rendering-improvements/#comment-414254] in the new improvements for Shaded rendering in v2023.<br/>
<br/>
If these improvements eventuate for Shaded renders, users will want to quickly explore different types of lighting on the model immediately. Currently the only way to save lighting set ups and combinations for a scene is via the Visualisation Palette for individual viewports. <br/>
<br/>
The wish is the ability for users to be able to save lighting set ups via Saved Views. That would allow all types of designers across all industries immediate display of lighting ideas as they navigate the model in the design layer environment.<br/>
<br/>
This task will open up a world of discovery to designers as they communicate their designs to clients. Interior designers and architects, exhibition and set designers in particular will want to quickly go from one combination of lighting to another. <br/>
<br/>
It is important for designers to stay in Vectorworks and not have to use another program to show lighting effects and combinations. Vectorworks would remain as the main communication tool. For example, in film production Rhino has been eating into the Vectorworks market for production design with external renderers and to have this ability built into Vectorworks would add to our bow. <br/>

<br/>
Attached is an example of Graphic Legend criteria, where I&#39;ve had to manually identify external doors by IDSuffix. But this is prone to error because if somebody adds an external door to the model they need to remember to update the Graphic Legend criteria to include it.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a standard and highly visible way to identify doors as being external then this error could be avoided. It could also mean that any external door styles that are duplicated to create a new one would also be identified as external by default (a desirable behaviour).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps as simple as a check button in the _Door Style &gt; General_ dialogue window?

This is partly because wall closures necessarily have a complex relationship with walls but I think the main problem was that Plug-in Options are tucked away in a contextual menu. And many of the problems I see people having with wall closures (and plug-in object offsets) also relate to the discoverability of Plug-in Options. I&#39;ve even heard/seen people say they haven&#39;t seen the Plug-in Options window before.<br/>
<br/>
Plug-in Options are quite a bit more important now that they include wall insertion and wall closure options, equally important as Settings.<br/>
<br/>
So I think there&#39;s a simple fix for this: every single plug-in object should have a &quot;Plug-in Options...&quot; button in the object Info palette. And if the plug-in has a Style dropdown menu in the OIP, that also needs a &quot;Edit Style Plug-in Options...&quot; option.<br/>
<br/>
Examples of people having problems due to this lack of discoverability :<br/>

These customers want to avoid having to ask assistants and colleagues to purchase fonts that they require. They would rather prefer to embed the fonts within the file so as part of the file - open process the required font is either downloaded or unzipped as part of the file.

Here in the US, two-fers often have tales ranging in length from 12 inches to 36 inches. Inserting a two-fer between two lights that are 24 inches apart does not need any jumpers added. Currently, adding a two-fer distributor object between two lights and then using the cable tool to circuit these two lights results in extra jumper cables being added.<br/>
 <br/>
Considering the above, solving the issue can be accomplished in different ways.<br/>
1. Creating different twofer distributor symbols each with their predefined length of tales.<br/>
2. Adding the ability to allow users to specify the length of the tails.<br/>
 <br/>
Similar to the breakout objects from 2021 having a length be assignable to each output, a twofer, or three for, etc. should allow the same functionality. This differs from using a plug box which would require a jumper in most cases. With the exception of lights that are located nearby a plug box where the pigtail of the light itself is within reach to said plug box.

                                            <td class="description">      When running cables/circuits out to a row of lights on a pipe or truss, it is often desirable to quickly add a two-fer between lights along the way. When running cables using the old cable tools, one could hold down a modifier key that would assign the same circuit number two multiple lights. After releasing the modifier key, the sequential circuit numbering would continue.<br/>
 <br/>
The attached video shows how I can quickly circuit a truss run of various lights into a single six-circuit multi-cable.<br/>
 <br/>
Process steps towards offering multiple lighting units and circuiting them to a multi-cable distributor object.<br/>
 <br/>
Activate a jumper insertion tool.<br/>
 <br/>
Select the distributor output (circuit box, breakout, etc.) as the starting object.<br/>
 <br/>
Click on the lighting units that you wish to circuit. The first lighting unit would obtain the first circuit number from the distributor object and insert it into the circuit field of the lighting device object.<br/>
 <br/>
To two-fer the second lighting unit to the first, hold down a modifier key such as Command and click on the second lighting unit. Holding down the command key would insert the circuit number from the previously chosen lighting unit to be the same. This number gets inserted into the currently selected lighting symbol circuit name/number fields.<br/>
 <br/>
Should you wish to two-fer/three-fer the next unit with these prior units, you will keep holding down the Command key while clicking on additional units.<br/>
 <br/>
Releasing the Command key and clicking on the next lighting unit will use the next available circuit number from the distributor object. In this example, it would be circuit #2.<br/>
 <br/>
Should the user wish to two-fer more units, they would press the Command key for each desired instance.<br/>
 <br/>
This process will continue until the user clicks in an empty area, which ends the circuiting command. Or the process would end once the user runs out of usable circuits as defined by the distributor object. For example, if the distributor has only six circuits, the tool would automatically end once the user reaches a point whereby a seventh circuit would be needed.<br/>
 <br/>
During this circuit assignments, each lighting unit should receive the following information from the distributor object to which they are being circuited:<br/>
Circuit number into the circuit number field.<br/>
Circuit name (cable ID) into the circuit name field.<br/>
Dimmer number (obtained from the distributor from which power is supplied to the cable run) is inserted into the dimmer field.<br/>
The jumper cable length used from the breakout distributor to the lighting unit should be inserted into the cable field.<br/>
 <br/>
During the circuit assignments, the multi-cable distributor, or the multi-cable itself, should receive the following information.<br/>
Each circuit number should show which lighting units are assigned to the said circuit. If units are two-ferred together, these fields will receive multiple unit numbers. (See screenshot.) Note the Prefix of &quot;Unit&quot; followed by unit numbers separate by commas.<br/>
 <br/>
Jumper cables that are inserted into the drawing using the above process should receive the following information:<br/>
Cable run ID followed by a colon, followed by the circuit number to which it is assigned.<br/>
Loom ID if present.<br/>
The unit number from the lighting unit is assigned.<br/>
Jumper cable ID numbers could also follow a 1.1, 1.2 type of number system.

This has come back as WAD. <br/>
&quot;Only dimension, area, volume, and angle fields can have custom formatting in the Data Tag. Those forces fields are just plain real fields.&quot;<br/>

This VE is for there to be a formatted option when creating Data Tags so that the forces can be rounded off. Looking at the enclosed snapshot showing 8 decimal places it looks somewhat ridiculous.<br/>

Currently the Connect/Combine tool only works with polylines, polygons, lines, Roof Faces and NURBS.<br/>

Often architects need to model rafters and other solid objects and NURBS aren&#39;t the best objects for this. The wish is that this tool&#39;s functions be updated to include 3D Solids like extrudes. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise to miter rafters joining to others is tricky, using the Project tool, or extending the solids through and using the split tool etc. These options feel like workarounds whereas the Connect/Combine tool promises so much yet it&#39;s functionality is limited to those few 3D objects. It would make all 3D modelling much easier if this was possible for it to work with other 3D objects like extrudes.<br/>

Sorry to butt in not minding my own business and this is obviously a work in progress but I have some wishes about this document. <br/>
<br/>
I have included a small text file with some comments (I know no one has asked me but I have done it anyway). Here&#39;s a summary:<br/>
<br/>
+Internet Activation:+<br/>
Serial numbers dialog location is not explicit and users need to know it&#39;s in the Vectorworks Prefs.<br/>
<br/>
+Installation Instructions+<br/>
The software (implying Vectorworks) is not downloaded. It is the Vectorworks installer. So many users say they &#39;downloaded&#39; the program when they mean they installed it and getting it right here would help correct that.<br/>
<br/>
+Installation Q &amp; A+<br/>
It is called the macOS and macOS 11 needs to be added.<br/>
<br/>
+Will my existing Vectorworks be overwritten?+<br/>
It should be emphatic and &#39;that is&#39; (i.e) rather than &#39;for example (eg).<br/>
<br/>
+Vectorworks 2022 System Requirements+<br/>
Surely macOS 11 (Big Sur) should be added?<br/>
<br/>
+Hardware Requirements for Project Sharing Server +<br/>
Surely macOS 11 (Big Sur) should be added?<br/>
<br/>
+Network Requirements for Project Sharing and Cloud Sharing +<br/>
The Vectorworks Cloud Services can now use delta synching for files over 200mb and is also recommended?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned I realise this is a work in progress and I don&#39;t wish to teach anyone how to suck eggs (is that an expression used in the USA?!) but I felt I had to make a comment on these things so it is really clear to users. I have noticed some omissions regarding Big Sur in the 2021 read me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It&#39;s been like this forever, but now with the new Attributes palette the hardwired imperial measurements for the default marker types for length and width really are unacceptable when viewed in the metric world.<br/>
<br/>
The default lengths might make sense at 1/8th of an inch bit when viewed in the metric world, 3.175mm makes no sense at all.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion as 3.175 is invariably always too small I would suggest all lengths default to 5mm. I&#39;ve been meaning to do a VE on this since 1996 when I first used Minicad 6!<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
The wish is that there is a dedicated structural member tool for Spotlight and Braceworks. Currently the structural member tool borrowed from Architect allows bridles and hoists to be attached but that’s all and is not part of any calculation. In fact there is +nothing structural+ about the Structural Member tool! <br/>
<br/>
Spotlight users do not need all the various architectural features of the Structural Member tool, but they need a more processor efficient and dedicated one. This is because they need the ability to perform Braceworks calculations on the rigging beams themselves. The beams need to be considered Braceworks trusses for this to occur. The reason for this VE is that the current process of customising trusses is extremely difficult and not properly supported.<br/>
<br/>
This tool could be similar to the Architect Framing Member tool that at least allows users to draw all kinds of styles and shapes of beams found in new and old venues. These other types of customised beams should then allow the user to add customised cross section data more easily than now. Or, just to be included in a file for visual accuracy even if not included in the calculations (see enclosed screenshot with webbed beam drawn by the Framing Member tool).<br/>
<br/>
With the current Structural Member tool, when choosing the Steel Section option, users can select the &#39;Structural Shape&#39; which accesses the libraries used by the individual steel section tools in the Detailer toolset - such as the I-Beam, Wide Flange, Channel, Tubing, Tee etc. All these plugged in steel sections are drawn from externally available lists including AISC, BSI, JIS, ANZ, DIN and others. <br/>
<br/>
In real life these sections would have to comply to a list dictating their minimum strength values. The wish also is that these values of force limitations for each type of section are also carried into the new PIO for each structural shape. Plugging in this readily available information would then allow Braceworks calculations to be immediately carried out for every type of &#39;Structural Shape&#39; in the tool... and avoid custom trusses.<br/>
<br/>
The current workaround for custom trusses is:<br/>
* Place the 3D object on the page<br/>
* Turn it into a Symbol<br/>
* Use Convert (symbol) to Truss command<br/>
* Right click&gt;Customise Truss Symbol Data<br/>
* Edit the Truss Properties (enter data)<br/>
* Change Cross Section (enter data)<br/>
<br/>
It is in this last dialogue ‘Change Cross Section’ that users really have to contend with. They have to make a ‘Custom’ set and enter the force limitation data if available. However there are many unknowns with little - if any - documentation. For example if users want the graphic Workload to be shown they have to specify in the ‘Design’ field a choice between Generic, Pipe, 4/3/2 Tubes. Pipe seems to be the only one that shows the workload graphic. This is very obscure and might also depend (although not tested) on whether in the Braceworks Preferences the workload shown is either:<br/>
<br/>
* Absolute Workload<br/>
* Relative Workload<br/>
* Threshold, <br/>
* And the other 6 force influences. <br/>
<br/>
Users are flying blind here. Once a custom truss is set up, alarmingly there is no way to transfer this to another file. Even if the Custom Truss object is saved as a Red Symbol, whether imported or copied into another file, the custom Cross Section information does not come across and has to be re-inputted again which is highly tedious. It shows that custom trusses are not really supported as a workflow which they need to be if rigging beams are to be included in Braceworks calculations.<br/>
<br/>
This request was sparked by working with a user who is one of the main authors of the authoritative _“International Code of Practise for Entertainment Rigging”._ His company has won the contract for a new venue in Melbourne that is still being built but he is finding that it is very difficult to get Braceworks to work as he would wish.<br/>
<br/>
A dedicated Structural Member tool is needed by users, maybe similar to the Framing Member tool - one that has the cross section data for all structural shape libraries already plugged in, and one that easily and more intuitively allows users to customise and share custom trusses if need be.<br/>
<br/>
It is almost universal for separate beams to share the same node which is rated by a structural engineer. Getting this to work in Braceworks means splitting the node using House Rigging Points into two and halving the allowable Z force for each. This workaround isn&#39;t what really happens for that single node. I am hoping this could be addressed with a new tool.<br/>

It is common not to import one Shape file at a time but rather dozens at once. In the enclosed movie you can see a typical dataset with 16 Shape files. As you can see I have selected them all at once and dragged onto the page.<br/>
<br/>
Some take seconds to import, some 30mins or much more depending on the data (at least in my case with the City of Sydney dataset). <br/>
<br/>
As each Shape file imports, the Import Shape file dialogue appears and asks if you want to use the Documents Georerencing set up or the Shapefiles&#39; co-ordinate system among other things. It is almost certain that it will be one or the other that is suitable for the entire process.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that there is an &quot;Always Do this action for all imports during this operation&quot; button, but just for that particular operation so next session or file you get the dialogue back. Actually it would be good to have that when importing images...<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, users have to wait for each and every Shape file to import, and it can take several hours. Each time a file is imported the user has to be there and watch in order to dismiss the dialogue which is very tedious as it should be a continual process.<br/>

Spotlight: Dangerous bug with the Align and Distribute tool changing and reversing the order of instruments depending on which direction the alignment line is drawn. <br/>
<br/>
 The order must never change! Just Align and Distribute or whatever option chosen, but the order as said by [Mark on the beta forum|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/85536-a-question-for-spotlight-users-about-the-align-and-distribute-tool/&amp;tab=comments#comment-401182] is &#39;sacred&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
This VE is to ask that the tool behaves the same way when used left to right and right to left, that when used vertically up the page from top to bottom and bottom to top the order doesn&#39;t change.<br/>
<br/>
Currently it only seems to work when used left to right. The VE is for any direction the Align and Distribute tool is used that the order is *preserved*.<br/>
<br/>
I have had complaints about this and if not noticed by the user then this could be disastrous and affect the reputation of the program.<br/>

Now that the OpenGL rendering mode is renamed &#39;Shaded&#39; because OpenGL is on it&#39;s way out, users will expect to see shadows. Currently shadows is off by default as it has been for many versions. The wish is to have shadows enabled by default.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of users would wish to render seeing shadows especially not least because it is called &#39;Shaded&#39;. It will disappoint many new users when they use it for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
It is probably off for performance reasons but these days most users have decent GPUs to handle this. If users don&#39;t, then they can turn off the shadows option. <br/>

If you use the Publish command and use the Vectorworks Cloud Services to process and store the documents the dialogue that comes up does not allow the user to change the document&#39;s name. Instead users get the confusing notice that they are about to over write some files (even if they are looking at an empty folder). This is a bad user experience and still makes me feel uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that a normal Save dialogue come up instead which users would be familiar with and then able to manage and importantly name the published document(s) what they want rather than the Publish command use the name of the Vectorworks file that it seems to do automatically. <br/>
<br/>
There is no way for a user to have different versions without going into the folder first and renaming the previously published document something else otherwise it will be over written. It is common to keep different versions and to manage at the point of creation rather than having to go backwards and rename. It doesn&#39;t seem logical nor user friendly without a normal save dialogue.<br/>

Place some truss objects on the page. Go to a side view and select. Note that if you change the roll angle in the OIP the truss changes position and moves whereas it should stay where placed and only roll. This rotation should be at the centre of the truss. <br/>
<br/>
Currently it is the Insertion point that the truss rotates and this is incorrect. Users would only want it to rotate about it&#39;s centre and not from a technical part of the symbol.<br/>

If you have Seating Section (SS) and want to place an aisle using the Split method, you draw a line across the SS and move the cursor by it&#39;s width to make a rectangular shape. Most aisles would be a fixed width but the length would vary according to the size of the SS.<br/>

The wish is to enable the new Snapping group be able to be dragged along the bottom strip that they reside in. Currently they are locked to the right. If users are to be denied the previous floating palette which is fine, then they need at least have the flexibility to drag the group to the left or centre along the bottom strip.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the macOS (not using dark mode) it is difficult if nigh impossible to know if a snap is on or off. The indication needs to be more obvious. I had to draw a rectangle and see if Snap to Object was on because I couldn&#39;t tell looking at the icons so I wish this indication was more obvious.<br/>

I have come across several users who seem to think that they are on the latest version of Vectorworks because they have run the &#39;Check for Updates&#39; either in the menu command or from the splash screen. When they reach the last service pack it will always tell them that they are up to date.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion is to make it more explicit so that those less technically aware or those who ignore emails about new versions being released, that the wording be changed to perhaps:<br/>
&quot;Check for updates for this Version&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I realise this is quite trivial but mention it as I have come across some confused users.<br/>

In theatre it is common to project onto the floor. This is usually done in the theatre with the projector rigged normally and the images diverted by a mirror 90º.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to draw this in Vectorworks using the Video Screen tool you tilt the projector 90º so that in 3D the projector is now parallel to the screen which is how it actually is. <br/>
<br/>
However because the tool is hybrid users are unable to go to a side view and rotate the whole unit 90º so that the screen is on the floor. Either you ungroup it and lose all the intelligence or you place the tool on it&#39;s own layer and create a design layer viewport of it so that it can be rotated in the model.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that like some other objects and tools, notably the Curved Truss and Truss objects, that there is an option for the Video Screen tool to &#39;Draw 3D only&#39; so that users can just get on with it and set up the projector and screen in the way they want and then be able to freely orientate within the design.<br/>

The wish is that House Rigging Points are styled. This is so that once some have been placed on a drawing, users can easily edit the layout via Style settings. In the enclosed file with 455 House Rigging Points, there is no easy way to move the labels into position so that they are all readable. <br/>
<br/>
It is not possible moving the labels all at once using the Selection tool - even in &#39;Unrestricted Interactive Scaling mode&#39;. It would also be handy to be able to rescale the symbol, as unlike Hoist symbols which can be rescaled in the OIP, House Rigging Points are more crude and so the symbol instance has to be scaled.<br/>
<br/>
If styled, then they could all be edited at once so that the plan was instantly readable once placed. If any needed separate editing then they could be done as individual ones.<br/>

Reliability and quality are the backbone of Vectorworks’ reputation. However a continuing weakness is when Vectorworks files that have been converted over many versions often display sometimes unrepeatable and unexplained problems. <br/>
<br/>
For example today a file that has a DTM and has been converted over time from v12.5 disappears when surface sculpting and an erroneous message comes up about needing to have the legacy Unified View turned on.<br/>
<br/>
However if the DTM was imported using the Layer Import option into a blank 2022 file then it works perfectly. Since 2021 SP3, users can now also copy and paste sheet layer viewports between files. However Design layer viewports do not carry across. <br/>
<br/>
The wish is that Vectorworks sees what version the file originated in, and that at a certain threshold (pre Parasolid 2011 perhaps?) it uses a form of Layer Import that copies everything across into a virgin blank 2022 file. Referenced Design Layer viewports would have to delete the reference but keep the geometry in the file.<br/>
<br/>
This option might come up only after a file has already been converted the usual way (say using the Batch Convert command) but when the user opens the file. “Do you want to open as is, or convert again into a brand new file for more reliable results?”<br/>
<br/>
As we see some users with templates that originated many versions ago, maybe if templates are migrated they could also just be converted this layer import way. This is just a thought to lessen the cause for users to blame Vectorworks for erratic behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

This wish is to address a macOS problem. The wish is that there is an option to include any un-docked palettes within one of the Smart Options&#39; four compass points. <br/>
<br/>
Un-docked Palettes, in particular ones like the Resource Manager and Visualisation palette spring to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Windows where the Resource Manager (RM) can be placed (scrolled up) right high up at the very top of the computer window, on the macOS it has to reside within the Vectorworks drawing environment. It gets very annoying as it often get&#39;s in the way in particular when on a laptop. <br/>
<br/>
Hitting the space bar to access the Smart Option Display, the palettes would be more efficient than CMD-R because the focus on the keyboard at the time might be on doing something else such as when editing.<br/>
<br/>
Also while I&#39;m here, I understand why for discoverability reasons the Smart Option Display preference &#39;Show after Mouse Idles&#39; after 10 seconds is set. However the appearance of the Smart Options Display constantly popping up often gets in the way and I am sure adds a level of confusion and complexity to a lot of users. Maybe for discoverability the timing might be extended to 20 seconds?<br/>

<br/>
When selecting a hanging position, the OIP offers a button, &quot;Change Trim Height of System,&quot; which only makes changes to truss objects inside the hanging position container. Multiple posts on our forums indicate that many users need clarification on this. When activating the tool and assigning a new height value, the rigging objects inside said hanging positions are moved but the Z height value in the OIP remains unchanged. Thereby confusing.<br/>
<br/>
We should add an option to move the Hanging Position to the drop-down options in the Change Trim Height dialog box. See attached.<br/>
<br/>
If one chooses this new Hanging Position option, the tool should change the Z height value of the hanging position itself, and everything attached should follow. The user may have to reconnect any attached hoists.

You can define the distance between the lower hook and the load.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good if you could also define the distance between the upper hook and the rigging object.<br/>

At the moment the upper hook is always pulled into the center of the truss. In reality, however, this is not always the case.<br/>

Also other softwares have better MEP tools like Archicad or Revit. I think development of the MEP toolset is crucial on all BIM workflows.

<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/81544-is-it-possible-to-disable-certain-rm-libraries/]<br/>
<br/>
In the left pane of the Resource Manager, I want to be able right click on a library file, or folder, and have the option to &quot;Disable&quot; the file(s).<br/>
<br/>
This would mean that the contents of disabled files would not show up in Search results.<br/>
<br/>
There are some libraries that produce dozens and dozens of search results that I&#39;ll never use, and simply get in the way. I&#39;d love to simply turn those library files off somehow.<br/>
<br/>
In the old version of the Resource Browser, you could simply delete files off your hard drive, but this isn&#39;t possible now that everything is cloud-based. Plus, disabling a library would allow you to later re-enable the library if needed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note that this is different than turning off the entire Vectorworks or Premium Libraries categories... It needs to be per file.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Disabled libraries would display as grayed out in the file list to distinguish them.

                                            <td class="description">      The current workflow for creating distribution objects for the new Spotlight cable and power planning tools-suite is complex and slow. The user has to manually add all the electrical components to the 3D component of the model and then configure them<br/>
<br/>
Major issues with this workflow include<br/>
 * Can’t configure the properties of the component before insertion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Components are 2D/3D hybrid objects with semi fixed geometry.<br/>
 ** This means they can’t rotated in 3D, to be correctly orientated<br/>
 ** The components all have default colours, connectors often have standard defined colours for example CEEform, PowerLock and Camlock all use specific colour schemes<br/>
 ** Not possible to create square or rectangular input and output geometry<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * There is no easy/efficient workflow for naming components. Component names are vitally important if the user wants to be able to easily identify the component in the connection drop-down menus<br/>
<br/>
 ** Can&#39;t name them before insertion <br/>
 ** Names do auto-increment but not in a useful manor, for example if a component is called 16A-1 instead of the next or duplicated component being called 16A-2 it gets called 16A-11<br/>
 ** can&#39;t use Spotlight numbering as the components are inside the symbol<br/>
 * All connections between components have to be done using the drop-downs<br/>
 ** Drop-downs close the instant the user selects an option,<br/>
<br/>
 *** this means you have to reopen the drop-down to check the connection is correct<br/>
 *** the user can&#39;t make multiple connections without having to reopen the drop-down for each one<br/>
 ** They don’t display anything when closed, no current connection data or indication of multiple connections<br/>
 ** They display every possible connection without a logical order or method of sorting/filtering<br/>
 ** the user can&#39;t configure connections before inserting the component or components<br/>
 * Duplicating components can cause connection drop-down desyncs and errors that an be very time consuming to fix<br/>
 * There is now way to control or redefine the order of the output connections in the distributor objects OIP.<br/>
 * Electrical components don’t seem to have any form of labeling in 3D views, meaning the user has to manually label everything with text boxes<br/>
 * Because Electrical components are added to existing symbols, the components including internal fuses are visible in 2D views on top of all the distributor objects 2D geometry, meaning the user will always have to take the extra time to correctly rearrange the draw order of the components so they are hidden<br/>
 * Electrical components do not have any class controls other than manually assigning them to classes at creation<br/>
 * There is no easy method for the user to maintain an overview of the components inside a distributor object and how they are connected to each other when creating the distributor.<br/>
 The Component view of the Electrical planning web palette provides this but only if the distributor is used in a design and hooked up to a electrical generator.<br/>
 * electrical components don&#39;t document the connector length (relevant for all except fuse/breaker objects)<br/>
 * There is no way to document distributor circuit counts<br/>
 ** This is vital for documentation purposes as the circuit count may not directly correspond to the fuse/breaker count in the distributor.<br/>
<br/>
Potential solutions/enhancements<br/>
<br/>
After investing significant time in learning how to create and correctly configure distributor objects I have a number of ideas and thoughts about how to improve this process.<br/>
 # Re-purpose the component view of the Power planning web palette, so that all distributor objects are set up using this view.<br/>
 ## This would provide instant visual feedback about how the components are connected<br/>
 ## It could provide an alternative work flow for connecting electrical components, similar to how the user can patch objects in the Device graph<br/>
 ## Inserting components on a ‘virtual wiring schematic’ would eliminate the need to manually position and configure them in 2D and 3D space in relation to the distributor objects geometry.<br/>
 ## allow the user to use the electrical component tool in the component graph<br/>
 # Leverage ConnectCAD schematics to create the wiring diagram/model for the distributor objects<br/>
 ## An electrical wiring schematic is effectively identical to a ConnectCAD signal flow schematic, just with different component symbols<br/>
 ## It would provide further integration between the 2 products<br/>
 ## ConnectCAD already has most of the important features and tools required to create an electrical wiring schematic (each type of component would be a device with inputs and outputs defined by the type of associated connector, connect tool would be used to wire them and so on)<br/>
 # Rework the electrical component tool<br/>
 ## Add auto numbering<br/>
 ## Give the tool the ability to insert multiple components that will auto increment their name (similar to the ConnectCAD linear insertion mode)<br/>
 ## Select component type using a drop down?<br/>
 ## Add a way for the user to define the electrical components properties before insertion, possibly using styles?<br/>

 ### supply component<br/>

 #### connector length<br/>
 ### Input component<br/>
 #### Name<br/>

 #### Ampere<br/>
 #### Input (including options for inserting multiple fuse objects each connected to the input phases in a specific repeating pattern. For example a 1-2-3 configuration (fuse 1 goes to L1 of the input, fuse 2 to L2, Fuse 3 to L3, fuse 4 to L1, etc...) or a 4-4-4 configuration (fuses 1 through 4 to L1, fuses 5 thru 8 to L2, etc...)<br/>
 #### output<br/>
 #### Circuit number, in the physical world each fuse would be a single circuit. However, because there support for a 2-phase or 3-phase fuse we need a way to easily define that multiple fuses are part of a single output ‘circuit’<br/>
 ### Output<br/>
 #### Name<br/>
 #### geometry<br/>
 #### Scale<br/>
 #### Connector<br/>
 #### length<br/>
 #### Option to connect PE and Neutrals to input at insertion, it is almost a universal standard that all outputs will share a common connection to the input connectors neutral and physical earth pins.<br/>
 ### Consumer<br/>
 #### Name<br/>
 #### geometry<br/>
 #### Scale<br/>
 #### Connector type<br/>
 #### connector length<br/>
 #### link through (yes or no)<br/>
 #### Power factor <br/>
 #### Max voltage<br/>
 #### Min voltage<br/>
 ## Add classing options to the insertion tool or preferences<br/>
 ## add Option to use user created geometry for the component<br/>
 ## option to Label Component at insertion in both 2D and 3D<br/>
 # Rework electrical component objects<br/>
 ## make them symbol or style based <br/>
 ## Allow them to use user created or custom geometry<br/>
 ## Label position offset<br/>
 ## Add a circuit field to the Fuse object, this would make it far easier to define the internal connections to the outputs and allow multiple fuse objects to be grouped for easier reporting and documentation workflow. This would then be used in the patch table to define how distributors display their output circuits<br/>
 ## Add link through toggle to input components which provide a direct un-fused link through using the same connector type as the input (direct one to one pin patch)<br/>
 ## Add Linked or double socket option to output components so that a double output can be created with a single component<br/>
 ## Add classing controls<br/>
 ## add connector length field to all components using a connector<br/>
 ## Make them 3D only<br/>
 ## Give the user control over pen and fill colours so input and output connectors can be correctly coloured<br/>
 ## Make them completely virtual and only visible in the Component graph<br/>
 ## Display wiring connections in the drop-downs while they are closed to make it easier to see what is connected to what<br/>
 # Make it possible to set up a distributor from a excel spreadsheet or a worksheet which documents the various components and their connections<br/>
 ## Define input and output connector types<br/>
 ## Define number of circuits and fuse objects<br/>
 ## Define connections

                                            <td class="description">      Currently if you&#39;re in a 3D perspective view and want to add a RW camera that matches the current view, you must:<br/>
 # Activate RW Camera tool<br/>
 # Click once to set insertion point<br/>
 # Click again to set view direction<br/>
 # Move mouse over to OIP and click on &quot;Match Current View&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that steps 2 and 3 &quot;feel&quot; wrong because you&#39;re inserting a camera in an arbitrary spot just to get the object into the document. Most users don&#39;t realize this process is even possible until someone teaches it to them.<br/>
<br/>
What would be great is to have a separate mode button for the RW Camera tool that automatically inserts a camera that matches the current view when clicked.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about it though, a mode button might be challenging because how would it work when in Top/Plan?<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps instead it could be a new command under the View menu called &quot;Insert Camera at Current View&quot; which would insert a RW camera using the default RW camera settings. The command would only be available when in 3D perspective.<br/>
<br/>
A command would also be great because users could assign a keyboard shortcut to it. I would certainly use this a lot when finding camera views with a Director or Production Designer.<br/>
<br/>
There might also be an opportunity to add a command like this to the Camera palette.

1. Support for dynamic boolean search operations to support Resource Tags and Types (VE-101645 already submitted by myself). <br/>

2. Organic search results in search box. <br/>
<br/>
3. Saved (and named) search criteria (combined with dynamic boolean search this could augment/supplant the old fashioned file structure).<br/>
<br/>
4. Improved thumbnail resolution and size. <br/>
<br/>
5. Extended support for various attached Data eg; we can&#39;t see IFC/ Pset data, Material values etc. <br/>
<br/>
6. Dropdown options to the left of the search field is not very discoverable. <br/>
<br/>
7. Closing the File Browser Pane and/or the Preview Pane I hoped would actually reduce the overall size of the RM so that it would take up less screen real estate. Instead it actually expands the Resources Pane. Given the RM is screen hungry - it would be good to be able to trim it as required.

A dynamic search criteria such as &#39;Australia AND metal AND texture&#39; would return all of our sheet metal RW Texture resources. This would further relieve our reliance on the traditional filing structure inside of the RM.

<br/>
Currently we have a burgeoning number of tab-separated text files containing data:<br/>
<br/>
CableTypes.txt<br/>
ConnectorTypes.txt <br/>
SignalTypes.txt<br/>
<br/>
ConnectCAD Devices DB.txt<br/>
<br/>
JFdata.txt<br/>
TPdata.txt<br/>
<br/>
CustomParams.txt<br/>
CableLengths.txt<br/>
<br/>
Basically all text or number data in tables. The file format we are using makes no sense. It limits our ability to leverage the relations between these tables. All this data could be much better handled in a single file using an SQLite database. For example, device definitions in the ConnectCAD Devices DB reference signal types and connector types. And there are relations between signal and cable / connector types that could be defined as tables e.g. sig-&gt;conn. Then dropdowns can be populated using SQL queries that extract the relevant connectors and cables for each signal saving users from hours of scrolling.<br/>
<br/>
Editing these tables can be done either in the Settings dialog or for more complex tasks using  any of the many SQLite database editors available.<br/>
<br/>
SQLite is already integrated in Vectorworks so all we need to do is use it.

User followed up in his survey with other issues, as he describes ConnectCAD as having &quot;a lack of features.&quot; Here are his suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
In no particular order<br/>
#1 - I have to quit Vectorworks to update socket signal &amp; signal lists<br/>
#2 - moving a socket location inside a device breaks the connector alignment<br/>
#3 - Cannot rotate or mirror a device and still use connections<br/>
#4 - editing a device required zooming to the origin of the page. If that’s the case, do it automatically<br/>
#5 - object-based pulldown selection for “cable type”<br/>
#6 - allow building connections from output to input<br/>
#7 - the “number of circuits” option in a socket seems totally broken if it’s more than one<br/>
#8 - There doesn’t seem to be the usual method to create a symbol from a device<br/>
#9 - I’ve had text scaling issues with creating new devices<br/>
#10 - No way to move a connection from one socket to another without deleting.<br/>
#11 - attribute tool does not work with connections (see #5) <br/>
#12 - no way to put user-defined terminals or signals in VW-defined categories (network, audio, power, radio, etc.)<br/>
#13 - conductor-free connections are challenging to sort out. Example: (A) SFP network interface module into a switch. (B) A “Y” splitter<br/>
#14 - the difficulty in overlaying a connectCAD workspace on an existing designer workspace drawing.<br/>
#15 - a tool to clearly distinguish a “trunk” from a “connection” other than the convention of curved vs straight corners.

In the Device Builder we store user-created device definitions in a similar tab-separated text file in the user folder.<br/>
<br/>
So, logically the Device Builder could very easily be set to edit the the application database removing entirely the need for translating the data from Filemaker. All we need is a switch to enable an admin mode.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another potential benefit to this: at the moment we are logging new makes and models with a view to adding these to the database. We could potentially retrieve all the information entered by the user in the tab-separated format via logging and review it in the Device Builder, and save if useful.<br/>
<br/>
An easy workflow for the above would be to add the incoming device definitions in the user folder and have a Save to App Folder button in the admin interface.<br/>
<br/>
Entering as a VE to save the thought.<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
A second part to this: if you click on a device, could the Device Builder be able to read in its config. That could be a very useful admin tool for getting information from drawings into the device database...<br/>

We had a small but significant amount of requests to be able to show a virtual patch within a device. For example a Dante sound patch from a Yamaha console or Rio interface. We discussed and showed a potential workaround with multiple viewports on a sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
The customer was wondering if it would also be possible to get Yamaha to export the digital Dante patch from the console as a text file and use the create circuits command to draw the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
So it’s a two pronged attack. We should contact Yamaha to ask them to partner and secondly this workflow should be considered, I think it might needlessly complicate any future modular device tool, as the desire is to have circuit connections within a modular device (yikes!).<br/>
<br/>
Happy to also put you in touch with the customer if helpful.<br/>
<br/>
All the best<br/>

For example, if you search for &quot;Chair,&quot; any results that have a little cloud icon on the thumbnail are not local, but they will download immediately upon activating the chair symbol. This all makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
However, when looking at the primary categories of libraries in the lefthand panel of the RM, both &quot;Vectorworks Libraries&quot; and &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; live in the cloud by default as described above, which makes the cloud icon which represents &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; a bit confusing. I&#39;ve had a number of students get confused by the fact that Vectorworks Libraries are also in the cloud until needed, since they assume only Premium Libraries are cloud-based due to the category&#39;s icon.<br/>
<br/>
It would be clearer if the icon for &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; were changed to the diamond icon used on the Service Select content website (see attached screenshot). It would also be more cohesive since the visual branding would match.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud icon would then be reserved for individual files/resources to indicate whether they are local or cloud-based.

The parameter will only be visible and have effect when the &quot;Type&quot; of the material is &quot;Plaster/Stucco&quot; or &quot;Plaster/Stucco (detail)&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As of VW2022, the variation of the stucco thickness hardcoded to be dependent on the layer scale. This means that the stucco thickness will vary by 0.0525 inches (~1.3mm) on a 1:1 layer and 2.52 inches (~64mm) on a 1:48 layer. Users currently have to way to change this variation. It was made this way for visualization purposes way back when VW didn&#39;t have sheet layers and users had to use design layers for presentation.<br/>
<br/>
The new parameter will both allow users to set up the stucco to appear realistically on scaled layers and prevent issues where the stucco thickness variation will become larger than the stucco thickness itself (for example on 1:100 layers), causing user confusion.<br/>
<br/>
See the attached screenshots for an example of such issues and the possible solution. Also see the discussion in VB-181153.<br/>
<br/>
The LM objects can be forward-translated without the need of a reset, so that the new parameter will be initialized in accordance to the design layer scale. This will allow LM objects from current documents to not change in appearance when this parameter is eventually added.

If you do not activate all system objects, the traverse is released from the system.<br/>

If you could have an option &quot;FIX System&quot; in the object info, you don&#39;t have to manually activate all system objects in order to edit the entire system.<br/>

At the moment it is difficult to share GDTF data in a workgroup.<br/>
<br/>
These GDTF data are located in the plug-in folder and cannot be shared in workgroups. In the current workflow it is necessary to import these GDTF data into each drawing before you can select the GDTF mode for a Lighting-Device. It&#39;s frustrating and time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Better and faster is a worklfow in which you can share the folder / Applications / Vectorworks int 2022 / Plug-Ins / VW_Spotlight / Data directly over a workgroup without first importing the GDTF file into each drawing.

It should be great if it&#39;s possible to turn off the 2D pick up symbol separate in the OIP. Now it turns of the compleet 2d / 3d symbol. Now I have to put it on a separate class, what also works by default btw.

This is a request from French support: a colleague from support has contacted me about an error message an client got, which was the following:<br/>
<br/>
_There was a problem retrieving or storing your credentials. Please contact Vectorworks, Inc. or your distributor for more information on how to solve this issue._<br/>
<br/>
After she had looked into this, it turned out that this problem was linked to macOS and not to Vectorworks, but it cost some time to find out where the problem came from, for the customer and our support service. I don&#39;t think this problem can be solved through translation. Would it be possible to make this message a bit more &quot;precise&quot;, by adding a error code, so that it would be easier for the client and/or support to find the source of this error ?

It would be a result similar to the Double line polygon tool, but you could manipulate it from the centre line.<br/>
<br/>
You set the width, draw the line and when you need to amend the path, you only have to move the vertices of the centre line, not amend the other edges.<br/>
<br/>
It would also be necessary to be able to convert it to a polygon when done, as you could then use it to create objects from shapes, i.e. converting to hardscape/landscape areas<br/>

A better name would also be fab. Global width is very non-descriptive<br/>

For example, the attached screenshot returns a WMS of soil types of a particular area - this is fantastic, but I also want to be able to check what each colour represents within Vectorworks itself, to really be able to utilise this functionality to the fullest.

<br/>
This representation seems to be counterintuitive, since the user would best understand and acknowledge the grade moves in their 3D modeled position of the proposed site model surface.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, a distributor noted this concern in a forum post. [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/81805-site-model-3d-cut-an-fill-display-is-flat/] <br/>
<br/>
A suggested resolution to this challenge with the site mode would be a color gradation for cut volumes in specific areas and similarly for fill volumes, on the surface of the proposed site model. This may also require studying the competition&#39;s treatment of this, which in my initial search, I noted something very similar to what I am proposing.  !https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/SfjdWZSXdW8piXHZ_CGkYxMH2Hqg57INNBm0NOIreQygHn0Sm-o9e6gtQduaZwuk2ht5zp_gmQoiIBSy7xEqOzw2O8-e_rBEfhozoRVsemOETkfxC5pI9pdrj48GNMyhWaIf_tqx0HhVs3nqccc2WgWH3QUd!<br/>
<br/>
Possibly, there should be a consideration for changing the 2D plan view to incorporate the gradation of the cut and fill colors as well. !https://insitesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/06graphics02.png|width=454,height=436!<br/>
<br/>
Another benefit from conducting the 3D representation this way is to properly account for cut and fill sections for the site model. In its current state, the cut and fill representation would not give the proper section view, whereas the one I am proposing would. This would also require the software to provide a color &quot;fill&quot; to the area being cut or filled as the industry is used to producing.<br/>

At the moment, all these stages are bundled into a total &#39;net sum&#39; C&amp;F. It would be great to be able to separate stages, especially if we&#39;re looking at producing machine control files.<br/>
<br/>
For this, we would also need a &#39;fill&#39; mode for the site model, where you can fill up a previously created &#39;hole&#39; or &#39;dip&#39; and get the volume for the fill, as well as be able to control what material the fill is (site model components). This would also resolve the issue with freeboards in drainage calculations for water runoff ponds.

 if you click on the &#39;Settings&#39; button in the mode bar<br/>
Change the pane to &quot;Size and Spacing&quot;<br/>
Change the spread and hight information and then click ok <br/>
and place a plant by clicking into the drawing window.<br/>
<br/>
Then the placed plant uses the size and spacing that was entered into the plant preferences dialog.  This is the expected behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
However, at this point there is no clear or obvious way to reset the Size and Spacing to the size defined in the plant style.    This applies regardless of wether the active style remains the same or changes.<br/>
<br/>
The plant size does not defer to the plant style  if we change the active plant style (different plant styles normally have different sizes.  The dialog will not accept a null value in these settings.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least I would expect a button or some other way to change the setting to defer to the values set in the plant style.  As it stands with this build, once you change the settings in the plant preferences you will need to change them again every time you place a plant that requires different values.  Most plants will need different values...  This largely defeats the purpose of using plant styles in the first place.

                                            <td class="description">      There&#39;s currently a magic number (&quot;seed&quot;) in VW&#39;s binary and Plug-In Support (PIS). These seeds must match each other. This was implemented years ago as a way to support additional protection types, and to prevent users from &quot;switching&quot; protection. Of note, Japanese protection aka Series F used this, but was discontinued around 2016.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Mac code signing has arisen and this requires us to package two separate Vectorworks.app bundles in the installers (one for Series B and another for Series E), even though these 1.8GB bundles differ in just a few bytes (the seed is different). Thus, every user of Vectorworks is required to download a much larger file, and this also slows down building (because each app needs to be signed and notarized which includes transfer time to Apple and more time on Apple&#39;s servers) and uses more storage and time to transfer files, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In addition the whole PIS matching system makes it more difficult for users to change their protection (it requires a reinstall), and this makes it more difficult to move users off of Series Be and onto series E for example.<br/>
<br/>
I have a two-part proposal:<br/>
1) Seed unification: There&#39;s currently no benefit of having different seeds for series B and E. I want to make them both use the series E seed. Kamen has said there&#39;s no security benefit to having different seeds, and that it would be a minor change that has no user impact. I would like to do this as soon as possible (for mainline which will become VW2023) so we can immediately start reaping the benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the following seeds would still exist with seed unification:<br/>
Viewer - has its own seed (but not packaged in main installers)<br/>
Series A - we build series A. It might be worthwhile to just move everyone to series E builds but this isn&#39;t really a problem currently - at least not one that&#39;s relevant here.<br/>
<br/>
2) PIS removal: This is more complex, but basically means doing away with the PIS module and finalize removing our protection into the core of VW itself. I say finalize because Kamen has already done most of this -- the functionality for protection was moved to VW core in VW2019/VW2020. All that remains is the seed match and the determination of which protection to use, which remains in the PIS module.<br/>
<br/>
This would simplify VW somewhat, allow users to switch protections (based on serial) but would have some end user changes that Kamen can outline. We would need to address Viewer and this would probably require removal of Series A (local builds). I do think there are also benefits of keeping the protection code up to date and removing unnecessary complexities, both to reduce the surface for possible attacks and as best practice for ensuring efficacy. <br/>

Below you can find more feedback I&#39;ve got:<br/>

&quot;There are a few things you need to take into account before exporting, which is not mentioned in the help text (https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2021/eng/index.htm#t=VW2021_Guide%2FExport%2FExporting_3D_geometry_to_Revit.htm&amp;rhsearch=revit&amp;rhhlterm=revit&amp;rhsyns=%20).<br/>
<br/>
For example: If you want to export the 3D geometry , your active view needs to display all the objects you want to export. If just the active layer is visible, it will be the active layer only which exports. Maybe there are more things I didn&#39;t discover yet.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
An easy way to tell if 3D modeling software is worth its salt is the quality of its camera tool. Setting up camera views is a task relevant to ALL industries, and this process needs to be easy, intuitive, and informative. I wouldn’t describe the RW Camera tool as any of those things, personally, and at the moment I want to focus on one particular subject that is the most glaringly bad aspect of the current tool:<br/>
<br/>
The 4 blue crop corners. They’re terrible. They don’t actually frame your view in a way that allows you to compose an image within the ‘viewfinder’. Everything outside of the camera view is still just as visible, and since the crop corners are so small and disconnected, your eye can’t visualize the frame in order to make informed decisions. Composing an image is arguably the most important reason to use a camera in the first place, so the crop corners fail at their most important job.<br/>
<br/>
Spotlight’s Video Camera tool handles this slightly better because it uses a full rectangle instead of just tiny corner marks. However it’s still not ideal since the thick blue stroke is a bit distracting, and objects outside the rectangle are still fully visible. (Plus, using the Video Camera tool is not a workable solution in the first place.)<br/>
<br/>
Ideally RW Cameras would work more like they do in Cinema 4D, where the area outside the viewfinder gets obscured with a translucent black overlay. That would be a million times better.<br/>
 <br/>
The overlay should automatically be visible whenever you&#39;re in an Activated Camera view, and go away when working in perspective (non-camera). The color and opacity of this overlay should be controlled in Interactive Appearance Settings (some people might prefer a solid overlay which completely obscures outside the frame, whereas others might prefer to have the overlay be more translucent or even be a color).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Prior to 2022, one workaround that sidestepped the camera’s unusable blue crop corners was to turn on the “Cropped Perspective” document preference.  This setting would crop the view to the camera frame so that objects outside the frame weren’t seen, which was helpful when composing shots. While it had its own issues, it at least functioned fine for that purpose. However, Cropped Perspective was deprecated for 2022 as part of the screen plane deprecation task. So moving forward we’re left with no good way to view a camera composition, and this should be addressed asap.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are other improvements needed for the RW Camera tool but this would be the most impactful change.<br/>

Accessing the parts inside a cable object is a more time consuming process than with the old tools.<br/>
 * the user needs to access the cable configuration dialogue separately for each cable object, its not possible to group select and configure multiple cable objects&#39; parts at the same time<br/>
 * you can no longer directly edit cable parts inside a cable object by editing a cable worksheet, in the old tools the user could update the parts configuration for multiple cable objects by rapidly editing the appropriate cell in the worksheet and then move to the next directly.<br/>
 * cable parts can&#39;t be directly edited in the cable object properties<br/>

<br/>
Is it possible to make feature videos more accessible?<br/>
Right now, they are available in the Manual. To get access to them, you have to first open the right page in the User Manual and click the video link (2-step-procedure). As of Vectorworks 2022, video links are embedded in the Manual, which is a great UX improvement (see: [https://help2022.designexpress.eu/vwhelp/2022/PL/VW2022_Guid]<br/>
<br/>
But it would be nice to go even further, namely: to place a(n) button/icon next to &quot;What&#39;s this&quot; button in the title balk of dialog boxes with a direct link to such an video. The video should open as an pop-up in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to add an extra link in the dialogs for those plug-ins which have a video link available? See screenshot<br/>

<br/>
_&quot;It would be awesome if you could generate a 2-dimensional visualization of a Site Model&#39;s cut/fill, but instead of just static Cut = Red and Fill = Blue...you could assign a gradient for each that could color the site model based on cut severity or fill severity. For example a White to Red gradient for cut that the greater the value of cut, the deeper the shade of red. Additionally a White to Blue for fill that the greater the value of fill, the deeper the shade of blue. This would be an extremely useful way to visualize site models.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/82246-gradient-cut-fill-site-model-visualization/]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree with this request. I played around with data visualization to no avail. I see an opportunity to be able to visually see in 2D (top/plan) how much fill or cut is taking place at any point on the terrain.

At the moment we have a lot of different stylesystems:<br/>
<br/>
*Wall-, Slab-, Roofstyles*<br/>
If you edit a wallstyle you can choose which values should override from the new (changed) values and which not.<br/>
It&#39;s not possible to define if a value is from style or not.<br/>
You can create a new style in the wall settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
*PIO-Styles (f.ex Columns)*<br/>
In the OIP you can hide all styled parameters.<br/>
To define which values are from style you have to open two dialogs.<br/>
You cannot create a new style in the column settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
*Windows &amp; Doors*<br/>
In the OIP you can hide all styled parameters.<br/>
To define which values are from style you have only to edit the style<br/>
You cannot create a new style in the column settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view we should reduce to one stylesystem and change the existing tools in a multiple year project. It is desirable to change the dialogs of these tools simultaneously to Triptychon.<br/>
<br/>
The User Experience for working with styles will signifcantly rise!<br/>

It would be a useful enhancement of the Saved Views feature if the Saved View had an option to intelligently Fit To All in addition to the view angle etc. This is not available at present, which means that if the user intended the view to show all objects from a specific angle they have to constantly update the Saved View.<br/>

This happens quite a lot in a users modelling workflow.<br/>

In the User Interface a clearer separation of Vectorworks Preferences and Document Preferences would be desirable. For this step the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot; should change to a tryptichon dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
 * Edit Marker List... -&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Vectorworks Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Line Thickness.... -&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Vectorworks Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Units...-&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Georeferencing...-&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * ...<br/>
<br/>
Why is this wish a improvement for Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>
In order for the Vectorworks experience to be “easier to learn and easier to use” while, simultaneously, “improving the experience for current customers” this task reduce the preferences dialogs in the workspace and shows clearly which preferences are saved in the document and which are saved with Vectorworks<br/>

<br/>
It would seem this has always been the case with Door Hardware going back to previous versions. However it would be great if it just came through from the symbol if a texture is assigned. <br/>
<br/>
Email from a user for context: <br/>
<br/>
_I noticed this a while back then was caught out by it again this week so thought I’d forward it to you for comment._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_I have some 3D door hardware symbols that use a brushed stainless steel texture. When this texture is assigned to the 3D geometry within the symbol definition *by object* (in the Render tab of the OIP) or *by Material* (in the Shape tab of the OIP), the texture will not show up on the objects within the Door PIO. In order for the door hardware to display the correct texture in the model you have to assign the texture *by class*. If you don’t set the texture by class the door hardware, when selected within the door settings, will display as white (no texture) in the model._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_Is this working as designed or a bug?_<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_If I have a 3D symbol of a stainless steel door handle, that geometry is only ever going to have a stainless steel texture applied to it. This is why I originally specified the texture by object within the symbol definition: because I wanted it to be set fast + not subject to change. I have no need to control its appearance by class. Its finish is only ever going to be brushed stainless steel._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_When I realised that assigning the texture by object this way resulted in white door handles in the model I went back + assigned the texture by class + all was fine._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_Several months later I’ve forgotten this + have started using Materials (which I think are great by the way). I create a ‘Brushed Stainless Steel MT’ Material because I realise that I’ve been using a few different stainless steel textures across my objects/files + actually none of them render particularly well, so I create my own new texture + assign it to a Material + in this way can have a single ‘Brushed Stainless Steel MT’ Material that I can go to every time I have a brushed stainless steel object + very easily achieve consistency throughout + never have to try + remember which is the right texture to choose each time. Except that after assigning the new Material to my door hardware symbols I notice that the texture isn’t displaying in the models + I can’t figure out why, until I remember what happened before + have to go back + reassign the textures by class._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_To be clear: I am quite happy assigning the jamb/leaf textures by class as I have different classes for different colours/finishes + I can choose the appropriate class depending on the colour/s the door/frame needs to be, inside + out. But the hardware is slightly different in that it’s not part of the PIO as such: it is a 3D symbol that you’d expect to be able to control separately._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_So be good to know whether this is a bug or is simply how it’s always been + is likely to remain._<br/>

<br/>
we want to share a workgroup folder via VCS. So I am creating a folder with everything in it. I am Sharing it with a collegue and dont want him to edit it, so he has &#39;view and Download&#39; permission. To be sure he can use it with Vectorworks, he has to send it to the starting Screen (home-folder) of VCS. Now he sees it locally and is able to use of his Group-folder.<br/>
But whenever I am changing something within the shared folder, my collegue will never see it within his folder he sent to the starting screen (Only in &#39;shared with me&#39; section).<br/>
Means, he has to delete the folder on the starting screen and need to add the shared folder again to it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise my collegue needs full edit rights to synchronize this folder to the home screen automatically. But that&#39;s something I don&#39;t want to do.<br/>

Viewport parameters are also a little overwhelming for new users. It would be great to implement OIP Widget Groups for Viewports so that parameters are arranged into categories with headers, making it easier to find what you need.<br/>
<br/>
Implementing widget groups would be a great opportunity to reorganize parameters so that related settings are near each other. For example, Lighting Options and Image Effects affect the rendered portion of a viewport so they should be near the Background Render setting. There are currently a number of cases where the order of things in the OIP seems arbitrary and scattered, rather than presented logically.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached images I’ve laid out mock-ups of a Viewport and a Section Viewport OIP. I’ve carefully rearranged all the parameters into simple categories that I think would make sense to an average user. I’d be happy to further explain any logic behind these choices and why things are grouped and ordered the way they are.<br/>

If I am imagining this then this needs to be added.  If I am remembering correctly this needs to be brought back.  Suppose I have a group of circles, arranged in a semicircle.  Now I ant to duplicate and offset the duplicates by a few feet to make a second row.  I do not want the circles to be bigger, I do want the semicircle to be bigger.  This I do believe used tow ork and no longer does.

<br/>
Quick search should include the options within Vectorworks Preferences, Document Preferences, Spotlight Preferences, Units, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It could also include Snap settings (for example a user could search for &quot;Tangent&quot; or &quot;Master Snap Points&quot;) though there&#39;d have to be consideration for how the Quick Search interface interacts with the Utility Bar buttons and pop-overs.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Quick Search being envisioned and described as a &quot;universal search&quot; so it should continue to be expanded until it accomplishes this mission.

<br/>
Currently you have to click on each segment that you want to remove.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to also have the option to be able to click and hold and move the cursor over multiple segments, and have all the segments that you moused over be removed in one stroke. This could save a LOT of clicking in certain scenarios. It would even be beneficial for removing individual segments: it requires less precise clicking, thereby saving our already overworked wrists.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a video of a scenario I encountered today - the first half shows me using the Trim tool as it currently functions, then I hit undo several times, then I demonstrate the clicking and holding mouse strokes that would be used if this enhancement were implemented (Of course it doesn&#39;t do anything but hopefully you get the idea). Each segment would be trimmed away AS you mouse stroke over it.<br/>

<br/>
Railings are something that can go beyond a stair and are found in many places other than stairs, so by having railings built into the stair tool as well as a separate tool for railings, Vectorworks is doubling up on development effort. These tools should be separated out, so that Vectorworks can focus on making each of them excellent at what they need to do and so that use users can focus on modelling separate elements with less limitations and less variables to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
The more I model with Vectorworks the more I want to break things down into separate elements so that there are less variables and connections to think about. When too many things are bundled up into one tool it creates limitations that don&#39;t exist in the real world. Fine if you&#39;re modelling a square box. Not fine otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking slabs and roofs down into internal finishes, structure and external finishes is a good example of this. And it makes even more sense to me to do this with railings and stairs.

 # Needs to have length shown and alterable in the OI palette like any other linear construct.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I see this wished for *often* by users.{color}<br/>
 # Needs to have the Axis alignment in the OI using a radio button concept similar to that which is implemented for rectangles. The image used in the geometry settings window is well suited for the purpose.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// Would be nice but probably not easy to implement.{color}<br/>
 # The Angle profile should be rotated 180° so the top axis default alignment is to a leg face, not air. Most structural elements are installed utilizing Top of Steel elevation concepts.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// Certainly makes sense to me.{color}<br/>
 # There needs to be an edit mode to permit addition components and subtraction subtraction components. The insertion of one or more creating selection node(s) which can be dragged outside of the edit mode to relocate the component&#39;s position along the member&#39;s axis. I would suggest that the axis the components nodes snap to be the top centre axis. These components being 3d symbols or possibly 3d plugin geometry. The former is suited for adding stiffener plates, saddles and connection plates or angles among other things. The latter might be suitable for tools that arrange holes in the flanges or the web or for coping ends of Wide flanges. The ability of a component to remain either plumb to the layer or perpendicular to the axis of sloped members is also a consideration.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I&#39;ve seen similar abilities wished for from users.{color}<br/>
 # Being able to snap to those (in #4) nodes with dimensioning tools.<br/>
 # The ability to lock in a slope angle when altering the length of the member is also valuable for sloping steel roof and canopy structures; As is being able to set an angle as an alternative to setting an end elevation.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I see this wished for *often* by users.{color}<br/>
 # Component edit mode being accessible from the resource palette similar to how symbols are handled. That way all beams can be seen and their member IDs are also available for editing. Beams when placed in a plan layout may start out as being multiple instances like symbols but may need to be duplicated and edited as the development process continues.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I believe he wants *Styles* for the Structural Member.{color}<br/>
 # This is a very useful one and should be a wishlist item of its own: Have a Viewport type which can generate a beam or symbol from the definition. (for placement on sheet layers) Talking 3d here and all the various views that the basic Viewport can display. This creates an easy means to annotate each beam and symbol. Avoids possibly hundreds of classes and or layers being required to control visibility. The current process of laying out beams for a structure is still required but all the layout of each beam would be tremendously simplified and can utilize templates for annotation. One only needs to remember that all symbols and beams be created at their internal origin for best functionality.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// This is a more general &quot;Object View&quot; or &quot;Object Viewport&quot; wish.<br/>
// *NOTE*: *Graphic Legends* actually may be exactly the thing he&#39;s looking for.{color}<br/>
 # Having the Viewport mentioned above being able to tap into the member id and or symbol name to facilitate automatic labeling. Or would that be the other way around where labels in the Viewport tap into those ids and names?<br/>
 # Profile size should be editable as a pull down at the root level of the OI, not embedded behind a shape selection button.<br/>
 # The technical data that the individual members currently provide should be displayed in the OI or accessible from the OI via a button. Weight characteristics for the basic member is a useful piece of data that is currently not provided.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// This would be valuable and easy to implement.{color}<br/>
 # Custom sizes as currently provided in the individual member tools is also useful for those sizes that are not in the predefined setting. This is helpful when using bar angle, bar channel and some tubing sizes which are currently not in the selection lists.

And with this type of server, the subscription will be terminated the moment Vectorworks shuts down. When the file is opened again, Vectorworks gives a message that the subscription has been canceled and needs to be restored. This message appears several times in a row.<br/>

The wish is that Vectorworks will be made compatible with this type of server.<br/>

<br/>
Since the files work and keep their reference when they are moved to the local hard drive, the issue must be with the way their new server is set up.<br/>
<br/>
We never recommend working directly off of a server as many different issues can happen.<br/>

This does not seem to be a Vectorworks issue.<br/>

Response from ICT client after reading TechSupport&#39;s response:<br/>
<br/>
This is not a wrong setting of the server. Zeedrive makes a connection with sharepoint in Vectorworks thinking it&#39;s a network drive but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s an active link to Sharepoint with for example to the drive letter P. Vectorworks should follow the drive P and not //kabaz//. <br/>
<br/>
Can you look into this and make Vectorworks compatible with ZEE drive and sharepoint?

Several our Customers would like to add personal shapes to create Structural Member Objects not possible now.<br/>
We suspect that now the Shapes that you can choose are hard coded, so it is impossibile to add new types. Indeed, we can&#39;t find a index file containing the types that User can choose now. <br/>

When exporting a lighting rig with spotlight fixtures while using accessory hooks on it, the actual zero reference point changes. So the total fixture moves in the Z axe to the base.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand that this happens because it&#39;s a plugin object, but it still quite annoying for the people who has to import the file. <br/>

Please see attached screenshot of the example (imported myself in vwx).

<br/>
The current workflow with GDTF data is confusing. We have 2 files in the library for one Lighting device type.<br/>
1. Lighting device<br/>
2. GDTF file<br/>
<br/>
If you import the GDTF file and insert it into the drawing you have a 2D / 3D symbol. This is confusing for the customer. He is expecting a lighting device here.<br/>
<br/>
You have to insert the lighting device into the drawing and then import the GDTF file into the document.<br/>
If the GDTF file has been imported into the document, the GDTF mode must also be selected in the OIP of the lighting device. That takes time. The user does not want to have to do two imports here.<br/>
<br/>
It would be better to have a folder for GDTF files, independent of the lighting device library.<br/>

They do turn up as a Symbol in the RM. The idea is that a Vw Plant Style could simply be associated with an Enscape Symbol (thereby circumventing the requirement to import an obj and embed that mesh object into the 3d component of the Plant Style). This approach might provide all the flexibility needed for:<br/>
(i) the User (to couple whatever Plant Style they like with whatever Globe Plant asset they choose),<br/>
(ii) for Globe Plants (to quickly expand their library with low poly versions of their content for use in Vw) and ultimately<br/>
(iii) to relieve someone of the onerous task of building Vw Plant Styles with Globe Plant meshes.

This is very similar to the Part dropdown in the OIP Render tab pre-2022. However, in the Wall Preferences dropdown the names of the selected textures for each Part are not displayed in the dropdown list.<br/>
<br/>
It would be useful to show the assigned texture names in parentheses so that you can quickly and easily see what textures are applied to each part without having to select each part manually.<br/>

Here are some requirements and benefits of such a redesign:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * The Record/Format should allow hierarchical organization of parameters to be a direct replacement of the DataSerializer.<br/>
 * The Record/Format should allow easy creation and management of parameter set repetition. That is a group of parameters, that repeat in an array like structure.<br/>
 * Improve the performance by re-engineering the compact/decompact mechanism in the current implementation.<br/>
 * Only one data structure instead of 2 (VWRecordFormatObj and VWDataSerializer)<br/>
 * Backward Compatibility<br/>
 * Get rid of undo problems caused of the usage of our own ComputerWorks data tag.<br/>
 * Support standard tools like the Eyedropper tool as every tool has access to the data of every other tool<br/>
 * All values of an pio will be available in the data manager and worksheets<br/>
 * All values will/can be available/visible in the obj info palette.<br/>
 * Clear structure of all data (including all attribute types)

While it makes sense for this to occur when zoomed out really far, the zoom threshold for this is currently way too low which is quite unhelpful. Users often need to be able to evaluate a drawing or sheet from a zoomed out point of view, but when dashed lines are misrepresented as solid it can be misleading.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s confounding is that the dashes can be seen when panning and/or actively zooming, but when simply viewing the drawing they&#39;re shown as solid. So clearly there are plenty of screen pixels available to display these dashes.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a video demonstrating what I&#39;m talking about. To be clear, the way it looks when zooming and panning is what&#39;s desired, and that same level of fidelity should be displayed when not zooming/panning.

I remember discussing this with someone at the 2018 summit but it has not had any traction so I am bring it up here. Also, we need drain depressions (sumps) to be part of the 3D model to make it more realistic.

<br/>
This I think needs to change. The clear space should be the &#39;stall width&#39; and the partition thicknesses should be in addition to that. So if you set a stall width of say 850mm then that should be the clear space between partitions. This would make it much easier to ensure compliance with statutory space standards.<br/>
<br/>
If say the left hand partition is deselected, that end stall will have a wider clear space than the adjoining stalls by half the partition thickness. Normally you would want the clear spaces in the stalls to be consistent.<br/>
 <br/>
The stall depth (length?) retains it&#39;s clear dimension irrespective of the partition thickness, which is a very useful implementation but inconsistent with that of the width.<br/>

Second, in a large project the amount of zones will be very long ( in the Netherlands Zones are used for assigning construction numbers, building/ apartment numbers, apartment types and fire compartmentalization) all the categories and names are in the same list browser creating a huge list: handling a zone is verry hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the (because the user cannot assign more than 5 zones to a space) the dialog could be split up in the five zones (see screenshot), zo when the user selects a category in the first zone, only names belonging to that category are selectable in the second popup. And when the user has selected the name of the first zone the second zone becomes available.

It would be nice to be able to see what Fonts are being used in a document in the form of a report.

For that matter, it would be terrific to be able to &quot;locate the font&quot; as a contextual right-click in a document, the result of which would highlight all instances of the font.

<br/>
It would be great to have line attributes (not only a class) for objects beyond the cut plane of a section viewport. For more informations and where I see a workflow optimization please watch my movie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that this very small change would be lead to better default section results.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made some tower trusses for my ground support towers, what worked really well in 2021. Now with the new magnet system, vertical truss doesn&#39;t behave well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Preview of the attached truss is horizontal instead of vertical.<br/>
 * I&#39;d selected no roll allowance on the truss parts because of thicker tubes on one side. That causes that the top block cannot rotate snap on the top of the tower. Please advice.<br/>
 * Cross section data truss length sometimes disappears when importing symbols from my workgroup library. So when importing the length data is empty.<br/>
<br/>
Please see attached video and file. I&#39;ve included also the 2021 file as reference how it should work.<br/>

<br/>
As you also probably realize too working remotely or on virtual machines become more and more important even for smaller offices. Sooner or later it becomes state of the art and it would be better to be prepared for that.<br/>
<br/>
We already have regularly requests about it but at the moment bigger companies or authorities asking for these kind of solutions. But we think that in times of &quot;Working@Home&quot; and more flexible working environments the issue become more important. In the past we already lost some offices and authorities because the performance in the tests were not that good and it seems that ArchiCAD and Allplan can handle it better. Honestly we do not have comparing numbers it is just what us the companies told us. However, we think it&#39;s worth to her these solutions in mind.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently this is how the system requirements look:<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Remote and Virtual Machines*<br/>
<br/>
We do not consider remote login environments such as Remote Desktop, Terminal Services and VNC or virtual machine environments such as Parallels and VMware to be appropriate for regular work, so Vectorworks performance in these situations is not of primary concern to us. They may be appropriate for administrative testing or utility purposes, and Vectorworks is fully functional in these environments. You should not expect high performance in these environments, however, especially with interactive screen feedback.<br/>
<br/>
We do support Vectorworks running under Boot Camp on Mac machines. As long as you have appropriate and current drivers for the hardware on your machine, you can expect fast and reliable Vectorworks behavior.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
We think in the future all or at least some of these technologies should be supported because they become more popular. The huge benefit is often that you do not need a super high end computer to run Vectorworks @home if you have access to a high end virtual machine.<br/>
Itten Brechbühl is thinking in this direction. They will switch in the near future to such a system and did some performance test. We know that this is the 4th biggest architect office in Switzerland but we know that others also smaller once discuss this. BTW, Itten Brechbühl will also offer this as a service to other companies.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all said I need to mention that I&#39;m not the super expert in these technologies. But I would like to bring that on your radar by adding this enhancement request for future versions.<br/>

For that matter, it would be great to have an entire folder of Color Palettes to be visible in the Vectorworks Application Support folder, allowing the individual color palettes to be more easily transferred between documents, or transferred between machines.

If you create a section viewport in combination with drawing a new section line, the section line will only be visible on the active design layer. Wish:<br/>
 * Option to set the visibility of the section line in the &quot;Create Section Viewport&quot; dialog.<br/>
<br/>
If you create a top/plan viewport all section lines are invisible. Wish:<br/>
 * Option to set the visibility of section lines while creating a top/plan sheet layer viewport<br/>

I think the light beam should be seen with the same fog settings the source has to mimic a real world situation. I have not been able to get a beam to visibly reflect off of a flat mirror surface and see the beam in fog from the surface.

As an electrician who lays out systems and deals with balancing loads between legs, I would prefer that each consumer tells me with Phase/Leg they are pulling power from. Since we offer a drag and drop interface within the web palette, allowing our users to know which lights are in which leg will allow users to reassign patching as they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Considering we have lighting units that pull from two legs (240V units here in the USA), we need to know which legs are being used.

This is okay for some scenarios but is typically an extra hassle. For example:<br/>
-Sometimes I&#39;m working with an untextured white model and don&#39;t want to deal with textures at all.<br/>
-Sometimes I have one texture that I&#39;m using across multiple objects, and I need some of those objects to cast shadows and others to not cast shadows, and as it stands you have to make two different textures and keep them cohesive as shader changes are made.<br/>
-Sometimes I want entire container objects to not cast shadows, such as a Symbol of a chandelier that contains many different objects/textures. It&#39;s currently a pain to separately determine shadow settings for each texture that may be used (and sometimes requires also duplicating those textures since they&#39;re used elsewhere with shadows).<br/>
-Switching between textures during the design process means having to track shadow settings across different textures each time you switch.<br/>
-Textures that are assigned via Materials or via parts of PIOs involve another layer of complication.<br/>
<br/>
In general we need the ability to set shadow settings on a per-object basis, which would be much easier. This would be an additional Widget Group in the Render tab of the OIP called &quot;Shadows&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Within that category would be two dropdowns. One would be called &quot;Cast Shadows&quot; with the following options:<br/>
-By Texture<br/>
-Cast Shadows<br/>
-Do Not Cast Shadows<br/>
<br/>
The second dropdown would be called &quot;Receive Shadows&quot; and would have the following options:<br/>
-By Texture<br/>
-Receive Shadows<br/>
-Do Not Receive Shadows<br/>
<br/>
For each dropdown, the &quot;By Texture&quot; option would be default and would match/retain existing functionality. Anyone who doesn&#39;t want to assign shadow settings per-object could collapse the widget group and everything would function as it always has.<br/>
<br/>
The latter two options would supersede any shadow settings coming from the texture(s) for that object, and make the entire object cast or not cast shadows (or receive/not receive). If the object is a container object, it would also override the shadow settings of any sub-objects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that when novice users first want to disable shadows for objects, the first place they tend to think of looking is the Render tab. They assume it would be a per-object setting, not a per-texture settings.<br/>
<br/>
While having the ability to do it per-texture is also useful, we need the ability to quickly and easily do it per-object.

Navigating (pan/zoom/z-axis rotation) in an orthographic projection has a significant FPS improvement opportunity.  For small delta navigations most of the pixels in the previous frame are shifted, stretched, and rotated but otherwise mostly unmodified in the next frame (assuming no view dependent material are in use such as reflections) allowing for an inexpensive blit operation to be utilized instead of a more expensive standard render.  This task detects this sItuation and uses it to improve ortho navigation performance which affects Sheet Layers, Design Layers in Plan, and Design layers in 3D ortho views.<br/>
<br/>
The algorithm is as follows:<br/>
 # SyncCamera is called followed by RenderScene<br/>
 # if camera modification is not compatible with reprojection<br/>
 # standard render and go to 6<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 # the previous recorded frame is textured mapped to the current frame buffer via a screen aligned quad that has been transformed to the correct place<br/>
 # the next pseudo random NxM rectangular screen aligned window is used to construct a view frustum used for culling and also set as the scissor rect for the frame<br/>
 # optionally all the NxM windows where there was nothing reprojected could be included for culling and stenciled in instead of scissor rect&#39;d, since they could be disjoint areas<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 # standard render within the scissor (or stencil) area over top of the previous frame blit<br/>
 # copy current frame to be used in next frame<br/>
<br/>
This algorithm gets its performance by dividing the viewport into NxM pixel sized rectangles and cycling through each one every frame to draw the objects in the chosen rect instead of all visible objects.  the order cycled through should be random to obfuscate an observable pattern.  over several frames all of the NxM rectangles will have been visited and the result will look as if a single standard render had occurred.  The cost to render an entire frame is amortized across several frames.  This means RenderScene needs to be called many consecutive times if navigation pauses (e.g., one mouse wheel click should spam 60 sequential calls instead of a single one).  The NxM size is a tradeoff of FPS vs artifacts in the generated frame.  if NxM is the size of the viewport then rendering will function as it would without reprojection enhancements and no artifacts will be visible.  The artifacts appear as video compression noise.<br/>
<br/>
no ui changes are necessary for this task<br/>
<br/>
test this task by navigating in ortho via pan and mousewheel zoom and interactive zoom and with view transitions for FPS improvements and image correctness within acceptable artifact levels.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
VW2022 defaults Shaded render mode Curve tessellation (Detail) to Low and Shadows to off which makes curved surfaces look bad/faceted and missing shadows which are defaulted on in competitor applications.  This task takes the bold step of defaulting the Shaded curve tessellation and Shadows quality to High for new files so renderings look better by default.<br/>
<br/>
The tessellation quality is a tradeoff of resources (navigation performance, processing, memory) for image quality.  The setting should be high unless that would cause a significant impact.  There are a number of factors that would lead a user to turn down the quality but GPUs are better than they once were.  VGM has mitigating optimizations such as geometric LOD to reduce the FPS impact of higher tessellation options.<br/>
<br/>
This task also uses a new educational alert (with &#39;do not show this again&#39;) describing the pros/cons of adjusting the Shaded Detail quality which appears the first time a scene with curvy geometry is rendered in Shaded.  The boolean indicating that the alert has been shown is a VW pref.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Q &amp; A<br/>
 # Does this task impact existing files?<br/>
 # No.  This task only affects new files<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 # Can the default tessellation quality be chosen at runtime based on GPU performance?<br/>
 # When a new file is created, there is nothing to render so Very High would work fine at that point.  The optimal value for tessellation quality depends on how many curvy objects are in the scene, where in the scene the user is looking, whether Shadows is on, amount of VRAM, and other factors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 # Can the &quot;Detail&quot; label in Shaded Prefs be called Curve Resolution or Curve Quality or Curve Detail?<br/>
 # Yes, and it should be

This VE would allow users to nominate a maximum height for the worksheet such that when that height was exceeded, the worksheet data would add additional pager to the right, in a similar way to how Project Revision History Worksheets are set out.<br/>

Options would need to include the addition of a header row on each page and also the distance between each page. I am assuming here that this would still just produce a single Worksheet Image object.<br/>

2. Go through the Dialog to install Vectorworks<br/>

3. When Vectorworks is installed, we have a checkbox to start Vectorworks and a button to close the pre-installer dialog. In here, we could have one of two possibilities:<br/>
<br/>
3.1. A checkbox that will take the Pre-Installer dialog/windows back to the start, with the purpose of, as example, to install the Viewer afterwards. Without the need of manually closing and re-opening the Pre-Installer Dialog. If this checkbox is active, the &quot;start vectorworks&quot; checkbox should be greyed out.<br/>
<br/>
3.2. When finished installing Vectorworks (or the Viewer), a dialog will pop up asking if we want to perform any more actions, if we choose yes then the Pre-Installer Dialog would go back to the start so we can perform any other actions... like installing the Viewer or PSS, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At the end this checkbox or pop-up would appear every time, because the Customer might need to install a myriad of tools that we might have available in the Pre-Installer Dialog: Vectorworks, Viewer, Project Sharing Server, read PDF Tutorials, etc.<br/>

It would be nice if a worksheet could have a crop. This would allow to show only a part a worksheet on a layout. Examples:<br/>
 * Worksheet of all room areas of one floor layout (without having to create separate worksheets)<br/>
 * Create a print layout with more than one page of a long worksheet<br/>
 * Show a reduced worksheet on one layout without all cells (rows, columns)<br/>

In most cases this means the planner has to include these joiners in the cable run material counts. <br/>
The new cable tools allow the user to create these joiners and manually add them to the cable parts list but it is slow and time consuming to have to go through each cable run and add the joiners in. <br/>
Having a method of automatically adding this type of joiner would be a good quality of life improvement and help speed up cable planning workflow.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*What&#39;s the current behaviour:* <br/>
<br/>
In the creating dialog of viewports the user have the option to create a viewport with the combination of drawing number and sheet number. Every change to one of the two values (drawing number and sheet number) after the viewport was created has no influence to the name of the viewport. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Why is the name of a viewport important:*<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to control the visibility of classes of a viewport you can open the organization dialog, go to classes and change the dialog to visibilities. After this change you see how important the name of viewports are.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*What could be the future behaviour:*<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if the name of a viewport could be set. For example:<br/>
<br/>
1. Contraction for the kind of viewport (examples)<br/>
<br/>
-&gt;  a floorpan (Top/Plan View) -&gt; FP<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; a section viewport -&gt; SV<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; a horizontal section -&gt; HS<br/>
<br/>
2. Scale of the viewport<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; 1:50 -&gt; 50<br/>
3. Sheet-Number<br/>
4. Counter<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; This is important for all workflows where a viewport is duplicated<br/>

Most other popular BIM programs have multiple, high-quality rendering options (including Sketchup), and the relative dearth with VW puts our users at a competitive disadvantage. I mention this because I&#39;m encountering this in my own practice.<br/>
<br/>
While Renderworks works well, Redshift has some ways to go before it matches RW, in my view, both in speed and in implemented features.<br/>
<br/>
We have, on the Mac, a link with TwinMotion. TM is strong in animation, entourage and exteriors, but for interior renderings it does not match up--in my view--to Renderworks Styles. Also, the latest versions have removed user access to certain features, such as ambient occlusion, so it&#39;s hard to control the quality of interior renderings. In other respects TwinMotion is a fine program but there are others which would be extremely helpful to incorporate or link to (not the least because they&#39;re powerful and can yield superior results).<br/>
<br/>
V-Ray is very desirable, from my personal viewpoint. Its integration with Sketchup makes it relatively simple and quick to use with that program because of a simplified interface that appears quite intuitive. No reason the same could not be done with Vectorworks.<br/>
Others would include: <br/>
Enscape for the Mac (when it comes out next year)<br/>
Maxwell<br/>
FluidRay (which, I think, is a dark horse, and its relative newness might make them amenable to some kind of deal)<br/>
perhaps Artlantis (which has a link to Archicad).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other programs, such as Sketchup, Archicad and Revit all have several integrated or linked rendering options readily available. Vectorworks Mac users, at this moment, notably only have (aside from RW and Redshift) TwinMotion. Other powerful renderers are out of reach, either because they don&#39;t operate on a Mac, or because they&#39;re not available via VW integration (and few of them have standalone versions). This leaves Mac-based VW users operating at a real and significant disadvantage out in the real world. Hence the reason for this enhancement request.

<br/>
If you have the material information in a custom Vectorworks record format and you “map” this to the material “component 1&quot; it’s not working. Normally the data manager mapping is a kind of override. If you add f.e. the BaseQuantities to the mapping table then the mapped value will be exported.<br/>
<br/>
Would be nice if the Material information would behave the same. If you have defined a Material mapping in data manager this will just &quot;override&quot; the exported pre-defined material of components. If it is empty the component material (Wall, Slab, Roof) will be exported.<br/>

It would be nice if dimension and worksheet text leaders and trailers could be much longer as well.

<br/>
VW allows to map a wall component but not a slab component. <br/>
<br/>
Users need to create extrusions and then auto hybrid object but there is another problem: material surface area is correctly calculated only on slab component or on a wall component, and not on extrusion where WV calculate every surface area. <br/>
<br/>
To manage tile area from a slab we need to generate a component to material quantities and then extract an area to creare a NURBS surface to manage the texture.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s why for BIM model we need to have control for texture mapping on a slab components: for texture and quantities<br/>

It means also that &quot;Legacy 2D Features&quot; can be turned off and in the meantime &quot;unified view&quot; is turned off too. The user have to turn &quot;unified view&quot; on by using a saved view.<br/>

There should be an option in the tool settings to set the tool default attributes and a checkbox/button in the Mode bar to use the document attributes or Tool Attributes.<br/>
<br/>
This could be useful when annotating drawings at the same time as working on them if you are not using class attributes. You could set the Dimension tools to have a different line color and line weight and have that used as a Tool Attribute while not effecting the attributes you have set for other objects. This could be useful for other types of annotating of drawings also.<br/>

<br/>
It would be great to have the possibility to save only selected Sheet-Layers (with all the visible classes and design-layers of the viewport(s)) as a new Vectorworks-Document.<br/>
This feature would be a solution for this workflow: You have a BIM-Modell with all the different informations in Sheet-Layers. For the Landscape Architect (who use Vectorworks, too) you would like to Export only the Sheet Layers with the urban planning.<br/>
<br/>

I have a user who has complained of getting migraines due to the dark blocky look of the new opacity slider in the attributes palette.<br/>

They have requested that the option is added into Vectorworks to change the size and color of the opacity slider.  Maybe even give the option to revert back to how it used to look in Vectorworks 2021 and before.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When using the bracket accessory you can effect the z height of the symbol by adding a loci including a parts record - point. The downside of this is that you have to make a separate bracket per fixture type when the are base height differences. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Should be great if you can add a loci to the base of the symbol, and a loci on the bottom of the bracket.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Another solution for me can be adding the accessory already within the fixture symbol positioned on the correct base height. Currently when inserting this method, the bracket will move to the bounding box, and you stil.  have to adjust this at edit acc.<br/>

After a time, half a year or a year, we have data that says what menus and tools a user has used in that time and which ones they have never used.  I think it would be a good feature to add a purge unused tools and menus to the Purge dialog (or maybe workspace editor).<br/>

I do not know if search has an option to add a found tool or menu to the current workspace if it is missing.  So as an additional VE if the search could have an option to add a tool or menu to the current workspace that would allow users to run with a minimal workspace and easily add any tools they need later.<br/>

<br/>
From a client I was training today, the ability to show tolerance in *both* of the above cases is needed as part of their highly precise, machine design oriented work. At very least, the ability to show tolerances should be available when the user chooses to show _either_ the primary or secondary units of a dual unit standard, as is possible when a single unit dim standard is used.<br/>

Truss Crosses auto-populate and are not assigned a class. A user showed me a file he was working on last week and it kept adding in thousands of Truss Crosses and it was making it hard to work. I was able to help him build a selection script to remove them but this seems like a silly workaround. I&#39;d like to offer two recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
1 – A Spotlight Preference function to assign Truss Cross objects to a *+user-defined+* class. This would allow users to the ability to easily turn Truss Cross object visibility on and off.<br/>
<br/>
2 – A Spotlight Preference that allows users not leveraging Braceworks (which are most users) to be able to simply disable Truss Cross insertion. This way users avoid file bloat with objects they will never use.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, this is not always how it works in the real world.  In normal productions, all the trusses that make up a position will almost always use the same name. Forcing the user to add a number causes issues identifying truss systems. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For example, a user may have 7 or 8 trusses in the house that are labeled &quot;House Truss 1&quot;, &quot;House Truss 2&quot;, and so on.  This will cause data tags and other methods of reporting to show &quot;House Truss 1-1&quot; and &quot;House Truss 1-2&quot; and so on for each truss object that makes up the position name.  This can make the paperwork and data tags very confusing<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks needs to have a unique identification system then it should use a different field or give the user a new field for the position name.

It would be nice if the function &quot;Validate 3D Data&quot; could automatically launched when using the command &quot;Site Model from Source Data&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view, it is bad that we allow to create a model from faulty bases, and then later explain at the helpdesk that there is Validate-Command.<br/>

<br/>
Whenever there&#39;s an alpha channel in a source image it&#39;s highly likely that a user wants that same alpha channel in the Image Prop. If not, they could easily switch the radio button back to &quot;No mask.&quot;<br/>

And if a user is importing dozens of Image Props, the 6+ extra clicks to get the mask loaded really bog down the process.<br/>

<br/>
In the current workflow with the light values from &quot;Lighting Device&quot;, it is difficult to use the correct values for rendering. Here you first have to read the value from the Lightinfo Record - convert it - and then enter it manually if you want to use this value.<br/>
Here we would have to automatically bring the value from the Lightinfo Record into the Brightness Value field.<br/>
The values are already available in all Devices.<br/>
<br/>
This saves our users a lot of time and errors in creating realistic renderings<br/>

Each control in the *Wrap* column controls the enable state of all controls to the right of it and each control in the *Use Custom Thickness* (the column with no header text) controls the enable state of the &quot;Custom Thickness&quot; control to the right of it.<br/>
<br/>
Not only is this an issue but, since all three columns have no checkmarks by default, they cannot even tell what kind of control they are and users don&#39;t even know what to do to enable the disabled controls.<br/>
<br/>
If these columns were to show actual checkboxes, there would always be a visible control (regardless of its selection state) making its enable state obvious to the user.

<br/>
A selection box for selected objects is not ideal as it is not always clear what items are selected. The White/Blue PgUp/PgDn &quot;individual edit mode&quot; is broken in that we cannot guarantee White/Blue light without removing the light train (which breaks other user workflows).<br/>
<br/>
(First problem)<br/>
Why was White/Blue added?<br/>
Because you couldn&#39;t tell what individual edit as &quot;active&quot;. The red/orange outline solves this issue as a red outline will identify the item being individually edited; just like VW.<br/>
<br/>
(Second problem)<br/>
Why is it hard to tell what lights are selected if all lights are already at 100%? <br/>
Because we render a bounding box and not each selected item with an orange outline.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe one fairly straight-forward solution would be to remove the White/Blue behavior, keep PgUp/PgDn for cycling through individual edits, still force the dimmer to 100%, and implement proper orange/red highlights.<br/>
<br/>
You could use PgUp/PgDn and see what is selected via a red vs orange highlight; which solves our &quot;first problem&quot;. If a fixture is already at 100% and it is selected, you will be able to tell it is selected via an orange highlight; which solves our &quot;second problem&quot;. And, we can still force the dimmer to 100% in the event you want to edit the light train for live feedback of things like shutters or changing gobos.

Or, let&#39;s add a &quot;Trim (Top)&quot; option.<br/>
Considering that most rigged projectors hang down from the truss, allowing the user to set the top to match the truss trim height without the need to do the math makes a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, for those hanging projectors from ceilings, specifying the height from the top allows for easier math. If the user knows their ceiling is 20&#39; and they have a 24&quot; mount, they enter 18&#39; for the top of the projector. Thus, removing the need to measure the projector itself and adding that measurement to figure out where the bottom of the projector will be.

                                            <td class="description">      Despite the advent of Project Sharing we still find ourselves (reluctantly) splitting files up in order to minimise memory usage when working in the main model file (and, to a lesser extent, save and commit time). If we weren&#39;t slowed down by large numbers of Sheet Layers and Viewports we&#39;d almost certainly keep everything in one file. <br/>
<br/>
So in order to split files up we have to use Workgroup Referencing. But Workgroup Referencing is cumbersome, because the process of editing the model file, then doing a save and commit, then waiting for Dropbox to sync, then updating the workgroup reference is a long one. But the main culprit is the last step, updating the workgroup reference. Because it fetches the entire file every time you do it.<br/>
<br/>
So until Vectorworks can handle a large number of Sheet Layers and Viewports without getting bogged down, it would be great if we had a new form of referencing that worked more like Project Sharing:<br/>
 # It would support delta updates rather than having to fetch the entire file<br/>
 # It would have a refresh button like Working Files do<br/>
 # But it would behave differently to a Working File in the that you could create Sheet Layers that aren&#39;t pushed back to the Project File<br/>
<br/>
Additional reasons to modernise WGRing:<br/>
 * Wall tags [currently don&#39;t work|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/68686-ability-to-tag-walls-in-workgroup-reference-files/] in WGR files<br/>
 * Any adjustments to gridline bubbles are wiped out any time the reference is updated.<br/>
 * I invariably find bugs that make something look different in the WGR file than in the original model file. If that bug gets fixed, then next time I find something else. One example I&#39;ve come across this week is the foliage tool. I have a particular hedge type that looks way denser in the WGR file than in the original model, which forces me to move my viewports back to the original model file.

Typically this has related to their drawing/modelling schema... Objects and general controls on the left side of the screen, Object info and navigation on the right side. Our current default workspaces also start with this arrangement. <br/>
<br/>
Given this, would it be possible to add an option to allow users to have the new snap buttons appear at the left side of the new utility bar?<br/>
<br/>
Only permitting the snap buttons to be in one location seems like it may be needlessly tempting complaints from users. While I have sen quite a wide variety of customized workspaces, I have never seen our existing snapping palette placed in the lower right. Either locating the snapping button set at the left side by default, or at least providing the choice of side or middle, would be more in line with the rest of our ideology of enabling users to arrange their workspace as they would like.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

<br/>
Ideally, Mask objects would:<br/>
 # be able to create cropped bitmap objects based on their parent viewport&#39;s render background.<br/>
 # Apply antialiasing at the crop of the bitmap objects.<br/>
 # Apply the the same Image Effects used for the parent viewport.  This is very important for users because Image Effects are often used for renderings.  It is expected that Camera Match Masks support it.<br/>
<br/>
This is an internal request to provide true antialiased masks while improving performance and also required in order to support Image Effects for viewport.

It can also be frustrating having to hunt down the latest consultant PDF files on our server and within the project team.  This got me to wishing consultant’s PDFs could be stored and viewed within my VW project file.<br/>
VW currently allows us to create a new Sheet Layer and import a consultant’s PDF. However, doing this for many sheets takes a lot of time and creates a lot of sheet layers making the Sheet Layer tab in the Navigation Palette very crowded.  <br/>
 <br/>
This idea works similar to a PDF reader but within the VW workspace. A user can upload a combined set of consultant PDFs and within a new tab in the Navigation Palette the uploaded PDFs are available to the project team within the project file allowing for seamless coordination and review within one program - Vectorworks.<br/>
 <br/>
Below are some high-level highlights of the feature and how it could work within VW allowing users to streamline their projects. Once again proving that VW is an industry leader.  <br/>
 <br/>
* All team members can be sure they have up-to-date consultant drawings at their fingertips even when working “off-line”.<br/>
* Multiple View Panes allows for review and coordination in a single software creating a streamlined process.<br/>
* With the tools and commands that already exist within VW’s tool palettes, adding comments to consultant drawings is quick and easy.<br/>
* Consultant drawings are stored under a new tab in the Navigation Palette. This keeps the Sheet Layers and uploaded PDFs separate limiting a crowded Sheet Layers tab.   <br/>
* Compiling of complete construction sets can be done with ease through VW’s “Publish” feature without the need for additional software.

Nowadays bridle parts for the bridle tool will picked (as far as I discovered) from the Stock Bridle Parts file in the applications library on your local machine. In case working with a Workgroup, the thing you actually want is that you can refer to the Workgroup folder instead of the application folder in the rigging bridle tool.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Currently one of the most common requests from our European rigging users and prospects is for a Braceworks enabled structural member tool and object, separate from the architectural version.<br/>
<br/>
The existing structural member tool is not really usable for rigging work for a number of reasons<br/>
 * Complexity-<br/>
 ** the current tool has a vast and confusing array of options and settings most of which are not necessary for entertainment rigging workflows. This makes it intimidating to new users and difficult to use even for experienced users.<br/>
 ** many of the options and settings require the user to be familiar with architectural workflows, which to entertainment users tend to be very difficult to understand<br/>
 * Performance<br/>
 ** the structural member object has a big impact on performance compared to other Spotlight objects. It is bad enough that if a user tries to use structural members to model the rigging grid of a typical medium sized venue the file will be almost unusable.<br/>
 * poor insertion/connection-<br/>
 ** It can be very difficult to get structural members to connect together correctly, when trying to create a rigging grid, especially if  diagonal connections are required<br/>
 ** it doesn&#39;t follow standard entertainment practice of defining the trim height as the bottom of the object, it measure from the middle<br/>
 * no Braceworks support-<br/>
 ** hoists can&#39;t be connected to them<br/>
 ** The user can&#39;t use the insert drop command or the insert connection tool with them<br/>
 ** they do not react to any loads acting on them. This can is a major problem for most rigging designers as many if not most venues provide the roof/rigging in the format of load per distance for example the Columbia Halle in Berlin have a load capacity above the stage of 500kg per 3.5m.<br/>
 ** if a structural member is moved or reshaped bridles and rigging points related to the structural member do not remain connected <br/>
<br/>
The lack of a Braceworks enabled structural member is significantly reducing the potential for selling Braceworks to both venues and rigging companies, since to do the calculation they will have to invest in &#39;professional&#39; structural engineering analysis application like SCIA on top of Spotlight and Braceworks.<br/>

<br/>
Placing motors on structural beams works fine. Nevertheless, I notice that structural beams aren&#39;t designed for Braceworks.<br/>
<br/>
Below some enhancements for a future updated structural member:<br/>
<br/>
- Structural beam that will not need house points<br/>
- Structural beam were multiple bridles and straights can not be place on exact the same location on the beam (with auto insertion mode). I know the workaround with multiple house points, but that&#39;s just not what you want.<br/>
- Option to auto connect a single hoist (straight) to a structural member.<br/>
-It is highly recommended to have a structural beam element which can transfer the reaction forces from bridles and straight drops towards the node points of the structural framework of the building. In this case you could evaluate the total occuring load at the node point of the building (in 90% of the time these allowable node loads are known and provided by the building owner). It is not necessary to create a structural beam element which will be calculated on strength and stability by itselves, that can be done in separate software by a structural engineer.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will try to explain the best i can, but i will also provide a file with drawings and pictures to make it easier.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to enhance the stair construction tool in TIMBER as the existing one does not create the timber stairs properly, specially the winders.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the current tool is working in a similar way as other construction methods and it shouldn&#39;t be this way. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How the winders work in real life (UK standards, but i believe it should be very similar to other countries, also i will be using the metric system). <br/>
<br/>
The winders have the centre pivot point in the corner post and this corner post is increased to suit. Meaning this corner post is what prevents the winders to have less than 50mm on the shorter end, as if the winders have less people will slip and fall.<br/>
<br/>
(if you look into the file)<br/>
<br/>
There is an attached picture of a proper way to create the winders with simple rules, winder angle is kept to a 30° (for 3 winders the most common used), 45° for one winder, 22,5° for 4 winders.<br/>
<br/>
 - 3 Winders corner post usually 90x90mm with 30° angle from the outside corner of the corner post.<br/>
<br/>
 - 4 Winders Corner post usually 90x90mm with 22,5° angle. from the last straight step before the first winder you add 100mm and you place the corner post (always centered with the Stringer) then from that last step you measure 150mm (from the inside of the stringer) to the outside and that is your centre pivot for the winders (shown in the attached file)<br/>
<br/>
These corner posts are also part of the Handrail of the stair.<br/>
<br/>
So this corner post will be increased in case of needed, but usually it is this corner post that prevents the winder to have less than 50mm. <br/>
<br/>
If you have any queries please let me know, and if i haven&#39;t been too clear with the text i apologise, as english is not my main language.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS. i&#39;ve added this in the TECH-ARCHITECT (if this is not the correct one please change it or let me know so i can try and change to the proper Source)<br/>

 # the new ability to enter or exit a cable path at any point while useful has some unintended consequences,<br/>
 ** cables tend to exit the path in the wrong place unless the user pays close attention to how they are drawing, which slows down their workflow<br/>
 ** if the user is using the auto-insertion option the drawn cable will always try to take the path of least resistance to get to the end point which often means it will exit the cable path or truss system rather than correctly following the path or truss to its target, see VB-181574<br/>
 # When using the cable auto-insertion option there is no way to control which cable path is used if multiple cable paths are available. Changing the class visibility of the paths and or attaching the cable path to the start distributor both make no difference. Instead the cable jump out of the desired path and follow which ever path it calculates as the path of least resistance (shortest). This behavior makes the auto-insertion option very difficult to use in larger files that have multiple cable paths and very specific routes the cable have to follow.<br/>
<br/>
I think all of these issues could be resolved by adding an option to the cable preferences to control whether auto-inserted cables can enter or leave a cable path anywhere but at the ends and a modifier key (such as holding shift (could be any key)) to the cable tool itself to allow the cable to enter or exit the path at any point rather that that being the default behavior.

<br/>
In short: When a symbol is inside a pio, and the geometry of the symbol definition gets adjusted, the pio get&#39;s a notification. When you do the same with a slab inside a pio, when the slab style gets adjusted, the pio is not notified.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For our tool, the thickness of the slab is added to the wall hole. So when that thickness of the slab style gets changed, we want the wall hole to be changed too, but we don&#39;t receive a recalculate thus we can&#39;t adjust our WallHole group.

_{color:#505f79}Hi,{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}I’ve been looking into this since my previous email.{color}_ <br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}I have attached our standard drawing issue sheet (created in excel) and the closest representation of this using the Project Revision History function in Title Block Manager &gt; Worksheets.{color}_ <br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}Below are a few questions I have following using the PRH function:{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}- Is there a way of setting up the worksheet so that the Company Name, address etc. are automatically input into the worksheet? I guess similar to creating a style in Vectorworks?{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}- Is there a way of adding additional columns? In our case we’d like a column to show the scale of the drawing{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}- Can Vectorworks search for multiple cells and represent them in a single box? I ask because our Revision and Status Codes are set up to reflect the BIM working standards and in our title block manager the Revision (P) and Status (S) are located in separate cells. They would need combining to match how we currently set up our drawing issue sheet{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}- I assume the distribution section would be input manually or can this be automated too?{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}I can forward you the file I have been working from if you would like to see how we have set up our title blocks to comply with BIM standards.{color}_<br/>
 _{color:#505f79}{color}_ <br/>
_{color:#505f79}Look forward to hearing from you.{color}_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_{color:#505f79}Alex Finch{color}_<br/>
 <br/>
Adding the company name etc is not a problem we have told them how to do that<br/>
 <br/>
However Adding columns or changing formulas seems ot then throw off the results for column G onwards.<br/>
 <br/>
I know that we can get a cell to add different fields together too but this also seems to make it unhappy.<br/>

It would get a much more prominent place in the workspace and it&#39;s something everyone would benefit from.<br/>
<br/>
For the landscape workflow, the absolutely easiest way of working is to draw things with polygons, Polylines, circles, rectangles etc. and them convert them to hardscape and landscape areas when you get to the design development stage.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the command is very hidden and many users never find the command, even for the landscape area where you have the bucket mode for the tool (which does the same thing).<br/>
<br/>
This wouldn&#39;t require a change for users who like to draw directly with the parametric tools, but it would make more people aware of the fantastic workflow they&#39;re missing.<br/>
<br/>
We could still have it available from by right-clicking as well, if users would prefer do access it that way.<br/>

Part of that tool is the &#39;pickup&#39; mode. Unfortunately this function only pickup the used texture of another face but not the mapping overrides like rotation or scale. Would be a timesaver if we can also pickup this information and use that for texturing other faces._&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My comment: A possible solution is to add a Tool Preference for the Texture Tool, with toggles to enable/disable mapping attributes picking for the Pick Up mode.

Advanced rendering artists who might not be a fan of AO are also more likely to know how to turn it off when not wanted. Defaults should instead cater to average users and look the best they can out of the box.

This thought comes from the desire to turn off dozens of classes at once after importing a drawing. Being able to select a large group of objects and turning off those classes would be much faster than using the visibility tool on one item at a time.

Of course, they can use VW Viewer, but it is a separate program and e.g. copying and pasting between Viewer and VW is not possible. <br/>
<br/>
Currently it is possible to open a file as a copy when it is in use by another person. A notification shows up which says that “The file is currently in use by XYZ on xyz-pc. Do you want to open a copy of the file with a new name?”<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to implement a notification which would ask: “Do you want to open the original file or a copy?” (Or similar).<br/>
<br/>
In this way the person does not block the actual editor of the project if he/she temporarily doesn’t hat the file open.<br/>

This is a bit odd considering Sheet Layers have been the preferred method of laying out sheets for well over a decade, and average users don&#39;t utilize this Design Layer page boundary.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the grey boundary acts like a screen plane object (despite screen plane otherwise being deprecated/disabled by default in 2022) and is often obtrusive in 3D views. When this happens, many users just assume it&#39;s a &quot;dumb Vectorworks thing&quot; that&#39;s always there on the screen. I say &quot;why not turn it off?&quot; They say &quot;I don&#39;t even know what it is.&quot; This is all-too common, particularly since the Quick Pref button to turn it off is hidden by default.<br/>
<br/>
The only change should be that the display of the Design Layer page boundary is off by default. Longtime users with legacy workflows should know how to turn it on if needed.

<br/>
 <br/>
 # The Clip Cube faces that are nearly face on with the viewing direction in an orthographic view are nearly impossible to push/pull because the resize code is not special cased.  This task will allow such faces to be pushed/pulled by dragging the mouse up to push away and down to pull toward the viewer.<br/>
 # The Clip Cube faces that point away from the viewer cannot be selected to push/pull because the resize code is not special cased.  This task will allow the back face to be selectable so it can be pushed/pulled without the user having to change the 3D view first.<br/>
The CC resize code will check if the CTRL key is held down.  While CTRL is held down the furthest face under the mouse cursor will highlight instead of the closest.  Clicking while CTRL is held down will select the furthest face to be resized.<br/>

I choose to keep my User Folder on Dropbox, rather than in the default hidden Library directory, so after completing the Migration Manager I always have to go into VW Preferences and manually choose the folder I migrated everything to. This could be streamlined.

Since those creating scripts often are not software developers we need measures to prevent scripts from crashing the Vectorworks application as a whole. To do that we suggest sandboxing scripts running in Vectorworks, so that running scripts either stop and pop out an error message or allow the user to stop them after starting them. As a side effect this would also mitigate issues to some degree touched on in wishes such as Script cancellation button or Background script jobs.

<br/>
It would be great if the Attribute Mapping tool allowed the user to more intuitively map a face&#39;s texture _right on_ the textured face. Currently when the AM tool is activated for a face, the interface is fairly unpredictable and seems to provide an &quot;offset&quot; or &quot;remote&quot; AM &quot;resizing box&quot; with which to work. This is confusing to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recorded my attempts with the AM tool along with some commentary and questions. (I&#39;m using 2022 Release candidate 2, build 614272)<br/>
<br/>
If I am missing the way to get the AM tool to work more intuitively on an individually textured face, please just let me know. Thanks!

If worksheet has a function to get number of component like &quot;GetNumberOfComponent&quot; or &quot;NumberOfComponent&quot;, customers can make Data Tag Style and their workflow should be streamlined.<br/>
<br/>
e.g.)<br/>
#WS_ComponentName(NumberOfComponent)# : To get interior finishing<br/>
#WS_ComponentName(NumberOfComponent-1)# : To get interior furring

A) We need a quick hotkey that enable and disables creased edges/vertices temporarily. Where that enabling it, creases everything and disabling it smooths only what was previously smooth, not everything.<br/>
B) We need the ability to Crease/Smooth a selection of vertices, edges, and/or faces, rather than just ALL.

To get to the window of interest the user must double click on the associated Snap button. The popup Help feedback employed to facilitate this choice is somewhat slow to use and only addresses one button at a time.<br/>
<br/>
In prior versions of VW, the user could double click on any of the Snapping Buttons (or keyboard shortcuts) to open the SmartCursor Settings dialogue. On the left of the dialogue were the 7 categories listed by name. It was very easy to select the setting pane of interest to make changes, or view the current settings. <br/>
<br/>
That ease of use no longer exists and if the user opens the wrong window he/she must click on another button until the proper window opens. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Desired behavior. Retain the SmartCursor Settings dialogue in the Legacy settings of the Workspace Editor. The default can be to have it disabled, as is currently the case, but for those that have spent decades using this program such as I have, being able to get to UI items such as this is a huge timesaver compared to having to relearn a less than desirable new system.<br/>

 # Elements external to structure<br/>
 # Structure<br/>
 # Elements internal to structure<br/>
<br/>
The reasons being:<br/>
 # When we model complex walls/slabs/roof objects the automatic connections between these objects are just too opaque and prone to error. Separating them makes it much easier to make and maintain constructionally correct connections.<br/>
 # It also becomes easier to coordinate with the structural engineer. For instance it becomes very straightforward to isolate and export one&#39;s own structural model.<br/>
<br/>
You can model in this way now but it&#39;s messy because you have to manually manage the position of multiple walls/roofs/slabs instead of one.<br/>
<br/>
One way to solve this might be some kind of parallel wall, roof and slab connection, so that we can &quot;magnetically&quot; snap walls together in parallel, roof faces together in parallel, and maybe slabs (but to a lesser extent).<br/>
<br/>
These parallel connections would work across layers. And—unlike Grouped objects—we&#39;d be able to make standard joins with other wall/roof/slab objects, independently for each object connected in parallel. When you move objects connected in parallel they all move together but their connections with other objects are maintained. When you insert an object (e.g. window, roof light) they&#39;re inserted through all objects at once.

1) The position of the new snapping buttons is restrictive. I find the location undesirable. The buttons cannot be placed on a second monitor. It also conflicts with the Dock (mac only) when moving the cursor close to the bottom of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
2) The icons are arranged in a awkward pattern compared to the way I was used to looking at the Snapping Palette from earlier versions of VW. I can no longer tell which snaps are set at a glance and must focus on the actual icon to figure it out. Much, much slower than before.<br/>
<br/>
3) The icons are smaller than they were in earlier versions of VW, which makes them harder to see for people with aging eyes. See attached picture.<br/>

4) The icons are less distinct than they were in earlier versions of VW. The line art is thinner and there is no use of color as there was previously. See attached picture.<br/>

<br/>
A user wanted to be able to set the fill of a part of a Custom Line Style from the attributes palette. But the fill can only be set by editing the Custom Line Style and editing the objects. He only wants a single line style and fill color in all Custom Line Styles.<br/>
<br/>
But I am sure there are other people who rely on the fact that they can set different parts of Custom Line Styles to different colors/fills.<br/>
<br/>
I believe there should be an additional Attribute Type, similar to By Class, called something like By Parent. If this attribute type was selected for an object, then that object would use the same attributes as its parent object. If the attributes of the parent were changed in the Attributes Palette, then the By Parent object would change as well.<br/>
<br/>
This would allow for the best of both worlds. The person who started the thread could have a Custom Line Style where all parts would respond to changes in the Attributes Palette, while others, could give parts individual attributes or By Class attributes.<br/>
<br/>
This change should apply to all objects in &quot;Container&quot;/&quot;Parent&quot; objects such as PIOs, Symbols, Groups, etc.

 <br/>
<br/>
When deleting classes attached to objects, the pop-up aks if you want to reassign the objects. It would be a nice feature if you are able to see what the deleted objects will be with the class (even within symbols). Maybe even to be able to select them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please see a little bit of backstory;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes during drawing, some new classes appear. To clean my classes list I delete them and reassign, or give them a prefix / correct name.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, sometimes there are very strange named classes and I don&#39;t even know to which object it&#39;s connected to. Therefor it would be nice to see that in a summery of what object have these classes. Even within groups and symbols.<br/>

Ideally, the user would be able to specify an additional rotation, or a normal rotation at the top of Object Info, and the tag would maintain that additional rotation.

VGM will accumulate higher LODs over time but it never evicts geometry to free space for more relevant objects.  This task enables VGM to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Eviction has been attempted several times but proved difficult due the the streaming and threaded nature of VGM.  This task describes a simple implementation to achieve VGM geometry eviction:<br/>
{noformat}<br/>
&lt;more work here&gt;  timestamp octnodes when they are rendered<br/>
Timebox the eviction process <br/>
  RenderScene can look through the sorted list of least-recently-used octnodes and determine if it is appropriate to evict.  If so then<br/>
    (timebox) loop over each meshpart and, if safe, build a changelist of Deletes for the mesh&#39;s GO (check that a mesh-part of the object is not being tessellated or otherwise being used)<br/>
    append an AddObject change to the changelist to have the object re-added – which will be streamed back in when the view frustum passes over it again {noformat}

This could potentially frustrate users if they don&#39;t know why the tool isn&#39;t working on a certain shape so I recommend that an alert is needed when the shape is not compatible with the mode.  <br/>

Currently when using the speaker tool, you could rotate a speaker only by one axe. It would be great if you also can tilt it the other way.<br/>

<br/>
If this is possible you are able to rotate it it in to a floor monitor. Now I have to make a duplicate symbol to rotate the speaker to the correct position.

At the moment to adjust an aisle, you have to edit the profile instead of being a polygon to edit the vertices. A work around is clipping and adding surfaces, but you actually want to double click on the surface to adjust it immediately.

<br/>
During these times I often switch programs, and usually screens to work on other things. I end up having to switch back to VW relatively often to see if the prices has completed.<br/>
<br/>
It would be useful for VW to provide user notifications that a long process has completed.<br/>
<br/>
Options should include bouncing the icon in the Dock and a user selectable alert sounds.<br/>
<br/>
The time a task takes before these alerts occur should be user selectable.<br/>
<br/>
Why is this important? My top priority for today is to import some very large STEP models and convert a copy to polygons to make a 2D file for a preliminary layout. The STEP import took about 20 minutes. The Convert Copy to Polygons is taking about 30 minutes. I keep checking back because I need to get this done, but a watched pot never boils. If VW would just tell me that it is available after being locked out of user interaction for more than 1 or 2 minutes I could focus more on my other tasks without constantly checking back on VW.

2 observations:<br/>
<br/>
1)  The SV objects are rotated incorrectly relative to the referenced objects (the fixture at the bottom of the circle in the original geometry should be at the bottom of the circle in the SV.)<br/>
<br/>
2)  The expected Insertion Point of the SV does not meet expectation.  Instead of the center of the SV objects, the Insertion Point is that of one of the Symbols referenced by the SV.<br/>
<br/>
This was originally reported as bug 181804.  The response was that this is WAD.  There are multiple problems with this:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Using the Insertion Point of one of the Symbols in the System for the Insertion Point of the SV is not intuitive.  While the SV assemble can be moved, this is unnecessary work for the user.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The initial rotation of the elements in the SV is not intuitive.  While the rotation can be adjusted...<br/>
 * This is unnecessary work for the user.<br/>
 * As this is not at-all intuitive, the user can easily miss the fact that the rotation is not what was expected and the error may not be seen until on-site during construction and could result in expensive re-builds and delays.<br/>
 * Even if the user catches the rotation problem, he/she could easily choose an incorrect reference when adjusting the SV rotation, again introducing an error that may not be seen until on-site during construction and could result in expensive re-builds and delays.

Simply making the active color a higher contrast to the inactive color is all that is needed.  Since the Play and Record button are both used to start and stop these action, knowing that the button is ON or OFF with a quick glance would be very helpful.

See also attached images of a couple of examples of the kind of fencing where this is needed.<br/>
<br/>
The workaround I&#39;ve used in the past is to use Posts for the vertical elements and Frame Bars for the horizontal elements, and then model the posts separately.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing needed is the ability to fix the bar spacing to a specific figure. At the moment we can only provide a &quot;maximum&quot; spacing dimension; which means the only way currently to fix the spacing to a specific figure is to make the railing an exact increment of the &#39;maximum&#39; figure.

I have a DWG from a user which when imported into Vectorworks the viewports arent correct.<br/>

Please see DWG and VW files attached. <br/>
<br/>
Im not sure if this is the viewport crops shifting or the drawing is shifting when imported. However i cant get it to import correctly. <br/>
<br/>
When viewed in DWG viewer all seems ok. <br/>
<br/>
DWG was created in AutoCad 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to take a look at the file? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks and Best Wishes <br/>

<br/>
After transferring from working in archicad for 5 years to being a newbie in vectorworks, there are many &quot;features&quot; I miss. I am trying to outline the most important ones that would speed up my workflow. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Publishing - this was integrated in the overview palet - similar to the navigation menu in VW. Here there was first the model (in scale 1:1 - another thing I miss), saved views (in scale) similar to layers, only layers were dealt with separately in archicad, layouting (similar to view layers), and finally a publisher. They layouts could be grouped ( ! ) and were linked to the saved views. These groups could further be linked to the publisher and be automatically updated once changed in the layout set (! ). In VW I feel you need to make the same change about 5 places in order to cover it, something that encourages a very linear workflow which I am not used to. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In my previous office we expected very last minute changes, therefore the &quot;bim method&quot; of setting up drawings and publisher sets were vital in early stages of the process in order to speed up - and open up for - changes in the later stages. I really miss this and feel it should be possible in archicad through minor changes in your interface and script. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask clarifying questions,

<br/>
When a user edits saved view seeking to add particular classes or layers to a drawing for example let&#39;s assume that its an Ent drawing and they want any lighting to be visible on that  saved view. <br/>
<br/>
Presently the user has to individually search each class in turn and make it visible.<br/>
<br/>
It would be much quicker if the user can select a filter, Maybe it could also auto update. If a user assigns a new class to a filter or names the class meeting the filters criteria then it would then automatically update itself in the saved view.<br/>

The user after changing the sheet size or the orientation notices that the Drawing Stamp and the North Point stay in the same position. That implies the necessity of moving those two objects afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
It would be great to implement an improvement, in a form of a check box for example that would say – move the Drawing Stamp/North Point when changing the sheet size/orientation and override the X and Y positions.

Vectorworks already has an excellent focus point tool. It is disappointing that the user cannot easily export a graphical image of how a lighting device is focussed from within Vectorworks.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This same behavior should work Everywhere that a Class list exists (or Sheet Layer or Design Layer or...) Having to hit Enter or Return then &quot;fixes&quot; the search and you have to start over if your subset wasn&#39;t small enough of if the class name does not exist (cause you typed it wrong/misspelled)<br/>

It would be nice to have the possibility to control the axes at Import OBJ. From my point of view a preview would be nice, but if a customer always import OBF-Files form the same source the possibility to control the axes would be sufficient.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays the event industry makes a lot of use of the MVR functionality, which is a great feature. Besides, complete rigs exporting in MVR will take a lot of time to generate the file. Work around for this is separate layer exports.<br/>
<br/>
Would cloud export be an option for this? Is this technically possible? It would a great to have this feature in order you can still maintain your work.<br/>

<br/>
Right now Enscape&#39;s Assets can&#39;t be scaled <br/>
For the particular case of tree assets, scaling can help to obtain more natural renders with Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Normally when using a lot of trees one of the methods used is to scale the trees in almost a close to normal size, 0.8 to 1.2 factor, while rotating them.<br/>
<br/>
Attached are some images of trees rendered using the beforementioned procedure.<br/>

See below. (Currently they are hoping to achieve the workflow using ODBC, but would MUCH prefer to not have that amount of overhead to make such data management possible) <br/>
<br/>
_Hi Neil,_<br/>
<br/>
_I’ve attached a PDF of a recent project where we had done interior elevations and finish plans. In the drawings I’ve referenced finish material specs on a worksheet. This worksheets were imported directly from Excel (Excel example also attached), which is what our interior decorator uses to source materials, and also to help the client keep track of budget and what to order. As our clients, decorator, and builder do not have vectorworks, we rely on Excel spreadsheets for material tracking, which I then update on the drawings. This involves me having the excel and the drawing file open, and simultaneously updating both._<br/>
<br/>
_Here are a few things I’m hoping to achieve using OBDC workflow:_<br/>
 * _Automated excel spreadsheets and VW worksheets_<br/>
 * _To attach record formats to objects and hatches for data fields that will populate the worksheets_<br/>
 * _For example, hatches are used to indicate tile and flooring styles in the finish plans. Each hatch would have data fields that include, style, colour, manufacturer, qty amts, etc._<br/>
 * _Ideally we would be able to attach the record format to a hatch style, or at the least, to be able to attach to rectangles and polygons that have a hatch_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * _The use of a data tag, or material image to reference the materials styles from the drawing to the worksheet._<br/>
 * _In the drawing example, I used and detail marker with a number, but it is not automated._<br/>
<br/>
_I hope that is clear. If I can get this feature functioning for us, I’m sure I would a lot more uses for it._

<br/>
 <br/>
We have requests from customers want to participate in a new Swiss Architecture Competition organized by HALTER (important local company). It is mandatory to deliver IFC4 files. Otherwise you cannot participate. Fortunately IFC4 becomes better and better but the work-flow how to deliver a multi building IFC4 competition project in Vectorworks is currently impossible.<br/>
 Well, to be honest, „impossible“ is not the right word :) It is possible but it is complex, error prone and some regressions between IFC2x3 and IFC4 makes it really difficult to handle and need a huge effort. This is too expensive for a competition. You should keep in mind that an architect do often not get money for a competition. Therefore you should get a result without a big hassle and customer are using simplified work-flow to reach this.<br/>
 <br/>
Vectorworks is the perfect tool to do competitions and supports everything needed. Unfortunately it fails when it comes to IFC export because some of the work-flows do not support IFC very well. We want to avoid that customers switch to ArchiCAD (using Hotlinks) in a competition. This is our/Vectorworks domain!!<br/>
 However, Vectorworks is very close to offer a straight forward solution but these „annoying“ issues in the work-flow drives people crazy.<br/>
 <br/>
I would like to share the attached work-flow movie and files which clearly shows what customers want to do in early phases of the project. The movie actually shows two different challenges/requirements:<br/>
1. Using viewports as repetitive storey and/or building in IFC export<br/>
2. Using referenced viewports as repetitive storey and/or building in IFC expor*t*<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s important to understand that we talk about early phases of a project. We think that Vectorworks need a &quot;official way&quot; how repetitive units/storeys and multiple buildings should be handled. But the work-flow shown in the movie would solve the need to a lot of customers in early phases of a project.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry about the quality of the movie.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
PS: BTW, this is a standard work-flow and we discuss this a lot with customers. What is new is that IFC4 is mandatory.

<br/>
In the real world shim gaps in architecture are not air gaps but rather they&#39;re filled with something. Usually a mixture of polyurethane foam, expanding foam tape and/or silicone.<br/>
<br/>
In Vectorworks the shim gap is just a clear gap and there are some situations where that causes a problem:<br/>
 # It creates a see-through gap in rendered views that doesn&#39;t exist in reality<br/>
 # It means we can&#39;t dimension to the rough opening of windows unless they&#39;re inserted into a wall.<br/>
 # And with the new Wall Closure feature in v2022 there&#39;s a conflict with the workarounds I use for the two problems above.<br/>
<br/>
h3. 1. See-through gap<br/>
<br/>
In rendered views of a 3D model, but particularly elevation views, there is literally a gap around windows that you can see through. This is a problem for obvious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
h3. 2. Inability to dimension to rough opening<br/>
<br/>
This is a problem for us in the following use case:<br/>
 * We include window elevations on our window schedules, by laying out all the window styles on a design layer and rendering them. They&#39;re not inserted into walls, because it&#39;s a lot easier to lay them out without being in walls.<br/>
 * We then need to dimension them to the rough openings but we can&#39;t because the shim gap doesn&#39;t show unless they&#39;re inserted into a wall.<br/>
<br/>
h3. 3. Workaround (and conflict with new feature in v2022)<br/>
<br/>
One way I&#39;ve found to work around the above problems is to create an Interior Trim that is 0.5 mm thick and the width of the jamb + the shim gap. This creates an object that closes the shim gap in 3D without appearing in plan view and also gives us something to dimension to when a window is not inserted into a wall.<br/>
<br/>
The problem as of v2022 is that we also want to use the new Interior Profile Offset feature of Wall Closures (_Plug-in Object Style Options &gt; Wall Closure Profile Offsets_) to show plasterboard wrapping around into the window. But we can&#39;t have both an Interior Trim and an Interior Profile Offset. It&#39;s one or the other.  <br/>
<br/>
The new wall closure feature obviously closes of the gap visually (dealing with issue 1) but we&#39;re then we&#39;re left with problem 2 still, unable to dimension to the rough opening of a window unless it&#39;s inserted into a wall.

 <br/>
<br/>
2022 added new georeferencing options when importing Images. However, these options are always enabled even when no geo data is present in the image.  <br/>
<br/>
When I see these options enabled I erroneously assume there must be geo data in the image, and then I (needlessly) sit and contemplate which option I&#39;m supposed to choose... And I assume most users, like me, aren&#39;t GIS exports nor interact with georeferencing much.<br/>
<br/>
It would be less confusing if the Georeferencing portion of the dialog box were greyed out when no geo data is present. That way it&#39;s unobtrusive when not relevant.

<br/>
 You have to produce different plants depending on where you are in the project – high detail plants for visualisations, light simple 3D geometry for IFC export. At the moment, the only way to do this is to either produce two sets of plants (NOT a good solution) or setting up all plants with both 3D geometry and image prop and separate them with classes. This leads to a lot of ‘turning on and off classes’ depending on what you want to produce.<br/>
<br/>
 At the moment, you can turn off plant details in 2D via View &gt; Show &gt; Show or hide plant details. It would be good to have the same system for 3D – a central switch for what’s visible in the file.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe have a few _very_ simple generic solids for perennials/grasses/ferns etc. as well as what we have today for trees, that are automatically assigned depending on Category, _or_ that you could choose from in the plant preferences when placing the plants (or later via the OIP). The ability for manual override of the assigned geometry would be good.<br/>
<br/>
 This would also be useful for elevations and sectional elevations, as you today can’t use hidden line on image props, and we don&#39;t have the ability for 2D front/side views for plants. However, the main use would be for the 3D model, not for output of drawings.

This will bring up rapidly only the 16 options for Maryland vs the hundreds of worldwide values. This will save a lot of frustration while waiting for this to load.

Reshaping by dragging a marquee around certain vertices of a 2D polygon:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-08-13-14-40-24-461.png!<br/>
<br/>
The desire is to be able to edit objects such as solid additions/subtractions and do the same:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-08-13-14-41-23-748.png!<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the only ways that the user has found to get the desired results are cumbersome and time consuming. Either he:<br/>
<br/>
1) uses the split tool to &quot;chop up&quot; the object he would like to adjust, moves certain parts of it, then creates new solids and add them to the modified original<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
2) digs down into the history of the object until he finally reaches the added/subtracted solids and then move them the distance he needs. THEN he must also dig down further to the original object, modify that so it is the right size to receive the subsequent modifications, and then emerge from the object&#39;s history.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these methods is very graceful. It sounds like, effectively, he would like to be able to do &quot;direct modelling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And just to get a sense of the nature of this request, this user is not seeking a &quot;shortcut&quot; because he doesn&#39;t want to put in the work. He will do what is needed to get his model made (see image below), he would simply like to be able to adjust a single 3D modelled object like he can with a 2D polygon.<br/>

A new bool VGM::IMeshData::ShowBackfaces() = 0 could be added as a way to pass the information to VGM<br/>

This task does not address fixing all meshes in VW such that they are wound correctly.  That would be a separate, more difficult task.

For editing page-based symbols help states:<br/>
----<br/>
_When editing page-based (green) symbols from the drawing area, the scale of the *symbol editing window is set to 1:1* so that the symbol definition is the same size as the symbol instance, for ease of editing. The active layer scale cannot be changed from the *document context menu* while in the symbol editing mode. This is an exception for page-based symbols only. Due to the scale adjustment, other objects that are not part of the symbol definition are not snappable unless they are also at a 1:1 scale in the active layer._<br/>
----<br/>
Even the help text only mentions the _*document context menu*_ and not the view bar.<br/>

It shouldn&#39;t be possible to change the active layer scale in the view bar, when editing page-based symbols.

A user should not have to drag the cursor all the way to a distant corner of the screen. It should be floating by user preference, and resizable. In 2022 the only option for  semblance of floating Snaps Palette is to customize  Smart Options Display, and substitute Snaps in one of the quadrants. This is a poor substitute for what has been a feature of the program for as long as I recall (MiniCAD+ 4). I urge engineering to return to the old Snaps Palette before releasing 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of this forced dock, allow users to rearrange the individual snaps within the palette as they prefer. For example, for decades the snaps have mapped to the QWER-ASDF keys (recently F was reassigned by default to Launch Quick Search by default; in my workspace I map Edge Snaps back to F and use / for Launch Quick Search). Rotate a physical qwerty keyboard 90° clockwise and these keys map to the vertical 2x4 arrangement of snaps. But it was never possible to reshape palette to a horizontal 4x2 arrangement and keep the mapped relationship to the QWER-ASDF keys; the snaps would cascade into a fixed order that is not user-editable. If users could rearrange the icons they could have a palette that maps to QWER-ASD(F), This keyboard visual aid would help users learn and use snaps more effectively and work faster and more accurately.<br/>

Example: Have the top component be able to change material depending on the floor finishes type rather than creating multiple slabs to achieve this.<br/>
<br/>
Currently the only way to do this is to create multiple slabs for each different floor type there is. This also effects the transition of the ceiling of the floor below since there are multiple slabs that show a seem. If this was continuous it would be more accurate for construction drawings as well as in renderings. <br/>
<br/>
Example: I have one floor with three different finishes. (tile, hardwood and carpet.) the request would be to just have the top or bottom component change rather than placing multiple different slabs which would not be realistic in a real project. <br/>
<br/>
This is a critical component for an interior designer &amp; architect to be able to create realistic technical drawings while also achieving the correct visual representation while rendering.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached two images below. One of a space plan indicating which rooms would have a different floor finish and why it would be important that this is one slab. The other showing the placement of two slabs showing different materials when this really should be one with the top component changing depending on the extents of the room.

<br/>
For example within the plant tool, users are always confused if they&#39;re making a change to the style or to the instance. If all style dialogues had (for example) a green tint or border instead of the standard, our users would very quickly learn to associate the colour with &#39;style&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
This works very well with the &#39;edit yellow border&#39; we already have.<br/>

<br/>
Besides the reported bug VSS-127182 these two none features prevents architects from using Vectorworks and need to do part of their work on the old 2013 Autodesk Design Review or a license of AutoCAD in order to Sign (with the Portuguese ID card and an USB ID card reader) and to place multiple VW Sheet layers into a single DWFx file. If/When Autodesk removes the download of Autodesk 2013 Design Review. All of our users will be forced to purchase an Autocad license in order to sign their DWFx files.<br/>
<br/>
The text bug reported in VSS-127182 should be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to export multiple VW sheet layers into a single DWF or DWFx file could be implemented in the publish command options, just like what happens with pdfs.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to digitally sign a DWF or DWFx could be implemented in an option inside de publish options dialog box. You can find out more here: [https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/web/guest/assinatura-digital/assinatura-digital-qualificada]<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure that long time VWX users have all plenty of personal and custom librairies. That&#39;s right for me, I&#39;m a VWX user since Vectorworks 8 and have thousands of symbols of our Novelty event equipment stock. <br/>
<br/>
Version after version, it&#39;s difficult to keep a correct and functionnal library with all changes that are not specifically documented. Like others users I think, I really need for each version :<br/>
 * new implanted database records, their fields and the correct units to feed them if necessary, can we write the unit inside if it&#39;s text fiel and is this units count?, ...<br/>
 * changes on previous records (maybe some field must have change, transform from text fiel to number field, or removed fields; or added fields, ...)<br/>
 * new implanted classes in plug-ins (for me all spotlight tools)<br/>
 * removed classes<br/>
 * complete list of removed and added menu commands and tools<br/>
 * and when online libraries are updated, it will be wonderful if we could have a list of changed symbols. So, if we customize some of them in our personal libraries, we could check and make the changes if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to listen to my request ;)<br/>
<br/>
If possible, could VSS custumers have access to those changes since  3 ou 4 last versions ? If those changes are documented somewher.

<br/>
I&#39;m sure this request has be demand before...<br/>
<br/>
It will be great to have adjustable towers in height. And greater to have possibility to attach hoist between truss and top tower.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I create special tower with special height each time I need them, that&#39;s a job to do each time and could be upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
I construct towers like a truss corner and customize 3D height each time. See my example.

<br/>
We need another option between these, such as &quot;Very Low&quot; which would smooth it out somewhat, but not as much as Low does.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the attached image, where I&#39;m trying to trace an image of a rough stone edge. The polyline on the left was drawn with No Smoothing - it looks fine but has 161 vertices which is absurdly high. The polyline on the right was drawn with Low smoothing - it&#39;s already too simplified and only has 9 vertices.<br/>
<br/>
In this scenario I should be able to get a good-looking shape with the Freehand tool that has 20-40 vertices.<br/>
<br/>
For now I&#39;ll just use the Polyline tool and trace it manually but it&#39;s so much more clicking...

These new fly-out windows are not only a refreshing update to the UI but they also do not partially vanish off-screen when the attributes palette is located near the lower edge of the user&#39;s screen (which is a common place to put it.)<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, other attribute aspects are still accesses via the older style drop*down* menu. (i.e fill type, pen type, line thickness, markers). These menus not only obscure the attributes palette itself but more importantly partially vanish off-screen when the attributes palette is near the lower edge of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
In order to improve UI and UX consistency it would be preferable to have the older dropdown menus reworked to be the new fly-out windows.<br/>

It would be nice if the Slab Drainage Tool could create a Record Format with some values, for example:<br/>

 * Minimum Slope<br/>
 * Total of Drainages<br/>
 * Average height of the components with a grade<br/>

When importing an object, like obj, it may come in out-of-view making it look like the import failed.  Presumably users will want to see the object they just brought in next so this task does a fit-to-view after import completes successfully for all imports.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively this task proposes a Vectorworks Preference -&gt; Display -&gt; fit to objects after import that is on by default<br/>
<br/>
 Users may want more from an import:<br/>
 * import a thing and I want to place it (either center it at next click, or put file origin at next click)<br/>
 * import a thing leave coordinates exactly as they are in the file<br/>
 * import a thing and re-orient the coordinate system to match VWs (Z up vs. Y up, Left handed system vs Right handed)<br/>
 * import a thing and then focus the view onto it<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Completive analysis by Shengxi :<br/>
 *SketchUp* * Import a 2D/3D DWG file: fit to object after import, place object at origin<br/>
 * Import other file (SKP/3DS/Image file) : activate the insertion mode (specify insertion point on click)<br/>
<br/>
*AutoCAD* * Import a PDF (2D) file: fit to object after import, place object at origin<br/>
 * Import a 3DS (3D) file: will NOT fit to object after import, place object at origin<br/>
 * Import an image file/referenced file:<br/>
<br/>
 * activate the insertion mode (specify insertion point on click)<br/>
 * allow manual coordinate input for insertion<br/>
<br/>
*REVIT* * Import CAD/SKP/3DM file: provide choices during file import:<br/>
 * Auto - Center to Center, (will not fit to object after import)<br/>
 * Auto - Origin to Origin, (will not fit to object after import)<br/>
 * Manual - Origin, (specify insertion point on click)<br/>
 * Manual - Center, (specify insertion point on click)<br/>
<br/>
 * Import an image file: activate the insertion mode (specify insertion point on click)<br/>

Users are provided text and progress feedback in the status bar area but it has some limitations. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the progress is overridden too quickly by a new action and user doesn&#39;t have time to read the message.<br/>
<br/>
It may be useful for users to look back in the log to remember what they had done earlier.  A historical log would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it may be useful for users to know how long operations took so they could diagnose performance issues better.<br/>

This task proposes to upgrade the status control on the status bar to provide a history that is saved with the file, a clear history button, and timestamps on status that has progress.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One implementation is that when the status bar message is first set a timer is started.  When the status changes again a time diff is calculated and that first message is added to the log with the time delta, assuming the message is not empty.  This technique automatically captures scenarios where the text message changes as the progress advances<br/>

<br/>
It would be great to be able to get spot heights for the wall, relative to the site model surface and also from the base of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
If this would be a stake, the ability to decide between full height and from site model would be great.<br/>
<br/>
If it was built into the wall tool itself, maybe a choice of getting a (full) height at each vertex? <br/>
<br/>
You can use the dimension tool but it becomes cumbersome to get it exact.<br/>
<br/>
To be able to measure height over ground for a wall is very important, especially when designing retaining walls - there are strict regulations for how tall the wall can be before you need a structural engineer to draw it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to use the bench mark, but it gives the true heights (so if the ground level is at 42.2m and the wall 2m, the bench mark would show 44.2m. It&#39;s not either useful to use the control point mode, as the control point would have to move for each point of measure (as the ground is undulating (At least, I haven&#39;t got it to work -there might be a way I haven&#39;t found)

 <br/>
{color:#000000}I manage 47 VWX licences on server licence with about 100 users. I provide them all librairies, templates, workspace, specially design for our society and job.{color}<br/>
 <br/>
{color:#000000}To do that I use google drive, with a shared folder, and every users just have to put this folder in &quot;Workgroup folder&quot;.{color}<br/>
 <br/>
{color:#000000}Everything works fine (librairies in favorite, templates, workspace) except my AudioToolSetData.xml. This file is in the right folder in the drive/workgroup folder, but Speaker and SpeakerArray tools aren&#39;t able to read this file in workgroup folder.{color}<br/>
 <br/>
{color:#000000}{color:#000000}To complete my investigations : If I select the workgroup folder as my user folder, then AudioToolSetData.xml works fine with Speaker and SpeakerArray tools.{color}{color}<br/>
But it is not a valid solution because this shared workgroup folder is write only (in google drive) for my users, I’m the only permit to write symbols, librairies, templates, …<br/>
And if users can’t write in their user’s folder, it might create problems...<br/>
 <br/>
Could you permit Speaker and SpeakerArray tools to read in the workgroup folders ?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your support.

This task gives flash and a modern upgrade and sense of quality and performance to Vectorworks.  In Vectorworks 2022 a single mousewheel tick jumps the view in or out by some amount.   This task would have that view change animated over some small time period.  the animation can be interrupted by a subsequent interactive navigation.  When that happens the view jumps instantly to the final frame of the previous animation and starts a new smooth transition.<br/>
<br/>
a new checkbox labeled &quot;zoom animation transition&quot; will control this new feature located in display preferences below view transition animation checkbox.  Alternatively, these 2 checkboxes can be grouped under &quot;transition animation&quot; with &quot;saved view&quot; and &quot;zoom&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
This task introduces a new VCS command to generate LOD files from any sized point cloud files:  <br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-07-21-14-40-21-932.png!<br/>
<br/>
This Generate LODs command generates many lod files.  Each lod file references points in the original file (one implementation) and occupies a partition of space.  The order of the points in the LOD file are such that reading half of the file gets a nice uniformly distributed half-resolution set of points for that partition.  For example,<br/>
{noformat}<br/>
 bunny.pts -&gt;<br/>
    bunny_1.ptslod<br/>
    bunny_2.ptslod<br/>
    …<br/>
    bunny_&lt;partition of space number&gt;.ptslod{noformat}<br/>
example of ptslod file:<br/>
{noformat}<br/>
 bunny_1_1000.ptslod -&gt;<br/>
    2342<br/>
    2811<br/>
    3081<br/>
    4198<br/>
    8811<br/>
    9010<br/>
    …<br/>
    &lt;byte offset into the pts file&gt;<br/>
    …<br/>
    &lt;min x y z&gt;  &lt;max x y z&gt;   &lt;number of points referenced in this file&gt;{noformat}<br/>
each entry (point) is a uint64 or 8 bytes vs 27 bytes per point in the binary pts file.  Alternatively, the file offsets could be diffs and encoded with variable number of bytes to further reduce filesize:<br/>
{noformat}<br/>
  0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF      &lt;--- delimiter- next byte sets the size of offsets<br/>
  8                       &lt;--- offsets are 8 bytes until next delimiter<br/>
  23432112                &lt;--- indexing &#39;current offset&#39; += 23432112<br/>
  0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br/>
  1<br/>
  34                      &lt;--- indexing &#39;current offset&#39; += 52<br/>
  52<br/>
  34<br/>
  200<br/>
  198<br/>
  0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br/>
  4<br/>
  8372<br/>
  4872<br/>
  ....{noformat}<br/>
Alternatively, the file could contain the position and color of each point (larger file size, faster load time)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Pseudocode for Generate LODs is as follows:<br/>
{noformat}<br/>
void main(ptsFile, minPointsPerLeaf, maxPointsPerLeaf)<br/>
  // make the root LOD file, which just indexes every point in the ptsFile<br/>
  // the LOD file has the extents and count of number of points at the file end<br/>
  file rootLODFile;<br/>
  minP, maxP, numPoints<br/>
  for_each point in ptsFile<br/>
    rootLODFile &lt;&lt; byteOffset;<br/>
    minP = min(minP, point)   maxP = max(maxP, point)<br/>
    numPoints++<br/>
<br/>
  // put useful info at the end of the file<br/>
  rootLODFile &lt;&lt; minP &lt;&lt; maxP &lt;&lt; numPoints<br/>
  SubDivideOrDecimate(numPoints, ptsFile, rootLODFile, minPointsPerLeaf, maxPointsPerLeafNode);<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
void SubDivideOrDecimate(numPoints, ptsFile, lodFile, minPointsPerLeaf, maxPointsPerLeafNode)<br/>
  // either subdivide this octnode into 8 more LOD files or <br/>
  // build decimated versions of this octnode file <br/>
  if( numPoints &gt; maxPointsPerLeaf)<br/>
    SubDivide(ptsFile, lodFile, minPointsPerLeaf, maxPointsPerLeaf);<br/>
  else<br/>
    Decimate(ptsFile, lodFile, minPointsPerLeaf)<br/>
 <br/>
void SubDivide(ptsFile, lodFile, <br/>
          minPointsPerLeaf, maxPointsPerLeaf)      // make 8 new files-- octnode children of &#39;lodFile&#39;<br/>
  file childrenLOD[8];<br/>
  size_t childrenNumPoints[8];<br/>
  minMaxP = readAtEndOfFile(lodFile)<br/>
  for_each offset in lodFile<br/>
    p = ReadPointFromPtsFileAt(ptsFile, offset)<br/>
    index = ComputeChildIndex(p, minMaxP)<br/>
    childrenLOD[index] &lt;&lt; byteOffset;<br/>
    childrenNumPoints[index]++<br/>
  for_i 0 to 7<br/>
    childrenLOD[i] &lt;&lt; this_ones_min_and_max &lt;&lt; childrenNumPoints[i]<br/>
    childrenLOD[i].CloseFile<br/>
  for_i 0 to 7<br/>
    SubDivideOrDecimate(numPoints[i], ptsFile, childrenLOD[i], minPointsPerLeaf,  maxPointsPerLeaf)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
void Decimate(ptsFile, lodFile, minPointsPerLeaf)<br/>
  numPoints = numberOfPointsInlodFile(lodFile)<br/>
  PointCloud cloud;<br/>
  for each point in lodFile<br/>
    cloud.Insert(&lt;point, byteOffset&gt;)    // this calculates a score for each point maybe<br/>
  create decimatedFile<br/>
  for each sorted point in cloud<br/>
    // &lt;insert code to do diff and variable-byte-length offset&gt;<br/>
    decimatedFile &lt;&lt; point.absoluteByteOffset<br/>
    decimatedFile &lt;&lt; minAndMaxOfLodFile(lodFile) &lt;&lt; halfNumPoints{noformat}<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The PointCloud import will look for .ptslod files and if found then they will be shown in the new &quot;LOD files&#39;&#39; field on the OIP.  Entries in the LOD files can be multi-selected and their partitions of space made more/less dense together by pressing the up/down buttons.  Also, partitions of space will be visualized in the drawing when selected:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-07-21-14-47-44-210.png!<br/>
<br/>
A new OIP field will control whether the pts and ptslod files are saved in the VW file or are referenced.  By default, ptslod will be referenced and VW will only save a small cache (10k points) with the file in case the referencing data is misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Q&amp;A:<br/>
 # Can clip cube or isolate points or something better be used to pick desired partitions of space rather than guessing with the list box?<br/>
--yes.  maybe a &#39;select visible cells&#39; button on oip?<br/>
 # How long does the new Generate PointCloud LODs take?<br/>
--a long time, depending on machine availability and number of points<br/>
 # What does the LOD files field say when some of the ptslod files are missing?<br/>
--It shows in red<br/>
 # Do the references show in the references tab on the navigator palette:<br/>
--yes

We can work around this by right clicking and Edit, so that&#39;s the best workaround.<br/>

<br/>
We should switch that to the Data Tag. This means that the DWG import will create Data Tags instead of symbols.<br/>
<br/>
The Data Tag gives the user a much more intuitive and flexible handling than the &quot;old&quot; system with text added to database. Also, the Data Tag provides more options for the alignment of text. Currently the user needs to decide if the look or the link of the text will be preserved when importing a DWG. With the usage of much more flexible Data Tags instead of a symbols we could avoid changing the look while preserving the links of text.<br/>
<br/>
So this options aren&#39;t necessairy anymore.

As a design develops, these profiles can change but editing 5 or 6 EAP objects that represent say the roof gutters is very tedious.<br/>
<br/>
If the EAP command supported the use of symbols, then one would only need to edit the symbol in order to change multiple instances of the EAP objects using that profile.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Specifically can it have another column for DMX footprint. Saying &quot;Fixture ABC123 Mode 12&quot; is partially useful. It would be amazing to also have a column that said DMX footprint 56ch or something. It is sometimes impossible to tell if you are looking at the right mode, when we generally compare DMX footprint to make sure we are right, and match the actual fixture.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Secondly could there be a column that indicated Light Outputting/Emissive? There are a few fixture types that are very taxing so they have been made as both Light outputting and emissive, and having a CLEAR distinction of what the selected fixture mode is would be helpful. And by helpful I mean it really needs to happen haha. I still can&#39;t figure out if there is a TMB solaris flare, in Mode 12 advanced that has light output vs Forced emissive.

First we have some questions:<br/>
 * Are the serialnumbers of Design Express included in the numbers?<br/>
 * The customers who are using the wall tool, are they also using the Design Express Windoor tool? Are those the same customers?<br/>
 * Can we have more detailled information about how a tool is used? What&#39;s the workflow of a tool? Does the user uses the object styles or does he click on the Settings button? Where does he click next, ... <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have a system where we can control ourself what the bigdata is tracking or not? For instance, we can call a function in the sdk or vectorscript code which data should be logged, ... This way we can better figure out the needs of the customers and to which functionality we should focus us. <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not only handy for Design Express only, :) I suppose it would be an added value for every Vectorworks release.

Generating a SDF texture from an image of text can take some time.  Also, the input image (of a sentence, for example) needs to be quite large and that can take some time to generate but the memory can be freed after the conversion.  Generally a 4096x4096 image of text can be transformed into a 128x128 SDF texture with very good upscale quality.  This would eliminate the need for VGM to do text LOD.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
pseudo code for inefficiently generating SDF image from grayscale text image (&gt;0 is &quot;pixel on the letters&#39; and &lt;0 is &quot;not on the letters&quot;):<br/>
<br/>
// for every pixel, find distance to closest edge<br/>
<br/>
for each sdf_xy<br/>
<br/>
normalized_xy = sdf_xy / sdf_wh<br/>
<br/>
sdf[sdf_xy] = SpiralOutward(normalized_xy)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
// find closest distance from &#39;center&#39; to edge.  negative return value<br/>
<br/>
// means center is <br/>
<br/>
SpiralOutward(center)<br/>
<br/>
distance = huge_number<br/>
<br/>
p = center<br/>
<br/>
start_sign = sampleImage(center) &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
while distance == huge_number<br/>
<br/>
end_sign = sampleImage(p) &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1<br/>
<br/>
if start_sign != end_sign<br/>
<br/>
distance = DistanceBetween(center, p) * start_sign<br/>
<br/>
p = SpiralToNextPixel(p)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
return distance<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
sample implementation can be found here //depot/Engineering/VectorWorks/VGM/MainBranch/projects/shipping/tools/SDFTexture/source/SDFTExture.cpp<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Using a compute shader to generate SDF from Image may be a good idea for performance.  While not strictly necessary, one option to reduce processing time on file load is to cache the SDF texture with the text handle it comes from and save it to file.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The process of generating 4k text images and converting them to SDF would likely need to be backgrounded for files that have 10000 text objects in the model.  10000 single color text objects is 128*128*sizeof(float) * 10,000 is 655MB which is an acceptable amount of VRAM to use for text.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Keeping all SDF text at 128x128 resolution has another benefit which is that atlasing becomes trivial.  Atlasing is where a single large texture, 8192x8192 for example, contains 4,096 128x128 sdf tiles and can reduce the number of draw calls which generally improves performance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Q &amp; A<br/>
 # Does VGM generate SDF and have a function to get the image so Core can save it<br/>
--needs thought<br/>
 # Is 128x128 really good enough SDF resolution?<br/>
--need to retest -- i seem to remember 256x256 being fine

This can be implemented in the Core tracking calls to CreateMeshData, e.g., CMeshDataProvider::CreateMeshData.  It could be tracked in a less accurate way by tracking in TRegenerationManager::VGMTessellated.  The graphic could go in a similar location to where the FPS counter shows.

I miss having more flexibility where a symbol only needed to touch or be within the confines of a position to pick up its naming or after &quot;attaching it to a position&quot; you could drag it away without changing its position assignment unless you dragged it to another position.  It seems now that I can&#39;t use auto-position and move the fixtures around once they are attached, except along the position.  While I appreciate having the ability to closely constrain where fixtures are physically attaching to a position it&#39;s now really limiting needed flexibility in top/plan where we are always shifting fixtures around, even just a little bit, to be more visually clear with the presented information rather than completely literal.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking that the auto-position feature needs to add a setting to control how strict the positioning of the fixture symbol is on the position.  Right now I find it unusable so I&#39;m forced to turn it off and manually enter / change position names.

First, VW search is great.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the enhancement is if you select two extrudes and search &quot;Group&quot; to group them, the first option is &quot;Convert to Group&quot; followed by the more popular &quot;Group&quot; but it should be the other way around because &quot;Group&quot; command is a better match for a search of &quot;Group&quot; but also the &quot;Group&quot; command is more popular.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Convert to Group&#39; converts each selected object into a group.  &#39;Group&#39; groups all selected objects into a single group, effectively &#39;grouping&#39; them which is likely more popular.

In the list browser, the Join Capped column uses a combo item with Yes &amp; No answers. If there are only two answers, it would be better to use a checkbox or a multi-state item (like the Core column) (notice the multi-state item could have more than two answers)<br/>

1) open file text-format-no-color.vwx<br/>

Alright, we can change the color through the Attributes Palette, right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes, in case it&#39;s just a text object.<br/>
<br/>
In case of the dimension there is text and there are lines. Changing the color here through the Attribute Palette would change the color of both.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to change any aspect of the text format of the dimension, go into the menu and get the Format Text dialog and it will change the text object inside the dimension accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you create a new or edit an existing Text Style you CAN set or change the color options! <br/>
<br/>
And: you CAN set a certain text style for dimensions!<br/>
<br/>
But: even if you set a certain color in the text style, the dimension will ignore this information.<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look at this.

I&#39;m having lots of crashes lately and I&#39;m finding backups are completely unusable. It seems like every single Solid Addition, Fillet, etc. in the file is invisible upon opening the backup file.<br/>
<br/>
If I have to manually seek out every issue and fix it myself, the backup is almost more hassle than it&#39;s worth, especially with the worry that I may miss an object that needs to be regenerated.<br/>
<br/>
Manual regeneration typically involves finding the invisible object, cutting, then pasting in place. Simple enough - Vectorworks needs to find a way to handle this. I don&#39;t care if it makes the backup file take a bit longer to open.<br/>

See attached screenshots of a backup I just tried to open - the fully modeled kitchen looks like Swiss cheese.

This idea comes from interior design wall finish sheets.  We would like one line in the middle to be the actual wall color specified and the outside stroke line to be black so the line doesn&#39;t disappear when using lighter colors.<br/>

The compound material is &quot;read&quot; by NBS as a _single_ material and as such, only *one* NBS spec section can be associated with a compound material.<br/>
<br/>
The result of this is that any of our wall components that use a Compound Material, such as framing + insulation, cannot be properly connected to NBS info. Unfortunately this affects *most* walls constructed in Canada. As such, the NBS Chorus integration cannot be properly demo&#39;d to a design firm wanting to use the NBS Chorus. <br/>
<br/>
If our team needs assistance with making this correction, I have David Watson of NBS Canada available to assist. Please let me know if this is needed.<br/>
<br/>
If it helps to know for reference, in Revit (I am told by the NBS Canada team), walls with multiple materials in one plane are still reported out to NBS as individual materials and are therefore able to be properly connected to NBS.<br/>
<br/>
We are very much hoping that this can be corrected/improved as soon as possible because presently neither the NBS Canada team nor Vectorworks Canada can fully speak to the integration feature.<br/>

<br/>
As you hover over an object with this tool, it preview highlights in red all the objects on that same class. If I have a large, complicated file, there are bound to be many things on the None class, and if I happen to hover over something on the None, the tool stalls for a while as it tries to interactively highlight every single object on the None class, including things inside groups &amp; symbols. It then stalls a while longer as it tries to de-highlight everything upon moving the cursor away. Because of this, the Visibility tool essentially becomes unusable in large complex files (which ironically is when it&#39;s the most useful).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;d be great to have the option for this tool to ignore the None class, because not only is the stalling quite disruptive (and looks bad when in the middle of screen sharing), but I never intend turn off the None class in the first place. I don&#39;t want to accidentally turn it off with the Visibility tool.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s already a settings button for this tool - so this improvement could simply be a checkbox added in that pop-up which says &quot;Ignore None class&quot;.

The attached video explains the issue. In summary, the grid spacing logic that is applied to the start and end panels is inconsistent with the logic applied to all other panels. The most typical use case for a curtain wall is to have panel of EXACTLY the same width. <br/>
<br/>
A user would therefore expect to be able to set a single panel width value ( in the Vertical Grid Spacing field.) However, due to the strange logic used for creating the Curtain Wall grid, this is not the case.<br/>

<br/>
If you create a viewport Vectorworks set the target sheet layer as active layer and shows the viewport on the sheet layer. In Multiple Views this behaviour is disturbing, because the active View Pane switching to the sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view it would nice to have a checkbox in the &quot;Create Viewport Dialog&quot; to decide if Vectorworks should switch to the Sheet Layer.<br/>

Almost *every* *time* a note needs to be changed, I have to navigate to my local copy of the Database, and switch from absolute to relative path. Note after note. This very time-consuming and annoying. It would be great if by default the Callout would look for the relative rather than absolute Database path. If it already does this, and I&#39;m unaware of the setting, then it needs to be better documented.

If the user use the default cell format &quot;General&quot; he will see a lot more Dezimal Places than he can make visible in the document units. <br/>
<br/>
This possibility leads to the fact that the user sees inaccuracies that he shouldn&#39;t actually see. A good example is  VB-180307<br/>

<br/>
Right now - if there is overlapping geometry - it shows as void in section - like the two objects are canceling each other out. It would be much better if it showed as solid, as this requires inch perfect modeling to get your section to look correct. While as if it showed as solid - it would be so much more tolerant of slight overlapping between walls and floors ect.<br/>

It&#39;s very common for users to begin a new project by duplicating a similar project file that&#39;s already complete.  This allow the user to revise or recreate the model so that the plans, elevations, sections, and details are already organized on sheets.  These files often have several detail drawings taken from various section (or elevation) viewports.  These detail viewports have a lot of drawing graphics and annotation shown within their annotation group.  Many of these details can be reused for the new project but they often need to reference a different viewport because the condition shown in the detail may no longer be seen in the original viewport it was created from.<br/>
<br/>
*Example:* An eave detail viewport was created from Section A but the model has changed so that that condition is no longer seen in Section A.  However, the condition does exist in Section B.  The user wants to select the Detail viewport and change it to reference Section B.  This will then allow him to locate the Detail Callout in Section B where the condition exists and move the annotations within the detail viewport to align.

It&#39;s a very common case in curtain walls in buildings to have a spandrel panel (opaque panel between floors). We need to be able to define this in the Wall Style of the Curtain Wall, along with the grid.<br/>
<br/>
See attached image for example how it would look like and where that would be useful to define. In addition to this it should be good to be able to define a different frame in the Style settings, like for example if there was a protruding fin with greater depth than others.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the frames and panels can be edited with the Edit Curtain Wall tool, but that effectively makes the Wall unstyled. See attached video for a real world example of major UK client that has decided not to use Curtain Walls (and see the workarounds they did) because they have to manually edit all spandrel panels on the building. <br/>
<br/>
Problem is further compounded in that when you edit the Style (for example change gridline spacing), you have two options:<br/>
 * Update Frames and Panels, which won&#39;t reflect the Style edits (won&#39;t change the grid)<br/>
 * Delete and recreate frames and panels, which will lose all of the edits you made to curtain walls to create spandrel panels, because this info is not included in the Wall Style<br/>
<br/>
Frame and Panel settings for individual frames and panels in Wall Style definition would go a long way to making this a more adopted tool suited to modern architecture in which curtain walls are mainstream.<br/>

Sometimes symbol display controls contain previews of the edited objects, very often they contain complex images that are calculated at runtime depending on the current settings.<br/>
Unfortunately, the background of these images is always white by default. But more often we need it to be transparent as white looks inappropriate.<br/>
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to do that. We&#39;re trying to fake a grey background by drawing a grey rectangle behind the other objects in the symbol, but this is not always working. Mac OS uses different shades of gray on the &quot;base level&quot; of a dialog and in group boxes, and Apple uses different colors in different versions of the OS. Not to mention night/dark mode, in which case the background should be black and not gray. So what we need is an additional parameter for UpdateSymbolDisplayControl (or maybe a flag in SymbolImgInfo) to tell VW to draw the symbol on transparent background, i.e. to use the actual background color of the dialog at this very position.<br/>
Please see attached image that shows the problems.

The gridlines on the design layer when displayed in the vp show the bubble location further away from the model with longer grid lines.<br/>

I explained to the user he can adjust his gridlines and bubble location in the annotations of the viewport.  User came back with that works until he changes the scale again of the viewport.<br/>

This looks to be WAD, I think the user needs to choose a scale for his viewport and adjust his grid lines accordingly. I submitted this as an enhancement perhaps that it could behave better if you tweak the vp scale?<br/>

Both should reflect what type of drawing is being created.<br/>
<br/>
So:<br/>

 * If an Elevation Viewport is created the _Viewport Name_ should be _Elevation-x_ and the _Viewport Title_ should be  _[Drawing Title] Elevation_. (Using Front, Right, Back, and Left as appropriate). <br/>

 * If an isometric Viewport is created the _Viewport Name_ should be _Isometric-x_ and the _Viewport Title_ should be _[Drawing Title] Isometric_.<br/>
 * If a perspective Viewport is created the the _Viewport Name_ should be _Perspective-x_ and the _Viewport Title_ should be _Perspective [Drawing Title]_.<br/>
 * If a custom view Viewport is created the _Viewport Name_ should be _Custom View-x_ and the _Viewport Title_ should be _Custom View [Drawing Title]_.<br/>
 * If Internal Elevation Viewports are created the _Viewport Names_ should be _Internal Elevation-x1, Internal Elevation x2, etc._ and the _Viewport Titles_ should be _Internal Elevation_ _x1, Internal Elevation x2, etc_.<br/>
 * If a horizontal section Viewport is created the _Viewport Name_ should be _Horizontal Section-x_ and the _Viewport Title_ should be _Horizontal Section_ _[Drawing Title]_.<br/>
<br/>
The program knows what type of view is being created so why not leverage that into clever Viewport naming and Viewport Titling thereby saving users time.<br/>
<br/>
I know some won&#39;t want this but it could be a Document Preference.  <br/>
<br/>
There also needs to be a preference for the Drawing Title to be:<br/>
 * lower case<br/>
 * UPPER CASE<br/>
 * Title Caps<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Wanted to talk about one thing which is a very big pain and we actually have quite a lot of calls about this problem in Technical Support. Palette positions. <br/>
<br/>
 Most of the time we get calls due to a couple of reasons:<br/>
 # Users have a messy interface. They just move floating palettes on the go getting frustrated that some palettes block parts of their design layer. <br/>
 # Undocks a specific palette from either Object Info or Navigation and looses it. (there is a separate option for that i know but sometimes i just want to dock everything back into default places with all palettes)<br/>
 # Sometimes in rare occasions they get graphics corrupted on palettes and we need to either reset the workspace (ask the to recreate it) or reset whole user folder.<br/>
<br/>
We could save quite a lot of time if we could have a button to &quot;Reset all palettes&quot; or dock all palettes. Ideally palette size would be restarted as well maybe the whole palette cache could be restarted, if we have a user that has a very unique interface its complicated to reset those palette positions without completely dissecting the user folder files. We get calls in technical support quite often with palettes not being visible or not opening up properly. I have a couple of cases where palettes would completely fail to open on specific workspaces forcing us to ask users to recreate workspaces.

<br/>
It would be great if Vectorworks could take over the mapping for classes from a pio in the data manager: A kind of import function for class mapping from a pio mapping.<br/>
<br/>
It is common for BIM projects to map according to classes. The effort to have the identical mapping as with the PIO is very great. At the moment we are copying the mapping together in the XML file outside of Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
I could also imagine a function that permanently links the mapping of a class with that of a PIO. Changes would then be made in both places at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Marc

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have just started using the beta version of VW22 and already missing the shortcuts I had assigned in VW21. I have managed to set most of them (such as rotate, move, measure) however, rotate plan doesnt seem to be controlled in this pallette - where can i manage this key? (and why is it not transferred from VW21 - it was standard there, so i had no idea it was found in view - rotate plan)<br/>
<br/>
I hope there is a quick fix to this issue. I use this command a lot.

Its possible its because its a beta licence? but really it should give me the same experience as uk customer, and if it is then they definitely want metric by default (as will pretty much everywhere outside the US)

<br/>
Because the old hotkeys for snaps could be better deployed elsewhere, is it possible that the double-click access to Snap settings could be deployed in the Smart Options display iteration of the snapping palette?<br/>

They can be seen in the attached Vectorworks file but I will summarize below too:<br/>
 * The grouping of object type, style name, plug-in style/instance settings, and edit drawing label layout at the top of the drawing label dialog is good and should be the same for all smart markers.<br/>
 * In some cases, &quot;edit marker &#39;layout&quot; should be moved up to appear after &quot;plug-in style/instance settings&quot;.<br/>
 * Drawing title, drawing number, and sheet number are a sensible, consistent grouping (expect for the interior elevation marker where it makes sense to list the sheet number after the 4 available drawing numbers.)<br/>
 * Marker scale factor makes sense to have towards the bottom and three of the five smart markers dialogs already have this setting at the bottom<br/>
<br/>
These adjustments will help improve tool consistency and adoption by users. <br/>

Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
Currently, if I right-click on a lighting device this is the list of commands available to me.<br/>
<br/>
Can I suggest some sort of consolidation of Spotlight commands in this context. This is currently not really possible in the Workspace editor and although I can get an approximation of what it should be, it would be really handy to have all the Spotlight commands in one place within this menu.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately a separate flyout modal like the ones that have been added to the Attributes Palette and the Snapping palette would be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is important for all sorts of reasons to do with ergonomics, but the most important reason given the current push for clarity for newcomers is to let users know that these commands exist here in the first place. Some of these commands (new selection commands for instance) are only available from this menu and are not in the Workspace Editor.

Therefore PNGs with transparency lose that transparency. It would be preferred to have the alpha channel preserved/enabled when _pasting_ a PNG into Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
In contrast, dragging &amp; dropping or importing a PNG provides the option to &quot;import alpha channel&quot; and does preserve transparency of a PNG.<br/>
<br/>
This will help expedite workflows where individual images are prepared in external apps and then the page layout is done within Vectorworks. Currently user would need to export a PNG from the external app and then drag &amp; drop or import the PNG into Vectorworks. This may be fine for a small number of images, but as the number of images increases, this becomes quite a chore. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a video showing a captured PNG that contains an alpha channel and what happens when pasting it into Vectorworks and another graphics application (Affinity Photo). It  shows that the copy &amp; pasted PNG contains the alpha channel but we don&#39;t seem to be enabling it when pasted into Vectorworks.<br/>

<br/>
This could simply be fixed by the the semicolon being automatically added to the end of the text box, just like the degree mark is automatically added when you hit enter.<br/>

So you could type [15] [enter] [45] [enter] for example.<br/>

Not sure what was the reason why we have disabled this function (or rather made it conditional on the checkbox) for Surface based Materials.<br/>
Also, when default Materials were created, not sure what was the decision to assign them either selection based on. What we ended up with is that certain Materials won&#39;t report Volume at all, and certain Materials won&#39;t report Surface at all, until a user checks the box.<br/>
<br/>
Embodied Carbon Calculator we’ve been working on recently requires volumes of Materials, and I&#39;m considering to advise anyone using the calculator to check Report as Volume for all Materials manually which is not great.<br/>
<br/>
This would in essence remove the need for a checkbox and enable both Surfaces and Volumes to always be calculated. <br/>

<br/>
a. After and Before a row<br/>
b. After and Before column<br/>
<br/>
2. At the moment when the user inserts a column or a row breaks the workflow because the new row(s) or column(s) is inserted &quot;before&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
3. The user can indeed select the corresponding cell in a way that the new element is placed accordingly but as other programs like Numbers or Excel have the option, that&#39;s not the user&#39;s preliminary choice. Even in this solution for the last row or column, there&#39;s no way to insert a column or row after the last one. These new insertion modes will solve that problem.<br/>

<br/>
I would love to see snapping sets, where like saved views, users can save snapping toggles and/or options into a saved set. A single keystroke (or pair of keystrokes for forwards and backwards) would toggle the snapping sets, allowing fast access to frequent snaps with limited keyboard real estate.<br/>
<br/>
This would also assist teachers and trainers in demonstrating the importance of good snapping habits by having new users save a few snapping sets and showing how each set is applicable to specific tasks, as well as the importance of returning to the default snap configuration after performing certain specialized tasks.

<br/>
As we discussed it on Slack, apart from the fact that the Tabbed Document command is not included in the BCG DLL of a few languages, we didn&#39;t manage to active this command either.<br/>
We wonder if it would be better to remove it or at least find out how to activate it.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In Vision it is currently not possible to select a network adapter on which the DMX signal is sent. This is what our customers often want. You could also use it to work around the bug VB-171465<br/>
 Is it possible to integrate this in VISION?<br/>

<br/>
When the Lighting Pipe Ladder tool inserts a Ladder into the drawing area, the Ladder object is inserted using the *Centre* of the object instead. This is confusing as it is not clear where the insertion point of the object is.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to suggest that the *Align Left/Centre/Right modes* are added to this tool in the same way that they have been instigated in the Lighting Pipe Tool. <br/>
<br/>
Another confusing aspect of the tool is the &quot;pre-rolled&quot; nature of the inserted object. This causes much confusion when users create *Schematic Views*. I would like to suggest that the *Vertical Mode* is also added so that the Lighting Pipe Ladder tool follows the methodology of the Lighting Pipe tool in a much clearer fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>

<br/>
Whenever there is a part that doesn&#39;t have a texture, the phrase &quot;No texture&quot; should be used instead of &quot;None.&quot; Even as an experienced user I was confused trying to figure out why my Overall was somehow assigned to the None class even though my object was on another class? The &quot;By Class&quot; icon further accentuated this confusion. Then I realized the word None was referring to the [lack of] texture assignment.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks would be a lot less confusing if terminology across the program was considered holistically. Because the &quot;None&quot; class is such a prevalent and important concept, don&#39;t use the word &quot;None&quot; in other contexts where the two could be conflated. In this case, please change the texturing window to say &quot;No texture&quot; or something similar.<br/>

There are currently many ways to attach Data, but the primary function there is an automated Schedule, and/or automated specification &amp; calculation data.<br/>
<br/>
IFC does not appear to offer a universal field for this primary callout.<br/>

The Wall Style Data tab in &quot;description&quot; does offer something in this way (only for walls), but currently the method of using a Data Tag to display this is awkward and cumbersome.

<br/>
All the Wall components have Brick&amp;Mortar compound material assigned to them, meaning simple Brick material does not exist in my model except for being part of compound material. Which means that in a worksheet where I want to do a QTO and work out a cost for brick wall, I need volume of compound Brick&amp;Mortar and Material Cost property of Brick simple material. Also if I want to add something like component thickness, that would need to be for compound material, since no component actually has simple brick material.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem would be even more pronounced in 2022 when Subpart reporting will be showing component Materials, then any Material properties for those will not return a result. <br/>
<br/>
I would propose enabling compound materials to display values for Material properties for the simple Material that is selected as &#39;Show&#39; in the dialogue.<br/>

And if nested Pop Overs will be possible lateron in later versions, we can still expand, but for now, the not nested, not popup controls supporting version of a Pop Over would help us a lot!

We do know that we can accomplisch this be creating our own tool, or even overwrite the Reshape Tool, but as mentioned, this means that after selecting the object, the user needs to switch to another tool and that&#39;s just a loss of time.

<br/>
I would actually expect that Data Tags would first look at the horizontal alignment of a text block, then look at the constraints, so that a center-aligned text block with left/right constraints would first insert by center, then reset the object bounds left and right, such that a container object would appropriately expend to fit the center-aligned text block.<br/>

<br/>
Currently, the default palette option is Active document. To a new user, the means to access a wider array of colors is often not obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Because palettes add alphabetically, the first option below Active is the 8 bit Classic Vectorworks colors, so new users will often select this option, when this palette is mainly here for reverse compatibility.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend making Standard Vectorworks Colors the default palette and not including the Classic palette.<br/>
<br/>
I could also see moving the Manage Color Palettes button from the top-right to a full-width button below the color palette choices, which would help reinforce the connection between that button and the available list at the bottom of the palette.

I would advocate for Data Tags to be true hybrid objects when attached to a hybrid object, with a duplicate of the geometry in screen and layer plane. That would allow the tag to match the Z height in 3D views while also behaving like screen plane text in top/plan.

This is also similar to word processors, where changing one part of the format puts &quot;+&quot; next to the style name to indicate an override but still otherwise maintains the style reference.<br/>
<br/>
One usage case would be bolding specific words while still wanting the font and size to be consistent across styled objects. Another example would be setting the background fill to none for certain text blocks. (The latter is currently possible, but any edit to the text style will revert those adjustments)

In addition, it only picks up white, the user with another colour in the background as no way of removing that fill. <br/>

They would have to take this into Photoshop to remove the excess white background and add a transparency layer whereas programmes such as Powoerpitn are able to allow the user to draw around the area they want to remove from the image.

Could the same function be added to remove all the 2D geometry from the Lighting Pipe plug-in object?  This would be incredibly useful when the Lighting Pipe object is used inside a Hanging Position or 3d Symbol. This would remove the need to use the *Convert to Group* command which disables any of the plug-in functionality.<br/>

<br/>
This is very useful for example if they import a situation from a DWG/DXF and then they only need a part of the imported objects. Another useful case is, that they realize that they have objects in the drawing that are too far away from the rest of the drawing / internal origin.<br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround for this but it doesn&#39;t meet all the requirements.<br/>
 * Currently the desired objects can be selected<br/>
 * The command Invert Selection can be called<br/>
 * Now the unnecessary objects can be deleted<br/>
<br/>
This workaround needs a lot of clicks, also all layers have to be visible and the objects should be editable.<br/>
<br/>
There is another workaround with the Clip Tool. But also with this tool all layers have to be visible and all objects on all layers need to be selected.<br/>
<br/>
In our opinion it would be the best place to add this functionality to the Purge command. There it is already possible to delete objects outside the Page Boundaries. The Export Image File has the possibility to draw a Marquee that will be used as a boundary for the export. A similar option could be added to the Purge dialog, where a boundary/marquee can be drawn. You will find a suggestion in the attachments.

<br/>
I propose the tile/line editting environments should disallow class use and force a classid of 0 on the geometry.  This should have no bearing on the user&#39;s ability to modify direct attributes (color, weight, opacity) where allowed.  At draw time, the class of the individual tile/line sub-objects would be ignored. Visibility would be governed by the layer object and its class.<br/>
<br/>
In cases of paste of by-class objects into the geometry, the attributes could be copied and baked into un-classed geometry.  Translation could do the same.<br/>

Here&#39;s a smattering of randomly chosen bugs related to this topic. They span 16.0 to 27.0 and almost all are still open. These changes would resolve all of these issues and inconsistencies.<br/>

Sometimes this can be done using classes and layers, but other times using this method creates a huge blowout in the class and/or layer list and overly complicates the drawing organisation.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently we have been using a simple record attached to objects to designate the stage that that component belongs to. We then use the criteria based Vectorscript Show() or Hide() procedures to temporarily show or hide geometry. This works very well with Revit export (export visible objects only), but does not work with IFC export with the same option selected.<br/>
<br/>
This VE is a request to have IFC export recognise criteria based visibility.<br/>

<br/>
This already exists online and is what I use to develop palettes that match but have to create each color in a time consuming way.  A large number of architects, myself included, are horrible with selecting colors.  Hence why this would ease their workflow and allow for greater control of presentation styles.<br/>
<br/>
Look here for the web based idea:<br/>
<br/>
[https://coolors.co/]<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of options to expand upon this (i.e. build palettes around manufacturer specific paint colors, fabric swatches, carpet colors, etc.) but it should be a simple add in the first go around.  Possibly consider a partner link that live links Vectorworks to the Coolors webpage and directly imports the color codes into the user&#39;s palette.

This results in situations like the attached screenshot, where there are a lot of groups, symbols, etc. stacked near each other it is makes it a harder to read.

<br/>
Production electricians need two ways to assign universes to ports. The first, which is currently supported, is to pre-plan universes for each fixture, and then assign the universe to the node to correspond to the connected fixtures.<br/>
<br/>
The other strategy is to assign universes based on position and unit type. To support this, distributors need the option of a universe to be specified to each port, and for fixtures connecting to that port to adopt that universe.<br/>

When objects are added outside a crop, drawing labels need to be constantly adjusted. Aligning the drawing label to the crop object would save a ton of time and clicks.<br/>
<br/>
To implement:<br/>
<br/>
1, Add check box to OIP (under the Crop Visible checkbox) to Link Label to crop? Checking the box reveals the standard 2D placement grid.<br/>
<br/>
2. Add the options to the Create Viewport Dialog with the option to add the Drawing Label.<br/>

Several our Customers complain that they can&#39;t have the gross area of wall components. I mean: there is a Worksheet function that gives the wall material area without opening surfaces (CompAreayName); but you can&#39;t have the gross area of a wall component that can be important in computation processes. Our Customers sustain that it could be useful even a function that gives height of a component and one that gives length of a component. This way it could be possible to get the area. Please what do you think about?

Another increasingly common scenario would be a system set up for LED fixtures, with hot power run from a PD. The user should be able to connect a Lighting Device to a distributer and have the breaker ID populate the dimmer/hot power field.<br/>

In both cases, moving the lighting device would result to connecting to a new dimmer or breaker in the new location. The power ID stays with the cable, not the Lighting Device.

<br/>
More options for window trim.  They would like the capability to better control the trim &amp; sill components. Particularly, they&#39;d like to be able to have multiple trim components in the same window.  i.e. The bottom 1/3rd could be stone with the top 2/3rd as wood.<br/>
<br/>
They would like to be able to have Wall types/styles as a 3d graphic symbol<br/>
<br/>
Better opportunity to create 3d symbols for standardized bathrooms that they use on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
There is not have enough control of sheet numbering when issuing revisions or supplementing sheets in a set.<br/>
<br/>
The curtain wall tool is cumbersome. Would like to more easily be able to divide frame members equally. Easier editing capabilities are needed as the current workflow is difficult to move and precisely set frames. <br/>
<br/>
Better integration of incorporating drawings &amp; graphics directly into worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
Would like to ensure the integrity of hyperlinks to outside resources.  Meaning, there could be a way to show graphically reflect that a hyperlink is broken (much like when a viewport needs to be updated).<br/>
<br/>
They miss the Bluebeam integration on their Macs. Still works on iPads. They would like to see a mark-up feature in Vwx.<br/>
<br/>
Stair railings need a better wrap/return function to walls or around corners.  They don&#39;t currently have the ability to draw railings as they actually need to be built.<br/>
<br/>
Need a better way to create ceilings other than solid modeling or creating another slab.  They want more of a ceiling tool.

<br/>
The specific issue is that in the US it is now standard practice to have cable stickers that include the length of the part on every cable in a run or loom. Currently because both the used parts sum and the used parts total fields of the cable object can contain multiple parts it is not possible to directly extract this information from the cable object. Previously this was relatively easy since each part had its own column/field.<br/>
<br/>
Russell suggested 2 possible solutions that would solve this issue from his point of view<br/>
 # add options in the cable report command to display the cable run id and loom id associated with a part (in the group by pane)<br/>
 # having a way to display each part inside a cable object separately in worksheets rather than being grouped together<br/>
<br/>
I have attached an example of Russell&#39;s standard cable sticker and Loom list that he uses based on a modified version of the original cable tools

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Spaces have Zone Types and then the user can pick one option for each zone type. But the user is not required to pick an option for any zone type.<br/>
<br/>
In Visualizations the option for accessing Zones is Assigned Zone 1 to Assigned Zone 5. But this means that the same Zone Type could be a different Assigned Zone depending on the number of Zones assigned to an object.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So if you have three Zone types, HVAC, Security, and Signage and you want to use visualization to identify all spaces that require signage, you could need to use Assigned Zone 3 (for Spaces that have both HVAC and Security), Assigned Zone 2 (for Spaces that don&#39;t have either HVAC or Security), or Assigned Zone 1 (for Spaces that that have neither HVAC or Security).<br/>
<br/>
It would be more useful to be able to specify a Zone Name (including wildcards and Contains/Begins/End With) which could be used to more directly specify the Zone (including subsets of a Zone Type) rather than having to assign &quot;dummy&quot; Zones to get the Assigned Zone into the correct location. <br/>
<br/>
Assigning &quot;dummy&quot; Zones is likely to cause other reporting problems or extra work arounds to generate fully correct data and reports.<br/>

<br/>
A command to make a unique duplicate of an existing symbol, that can be used while working on a design layer or sheet layer. That is, the user would not have to open the Resource Manager and duplicate a symbol as this takes them out of of their design flow.<br/>
<br/>
The way it would work is like this:<br/>
<br/>
1) Select an existing symbol that has been used on a design layer or sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
2) Right-click on the symbol and choose &quot;Make unique symbol&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3) A pop-up would appear prompting the user to adjust the name of the new symbol. &quot;-2&quot; would be appended as a suffix by default.<br/>
<br/>
4) After clicking &lt;ok&gt; for the pop-up above, the duplicated symbol would be the one in place on the layer.<br/>

It would be nice, if working on plan details you can click in &quot;Rotate Plan&quot; and a dialog opens to click on a self-defined angle. After working with that temporarily angle the next click in this dialog should bring you back to the previous angle.

<br/>
When we use the geolocate tool and link the user origin to the georeferencing coordinate system, we would like a small change in behaviour to stop someone inadvertently changing the user origin.<br/>
<br/>
Current behaviour...<br/>
<br/>
Once we have set the user origin to match the georeferencing coordinate system and then return to the user origin dialog there is nothing to tell you that the origin is so linked, and also, unless by a quirk of fate, the user origin defined in the &#39;relative to internal origin&#39; dialog is not the same as the actual origin set.<br/>
<br/>
Desired behaviour<br/>
<br/>
Once set using the &#39;match to the georeferencing coordinate system&#39;  button, it should be very difficult for the user to change the user origin.  There should be some sort of warning that the user origin has been set using this method or there should be some sort of mechanism such as having to &#39;de-georeference&#39; design layers before the user origin can be set using a different method.<br/>
<br/>
The origin is such a key part of project setup and coordination that we cannot afford for someone to inadvertently mess it up.

<br/>
Adding a Preview ability (and the associated &quot;preview&quot; button) to the attributes pane of the Advanced Properties dialog for Section Viewports and Interior Elevation Viewports. This ability would function in a similar way as class and layer overrides currently work for Viewports: Adjust settings, use Preview button to confirm that the desired look is achieved which keeping the Adv Prop dialog open, confirm settings and close the Adv Prop dialog using the Ok button.<br/>
<br/>

This would help greatly with adjusting those attributes and seeing the results without having to &quot;ok&quot; the Adv Prop dialog and then having to *re-open* the Adv Prop dialog to make changes.<br/>

<br/>
Many Spotlight objects are connected to each other (due to auto connect and braceworks functions in the background) and when one of these objects is checked out the linked objects do  are also checked out.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that only the primary object get clearly highlighted as being checked not the other secondary objects that are linked to it. This makes it very hard for users to identify whether an object is free and when not who has it checked out.<br/>
<br/>
Highlighting these secondary linked objects and clearly identifying who and why they are checked out to would greatly improve the project sharing workflow for Ent users.

I propose that if the active selection consists only data tags, the tags should maintain their connection to the tagged object when mirrored. A slightly more sophisticated check would be if the distance between the tag and the nearest bounds of the object is the same.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-04-20-16-23-28-396.png!<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if you have two spaces that have dimensions such as in the screenshot below, users (and their clients) are having to switch their &#39;reading&#39; of the space label back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-04-20-16-33-59-933.png!<br/>
<br/>
The standard here, in contrast, is to _always_ have room dimensions displayed either as &quot;width x length&quot; or &quot;length x width&quot; _regardless_ of which dimension is longer. This would result in the Deck above being shown as it currently is and &quot;Reception&#39;s&quot; dims being displayed as 7&#39;8&quot; x 17&#39; 9&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, an option would be added to the space object so that the dims could be calculated and displayed in the order the user wishes, both for the built-in space labels and for data tags.<br/>

<br/>
The ability to be able to add other tool sets from other workspaces to your custom workspace Or the ability to create new tool sets. <br/>

So for example if someone has spotlight and connect Cad. The ability to drag the whole Building tool set to the Connect Cad workspace. Or the ability to create your own custom tool set. <br/>

<br/>
This has a tendency to make plots look untidy when complete and I seldom use this feature because of that. The reason for this is that the precise angles are never exact and more often than not will vary considerably. This makes the 2D representation of the Plot look scrappy and ill-considered.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you could set some *constraint angles* in the same way as you can for the SmartCursor &quot;Angles from Axis&quot; preference then I would use this feature all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it would encourage users to engage with the 3D nature of the light plot much more - especially when pre-visualizing focus and placement of lighting devices.<br/>

If we could add the same icon next to hyperlinks, including an option to only appear if the link is broken. This would be an improvement to the workflow to allow users to avoid finding out only after a selection is made in the OIP. This would aid in finding which Hyperlinks are affected and avoid having to click through each instance to verify or editing links through a worksheet. Thanks

They stock a lot of truss types that we don&#39;t have the Cross section data available for and would like to be able to manage this data, including creating new cross section sets, storing the data in a user or workgroup folder and being able to create their own hierarchical library structure similar to the shipped cross section content.<br/>

Text from SCIA web:<br/>
<br/>
SAF is a neutral, MS Excel-based, file format. It improves collaboration between structural engineers and allows them to easily exchange analysis models between different analysis software. It is practical, simple, and intended to be used in daily practice. Originally a Nemetschek Group initiative, the SAF open format has already been implemented or is in progress by many software providers like: SCIA, Graphisoft, Allplan, RISA, FRILO, Axis VM, Dlubal, Sofistik, IDEA StatiCa and more.<br/>

Fields such as this are available in the Rigging Tools. The Truss Tool particularly has the exact same function, so it strikes me that this would be a neat alignment of functionality between the tools.<br/>

<br/>
Because the Lighting Device is always inserted at the bottom edge of a Truss object, the insertion point is always in the wrong place relative to the Centre of the Truss Chord. This is the case when a Lighting Device is inserted using a C Clamp.<br/>
<br/>
If it were possible to have an offset field where a value could be set, then that would be very helpful and would save the need to offset Lighting devices after insertion.<br/>
<br/>
I guess an alternative way to do this automatically would be in Symbol Options by adding a Rigging Object Z Reference parameter.

<br/>
If you work with Project Sharing and style based objects the workflow to change a style is not good. Example:<br/>
Initial situation: Building with 2 storeys and rooms with one room style <br/>
- Employee 1 checks out all objects on the upper floor. <br/>
- Employee 2 works on the ground floor sees a graphical error in the room style. He now edits the style of the room and can make all changes up to the moment when he wants to close the room with &quot;OK&quot;. Then a dialog appears saying that the changes cannot be made because the rooms on the upper floor have already been checked out by another employee. All changes made to the room style will now be lost. <br/>
 <br/>
Suggestion: &quot;Edit style&quot; checks whether you are working with project sharing and then check out all objects with the same style.<br/>
 <br/>
Best regards, Marc

After placing that focus point in my user folder and choosing it in an open file, the focus point was not displaying correctly, it was just showing the text, not the circle. For the life of me I couldn&#39;t figure out why. Only by trial and error did I realize it was because I had a text style sharing the same name. After deleting that text style and trying to insert a new focus point, it worked correctly. There needs to be some kind of feedback from VW if that conflict exists. If a focus point sharing the name with a resource results in the FP not displaying properly, VW should present a conflict window upon trying to use that focus point and explain why it is not possible.

Currently all geometry is always shown with the full line thickness, regardless of whether the &quot;Zoom Line Thickness&quot; setting is on or off. This can make viewing and interacting with a PDF quite difficult at times.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This could be solved in one of two ways:<br/>
<br/>
-Make the contents of PDFs respond to the &quot;Zoom Line Thickness&quot; setting like all other objects.<br/>
<br/>
-Or, have a checkbox in the PDF&#39;s OIP that says something like &quot;Display lineweights&quot; which could be turned on and off per PDF. (Not sure if this is necessary - I&#39;d personally go with the first option, unless there&#39;s a technical reason for it to be OIP-based).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Video attached showing a PDF in Vectorworks and how messy it looks, versus the ability in Adobe Reader to turn off display of lineweights.<br/>

Many users on multiple displays lose the a palette in behind something or in to the ether between the two displays.  Often when they call in we ask them to disconnect displays, change resolution or have to remote in to go hunting for the hidden palette.<br/>
<br/>
If we had a button to relocate these palettes to the center of the design layer as a &quot;parachute&quot; to help find the missing palettes faster.<br/>
<br/>
In addition if a palette is active but can&#39;t be found, as in some cases it is user error that they docked it and it shrunk, if you could click on the active palette name in the menu and a color change highlight would show you where that palette is docked?

<br/>
Currently when creating drainage in a slab, the drain location gets a default elevation of 0 and the entire slab tips up now raising the slab higher than it was intended / modeled<br/>
<br/>
The user then has to move the slab down in 3D to re-align its edges but the datums listed on the slab are no longer valid or just show information not needed by the designer.<br/>
<br/>
Current workflow is Place Drainage, relocate slab in 3D, associate all text info on the slab to a class that can be turned invisible because it is inaccurate for construction purposes, then annotate over top the true to be built datums and conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed workflow is:<br/>
<br/>
Slab drainage when placed in the slab should leave all edge datums where they were modeled when the slab was first drawn flat.  Any drainage should have the option of raising the insertion point up (To slope to the exterior edges) or probably by default slope the drain insertion point down. (Water would drain from the edges to the drain datum below the top of slab elevation)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In a normal design process, one could have all their slabs modeled and walls in place, perhaps most of the design complete, and then proceed to want to figure out where the slab drainage will go.  Doing so in the current workflow will cause all the slabs to not be set at the correct height any longer, sand would require a lot of fixing after.

<br/>
First of all, in the Automatic Numbering Preferences dialog there are a few options, which are incorrect from a linguistic point of view:<br/>
<br/>
* Prepend target distributor ID to prefix:<br/>
* Prepend source distributor name to prefix:<br/>
* Append brakout ouput ID fo suffix:<br/>
<br/>
* Prepend the system name to the prefix:  (the same syntax is also present in Braceworks)<br/>
<br/>
The original version is really not logical: in general a &quot;prefix&quot; is always first (by nature), so if a prefix is preceded by other elements is not a prefix any more, like this: distributor&#39;s name + prefix.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, &quot;Prepend source distributor name to prefix:&quot; should be rather changed into &quot;Prepend source distributor ID to prefix:&quot;, analogically to the &quot;Prepend target distributor ID to prefix:&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
When needing to edit the initial polyline he started with, it takes *many* double-clicks to dive deep down into the object&#39;s history to reach the polyline.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if we had a way to expose and access (perhaps via a contextual menu command) all levels of history for a 3D modelled object so that the user could reach it easily, just as easily as it currently is to travel all the way back up through the history to the top-level object. This would greatly speed up 3D modelling work for those who have objects will deep histories.<br/>

<br/>
Use case: One person manages the template and resource favourites file for a small firm. They create a shared folder of resources and host it at VCS. They point their own workgroup folder prefs at that folder and do the same for all other users in the firm. That primary user wants all other users to simply be able to _open_ the template for new projects and _pull_ resources from the favourites file but *not* to be able to overwrite the template or add to the favourites file (because they know their co-workers will ignore the warnings we have in place.)<br/>
<br/>
Providing an option for the original host of the files to limit access to read-only would ensure that the sacred template and favourites file could not be disturbed. With us controlling Vectorworks and the location where these files are shared, providing read-only access like this would be a tangible benefit for users to host files at VCS. It would also be a differentiating  feature for using VCS to share files vs other cloud syncing services (which don&#39;t easily, if at all, provide read-only access) or an office-based server (that is often finicky to set for read-only access for specific files).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

<br/>
This is on my opinion described evasively in the documentation: it has to be made more evident that the *first clicked face* of a solid *CANNOT* be tapered.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We somehow intuitively expect to taper that face on first click-drag.<br/>
<br/>
Please open the attached file and try this on the solid:<br/>
 * click on a face you want to taper<br/>
 * drag along the face to define a plane. You think thus to have been setting the pivot through that click and drag, similarly to an angular dimension in Reference Line and Edge mode.<br/>
 * no drag widget appears, ever, on that face and you are left wondering why<br/>

With these filters one could filter objects that are in layers/classes e.g. with the Tag &lt;Construction Phase&gt; or &lt;Design Phase&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
For Tags the following options should be possible: is any, is none, includes, does not include (Include/not is a single tag).<br/>
<br/>
For Description the following options should be possible: Starts with, Ends with, Contains, Is, and all the negative forms<br/>
<br/>
We should also think about how we want to present the tags of resources. It might be a good solution to combine alle tags into one filter &quot;Tag&quot;. The other solution would be to support separate ones for layers vs classes vs resources.<br/>
<br/>
The filter for the Class Tag should also be implementend in the Manage Sequence Dialog for PIOs and Data Tags as basic filter for all objects (Introduced with T02226 - Data Tag Improvements). See attachment.

Hi Misho,<br/>
I did a quick test using IfcElementAssembly with modelled Symbol Wall Hole Component to define the opening. The opening is correct, but I can’t see the contents within the Symbol (Wall and Window). Here are the test files, if you can have a look and tell me if there was something I did wrong, or there is something you need to do to enable this entity to see Symbol content in Ifc export.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Hi Misho, can you please give us an update regarding IfcElementAssembly? We have tested the workflow you suggested when we spoke, but this wasn’t working. Is there something we were doing wrong or does the pset itself need to be adjusted to allow elements inside the Symbol to be shown? Thanks<br/>

Hi Luka,<br/>
I started working on this (symbols as assembly), but I had to stop, as this week is VGDC. Nothing wrong from your side - as I explained, I have to implement an additional case for this workflow. I&#39;ll continue workiong on this next week.<br/>

<br/>
It would be a nice feature when plan rotation of conventional lights listen to Focus - Pan in the OIP, and auto rotate to the same focus position as the 3D part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
 * Rotate in OIP the Pan info to 45*<br/>
 * ETC will be rotated in the 2D version as well instead of custom plan rotation.<br/>
<br/>
It will be very important that this will only work on static lights and not moving lights.<br/>

-&gt; Other options than &quot;All expanded&quot; do not make sense, at least on Mac, because then all quadrants are always displayed with a slight delay. If you want to work fluently with it, you do it to speed up, so you have to get rid of any delay. The fade-in and fade-out of the individual quadrants is already questionable, even if without delay at &quot;All expanded&quot;. This should also be deactivatable (checkbox).<br/>
 <br/>
So to clarify, two wishes:<br/>
1. Delete the delay (shown in video)<br/>
2. Fade in and fade out only if wished (checkbox)<br/>

 <br/>
1. With the methods and views this is quite desirable, since prob. several must be selected/set. But with the tools rather nonsensical.<br/>
 <br/>
2. if it remains already visible, then better all quadrants, because after the selection of a tool I would like to change surely the methods, pointer snap and view settings. But they all disappear. Only the used quadrant remains visible -&gt; nonsensical. Imagine the worflow, where one wanted to change a tool + 2 methods but also the pointer snap settings in the SOD.<br/>
 <br/>
Since 1. and 2. somewhat contradictory, the logical wish would be to be able to set this according to own needs for each quadrant.

<br/>
This is common with designers getting takeoff information on the furniture/window/door objects etc. <br/>
<br/>
A frequently created schedule for interior designers is an FF&amp;E schedule (furniture/fixtures/electrical) and on these schedules is a commonly used field for manufacture URL/website). This allows the designer/buyer/builder and client a quick visual of the actual product. <br/>
<br/>
I am aware of the hyperlink tool however this does not work with worksheets. If I create a  hyperlink within a worksheet, on a sheet layer I am not able to access it as a hyperlink, however, if I export it as a pdf it identifies as a hyperlink. <br/>
<br/>
If I export this worksheet as an excel worksheet, excel does not pick up that it is a hyperlink text, which would give the user more work to manually adjust these as hyperlinks before sending them off. <br/>
<br/>
If I copy and paste an Url on a sheet and export this to a sheet layer, the pdf picks up that this is a hyperlink. <br/>
<br/>
If I import an excel worksheet into Vectorworks, Vectorworks does not recognise that the text is a hyperlink. It also does not bring the text, if the hyperlink was created with formula instead of the hyperlink tool in excel VB-177338, so there are lots of issues with consistency. <br/>
<br/>
The ideal outcome would be to allow hyperlinks to be clickable from the worksheet palette and also transfers to and from Excel. <br/>

We have a separate tool challed &quot;Plangrösse einrichten&quot; (Translation: Plan Size Set Up). This tool has two modes: One to move the page and one to change the size of the page.

Is it an option for you to take over our tool? Or could you implement more functionality in your tool?

It would be great, and quite expected by users, if all of the data (except for the &quot;Description&quot; field) could be read by data visualization. Data visualization itself is fairly easy, and the wall (and roof and slab) style data pane has data that users already enter and would want to visualize, so we really should have a direct connection between the two.<br/>

<br/>
For example, currently we have the AutoTurn Online integration under the AEC menu. After adding Solibri Direct, it appears under the Tools menu. When adding NBS Chorus, it is a script palette. This assortment of locations is confusing to customers and, at face value, makes it looks like we are not considering the placement of these menu items.<br/>
<br/>
In practice, all of these products are Tools and they are part os AEC workflows, so we should decide the one location where they belong and we should put them there. If there is a technical limitation to fully moving the NBS Chorus palette to a different menu location, then we should at least create a menu &quot;alias&quot; that links to the script palette so that we can host NBS Chorus next to AutoTurn and Solibri Direct.<br/>

So the OIP needs an additional parameter that offsets all chairs by a certain distance, for example entering 12&quot; would pull the all the chairs out, perpendicular to the table, by 12&quot;.<br/>

Notice that each OIP has two different fields named &quot;Height&quot; which do different things. The first sets a Z height, and the second corresponds with the vertical dimension of the door/window. The latter makes sense to be named &quot;Height&quot; and is aided by the fact that it&#39;s right next to the &quot;Width&quot; field. So it&#39;s the first &quot;Height&quot; field which is confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Window tool also has a third field called &quot;Elevation&quot; which is used to determine its Z height. (It has this PLUS both Height fields.)<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it would make more sense for the first &quot;Height&quot; field to be named something like &quot;Z Offset.&quot; Not only does this differentiate the field from the other Height field, it also better describes how this field might be used _in conjunction with_ the Elevation field.<br/>
<br/>
This would affect Doors in Walls, Windows in Walls, Symbols in Walls, and potentially other PIOs that insert into walls.<br/>

<br/>
If the hatch is set to rotate with the element, corner junctions look odd (not how you would typically draw them in a technical drawing) as the hatch is not continuous (see img Hatch Rotating in Wall). If the hatch is set not to rotate with the element, it displays continuous but in certain rotations that are either parallel or perpendicular to the hatch, it is completely incorrect as that hatch might represent another thing altogether (see img Hatch not Rotating in Wall).<br/>
<br/>
I think we need another option, a hybrid between the two which will display a non-rotated hatch where it should be continuous, and rotate it where the hatch angle matches the element rotation. Perhaps we can establish a connection between hatch repeat angle and the angle the element is at to determine when this swap should occur.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at the brainstorming video we recorded as we explored the options available.<br/>

As handy as this feature is, it creates a barrier to effective use because the principle of how WGFs work is so elusive. I am not even referring to the cascade of importance from user folder to WGF to application folder. I am talking about the *manual* process involved in saving something in the right place. When I create a new section line style or a new title block style, I want to be asked if perhaps I would like to save this object to the workgroup folder. (In case I don&#39;t have this folder, I would like to be asked if I want to save it to my user folder but I don&#39;t want to digress). <br/>
However, this newly created object will just sit in my current document and die with it in case I delete it. It will not be made available to me in other documents, nor will it be placed in the WGF for my coworkers to use.<br/>
This whole dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that WGFs *don&#39;t get migrated*. So, as soon as users update their Vectorworks, the WGF gets left behind and needs manual migration.

It has been requested by some clients that we add &quot;first side, second set&quot; options for the 3D chamfer tool, as well as a way to determine the first and second side via clicks. This would be a great addition to our freeform modelling tools and would (based on user feedback) bring us on par with other applications that have this ability.<br/>

I think it would a good idea to list somewhere on the intranet all the required installs in order to run an autobuild of Vectorworks.  Preferably this method would simply pull from perforce and list them so only one data point needs to be kept up to date.

If clients send ma DWG and I drag it into my Vectorworks file for importing, I get the same Archicad icon. <br/>
I wish we could be a little more selfish about this kind of thing also (and I think it is a nice feature to be able to double-click a foreign file and VWX imports it into a new, blank document).

<br/>
This would work is the same way ae the &quot;Domino&quot; bounding-box selector works in that when you enable the radio button next to Top Trim, that would be fixed so that when the height value of a soft goods object is changed, the Top Trim remains fixed and the Height and bottom trim alter (and vice versa).<br/>
<br/>
This would save a lot of trial and error when working out the height of borders especially when you need to specify custom heights for softgoods items.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Every so often I encounter the following pop-up when trying to delete a class, and have never really understood the context of why it sometimes appears and sometimes doesn&#39;t:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unable to delete the objects. One or more of the objects that you are trying to delete is a required component or automatically generated component of a plug-in object and cannot be deleted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The message seems to suggest that the class is being used by a Plug-in Object, but I know this isn&#39;t the case because typically it&#39;s a class I&#39;ve made myself and it hasn&#39;t been used in any special way.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today I finally realized the circumstances that cause this pop-up: objects in that class are being *cut through in a Section Viewport*.<br/>
<br/>
(Regarding the text of the pop-up... perhaps a Section Viewport is technically considered a PIO? But I wouldn&#39;t have assumed so).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As it stands, I doubt a typical user understands what this pop-up means or what to do about it. It should be solved in one of two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Make it so that you +can+ delete these classes, and it would brute force delete the objects even if they&#39;re being cut through in the Section Viewport.<br/>
<br/>
-or-<br/>
<br/>
2.  Alter the pop-up to better describe why the class can&#39;t be deleted, such as specifically saying it&#39;s because of a Section Viewport.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note that this only applies when choosing the option to &quot;Delete all of the objects&quot;, not when choosing to reassign objects to a different class which is always possible but not the goal.

<br/>
This can currently be done with the Data Tag and the option to link values to fields. But with this workflow the user needs to apply a Data Tag and this Data Tag needs to display the desired value. Also the linking works only one way: From the Data Tag to the PIO and not back (bidirectional).<br/>
<br/>
Another workflow could be to set up a formula in the Data Manger. But we think, this is only a workflow for advanced users.<br/>
<br/>
A simple suggested solution is, to make the dropdown of the Data Source also available for PIOs. It would be great if you could look at this.<br/>
<br/>
More details in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Workflow examples:<br/>
 * Syncing values of custom record formats into fields of PIO<br/>
 * Writing Object Functions into the PIO like &quot;Story&quot;<br/>

While multiple view is enabled, double clicking on the zoom to selection will zoom all views to that selection.  If multiple view is not enabled, then do nothing on the second click.

<br/>
In the real world these gaps are often visible (most often in brickwork walls) but filled with material (sealant, foam tap, expanding foam, etc). <br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;d like to be able to control the attributes of this gap so that we can:<br/>
 # Make it opaque, so that you can&#39;t see through it in model views, especially elevations.<br/>
 # Make it an object that we can dimension to when placing a window style in isolation of a wall, as we typically do when we draw elevations of windows for window schedules. Because we typically dimension to the structural opening of windows.<br/>
<br/>
Currently we use the Trim feature to workaround this by creating an architrave that&#39;s depth = 0.5 mm and width = jamb + shim gap.

<br/>
We should think about the lifetime of messages.<br/>
<br/>
+*Current situation*+<br/>
<br/>
Currently we only have 2 categories: messages and progress bars.<br/>
<br/>
*Messages* are dismissed on the next interaction within the application window or when a new message is pushed.<br/>
<br/>
*Progress bars* are dismissed as soon as the operation time is beeing completed.<br/>
<br/>
+*Suggestion*+<br/>
<br/>
We where thinking about 3 categories: Messages, alerts and progress bars<br/>
<br/>
*Messages* (like &quot;Backup completed&quot; - In VW2021 with a green background) are nice to now, but not very important. They could disappear after a few seconds if the curser is moving over the application window. But this kind of messages could stay if the curser isn&#39;t moving at all or if Vectorworks is covered behind other applications. This means, if the user will switch back to Vectorworks, the message is still there for a certain amount of time.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if the user could define how many seconds the messages are displayed. This setting could be implemented under the gear icon of the Utility Bar.<br/>
<br/>
*Alerts* (like &quot;Backup failed&quot; - In VW2021 with a red background) are important. The alerts should stay longer. We could also think about keeping them until the user dismisses them manually by clicking on them. Or they could have a little x in the upper left corner (compare macOS Big Sur).<br/>
<br/>
Also here, the prefered settings could be made accessible for the user by clicking on the gear icon of the Utility Bar.<br/>
<br/>
*Progress bars* are dismissed a soon as the operation time is beeing completed (same behaviour as planned for VW2022.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please let us know, if you are starting to work on a new task for a future version regarding the lifetime of messages. We would be happy to assist in the discussion.

When that object is rendered, the solid fill color will be used to fill the object. The hatch, gradient, ... fill will only be used for that object if it is embedded in an autohybrid object and the 2D/Plan view is active.<br/>
<br/>
The same workflow can be used for hybrid objects. In this case the hatch, gradient, ... fill will be used for the 2D part of the object while the 3D part will still use the solid fill color.<br/>
<br/>
Often users can&#39;t find the way how to change the 3D fill color once a hatch, gradient, ... fill has been applied to the object.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that it is very cumbersome to change the 3D fill color since that color is not visible in the attributes palette anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If the user wants to change the 3D fill color, he needs to remove the hatch, gradient, ... fill and move back to the solid fill color. Then the fill color can be changed. But after that action, the user needs to choose the hatch, gradient, ... fill all over again. The previous settings aren&#39;t remembered.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to still show the fill color in the attributes palette (and in the class options dialog, the materials dialog, ...) when a hatch, gradient, ... fill has been selected? When the object is a simple 2D object it could be hidden or greyed, but for 3D or hybrid objects it should be reachable and modifiable.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re sure this would make Vectorworks more intuitive.

<br/>
While we can see the first six and last six digits of a serial number in the About Vectorworks window, it does not take a lot of effort to find the full license elsewhere, such as the Registry on Windows or plist files on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks has been installed by an admin user, then the installer log is usually locked to standard users.<br/>
<br/>
However, when someone runs the updater, the license is there for all to see, so even if someone does not know about the registry or plist files, Vectorworks gives them a hand and displays it when they update.<br/>
<br/>
Suggest the updater shows &#39;XXXXXX&#39; etc as per the About... window and the license is installed at System level, not User level.

<br/>
We can align the text, but not control the amount of space to the edge. Often you end up with creating an extra box with white fill around for it not to look so cramped.

<br/>
Updated speaker tool is very cool! This tool will help you a lot with realistic audio array plans. <br/>
<br/>
Sadly, there are some subjects that I want to point out. For example, the auto hybrid function, what works very well (on paper), is enormously slow. When using real symbols (even the ones from VWX), populate array is very hard.<br/>
<br/>
Even dragging of total arrays to X - Y - Z coordinates is a pain in the ** because it automatically updates the array. Workaround for this is to not populate, move the bumper to the correct position, and populate later on.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to note / ask are the following points:<br/>
<br/>
- Will there be an option to fix this, and enhance the workflow in terms of the auto generating 2D part (I think this makes the tool very slowly).<br/>
- Bumpers can only be added as one bumper (A). In the future you should want to work with multiple bumpers (main bumper, underhang, etc.). Same as Speaker A, B and C.<br/>
- Braceworks rigging to a bumper works not how you want it. Speaker arrays could not be calculated within the Braceworks method, and attaching hoist to it is quite difficult. Will this be fixed?<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you have something on my feedback on this enhancement report. If you want that I split the subjects into multiple enhancements, will hear. <br/>

 <br/>
The issue is, when cutting a section VP that includes 3D spaces, the spaces in front obscure the ones behind. The user cares about the Spaces cut by the section, but not the ones beyond, even if they are technically “visible” from that viewpoint. They are visible, but obscured (and therefore irrelevant to the SVP). The workaround of setting the depth of plane to a shallow one when there are 3D spaces in the view can be done by the user, but it also changes the look of the section. The user would like to have a full-depth section, but be able to tag only Space objects touching the plane.<br/>

When the Resource Manager is set to filter a specific type of Resource, but none exist in the current view, there is a message which simply reads &quot;There are no items to show in this view.&quot; This isn&#39;t particularly helpful, so there should be a button which says &quot;Switch to viewing all resource types&quot; that you can click to switch the filter to All Resources. This would be the same as choosing it in the filter dropdown, but would help avoid a common scenario where users unfamiliar with that dropdown are left stranded, especially when using the Search function or clicking through Libraries.

One of the biggest changes that has been made at the GDTF share side is the ability to easily download the entire library in one go. (currently over 430 files)<br/>
This presents a two problems for Spotlight,<br/>
 * When importing multiple GDTFs  there is no way to control where the GDTFs land in the files&#39; resource folder hierarchy.<br/>
 * When importing GDTFs the warning dialogue telling the user that a GDTF with the same name already exists lacks several key features<br/>
 ** the name of the file that will be overwritten is not displayed, so you cannot tell whether you want to overwrite it or not<br/>
 ** no option to repeat your chosen action for all the GDTFs being imported<br/>

<br/>
For example: see https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-176387<br/>
<br/>
The customer wants:<br/>
<br/>
The Vectorworks object name to map to Name (which is fine)<br/>
<br/>
The ifcFurnishingElementType name to map to Type (which we figured out with help from the engineer and UK Digital Practice) Have to say it went over my head a bit, which doesn&#39;t bode well for customers.<br/>
<br/>
The TypeName shown in the viewer to be blank (currently also has the same as above) no obvious way to change this<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
While working on this case they also were originally using the field ElementType which doesn&#39;t appear to go anywhere in the IFC viewer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Basically the fields in Vectorworks and the fields in the viewers do not seem to have the same names or any obvious relationship. Is there or could there be some kind of mapping diagram Vectorworks could pull up for any given IFC?

This hits every school or university and every customer working for or with the government. Additionally, the bigger a customer is, the more likely they adapt to that guideline to keep their network and clients safe.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore they are not able to use download functionalities for the Library and miss all additional content.<br/>
<br/>
The solution would be to place the Library Folder in ProgramData (just as example) or make it possible to redirect the folder to a chosen location.<br/>
<br/>
Till now customers try to work around that problem by using workgroup folders, distribute the needed files by their software distribution or accept it as &quot;not possible to use these&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When using workgroup folders, they face other disadvantages:<br/>
 # Someone needs to be able to get around their restrictions to get the content<br/>
 # They need to organize an additionally structure to use the content<br/>
 # IT-Department needs to be involved for (1) and maybe (2)<br/>
 # It&#39;s slow - imagine what is needed to get just one thing you need out of premium libraries<br/>
<br/>
Distributing files (by IT-Department):<br/>
 # very slow - tell their IT what to get and how to get it and where to put it<br/>
 # time consuming and therefore not likely to be used more than once a year<br/>
<br/>
Accepting as not possible:<br/>
 # missing a lot of content<br/>
 # switch to another program where you can get additional content without the big hassle<br/>
<br/>
Using the user folder instead:<br/>
 # there is still the problem of getting the content in the first place(see above)<br/>
 # distributing makes it slow and not flexible<br/>
<br/>
The best solution would be not to try work around it with other inconveniences or difficulties but fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Even more customers have at least permission issues (administrator installs vwx for the user). This would also be much better than before - at least the user would be able get the libraries alone. Even without following the guideline the user needs to get their IT to let them download/update the library.<br/>

at the moment coincident objects can be selected by short key J and click on the objects. Unfortunately you only see the object type like e.g. five times polygon. This isn&#39;t helpful for the customer and it&#39;s not very intuitive.<br/>

 # Worksheets: Formatting UI to be more intuitive and in-line with industry standards Excel: Delete a row or column should not break formulas. Deleting a row or column in a worksheet should not break other worksheets that reference cells in it.  Double clicking on a formula should highlight the cells that are referenced in the formula and color code them like Excel.

 # Text editing: Text within PIO or symbols should be “editable from the OIP.  This would give better control of the graphic output. Any Object that has a text component (dimensions, receptacles, parking spaces, etc.) should have the Font and Size pop up menus in the OIP.<br/>

At present this is unfortunately limiting how the user can visualize there fence design.) See the example below:<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-01-31-13-00-04-862.png!<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the Frame/Panel settings have a 4&quot; high frame. (See attached example Vectorworks file.)<br/>
<br/>
This may be bug-like, but this enhancement request could help solve it and allow for more design options...<br/>
<br/>
To remedy this *_and_* to allow for more flexibility for the frame design, it would be ideal to provide the user with separate frame bar width &amp; height settings for the top, bottom, and left/right. That way, the Top frame bar could have a width of 2.1&quot;, for example, and the coincident faces would not be seen.<br/>
<br/>
In conjunction with this, it would be best to correct how the top, bottom and left/right frame bars &quot;interacted&quot; with each other so that when sizes changed, no overlapping faces are created. (If it helps for reference the relationship of the Top Rail vs Post already works this way – As the height of the top rail changes, the top face of the post increases/decreases accordingly.)<br/>

Thank you!

                                            <td class="description">      Having now had a chance to work with the railing/fence tool a bit more, I am liking it more and more but it has become clear that its &quot;symbols&quot; behave a bit too differently from other similar tools. That is to say, while the railing/fence tool does work and can have saved parameters in symbols, the tool and its symbols break from the &quot;object style&quot; PIO paradigm enough that it is causing users (and to be honest, me a bit too) some confusion. The confusion is occurring because so many of our tools now use objects styles but the R/F tool does not. It would be great to have the R/F tool conform to the other standards object style-capable tools. <br/>
<br/>
Some examples of the inconsistencies I have noted so far that would be best folded into the established object style methodology:<br/>
<br/>
- After editing the settings for the R/F tool, the user is able to &quot;save symbol&quot;. This creates a red Symbol/PIO in the Resource Manager, however this differs from other similar tools (wall, door, window, etc) that allow the user to save a &quot;style&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
!image-2021-01-30-18-09-45-174.png!<br/>
<br/>
- The R/F tool&#39;s red symbol/PIO that appears in the Resource Manager cannot have its configuration edited by right-clicking on it and choosing &quot;Edit&quot;. Instead, (unless I am mistaken) the user must load the &quot;symbol selection&quot; in the R/F tool&#39;s mode bar, then that symbol&#39;s configuration can be edited. It appears that the user is unable to then save over the existing symbol (for example if the R/F symbol simply needed a minor adjustment) and must instead save a new symbol with a slightly different name. (If I am missing how to simply edit an existing R/F symbol, please let me know.) In contrast, to edit a wall style, a door style, etc, a user may simply right-click on the red symbol/PIO in the RM for that object style and choose edit. Changes would be saved right back into that exact red symbol/PIO.<br/>
<br/>
As I work with the R/F tool I will add more examples of how the object style methodology could be incorporated.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering these enhancements. Having the R/F tool behave like of object style-capable tools would help build adoption of it and show that we are maintaining a consistency within the application.<br/>

In order to resize the column to accommodate the text on one line in a cell, the user must either click&amp;drag the column wider or go to Format &gt; Column width command and adjust it. (Using &quot;wrap text&quot; would allow the long text to fit within the existing column, but it increases the row height which  is not desirable in some cases.)<br/>
<br/>
To make this process much smoother and to maintain the established row height, it would be great to have an option available to automatically (or at least very easily) resize the column width to fit the entered text. There are two possible ways to implement that I am thinking of at the moment but this is open for UX consideration. The second may be best, but I&#39;ll describe both:<br/>
 # When the user ctrl-clicks a column header, the menu would have an option to &quot;match column width to content&quot;. This option could be checked on/off. As cell contents increases or decrease, the column width would increased or decreased respectively. <br/>
 # When the user ctrl-clicks a column header, the menu would have a command to &quot;fit column width to content&quot;. When that command is selected, that column will resize to fit to the widest content in any of that columns cells. If the user changes the content, the command would need to invoked again manually. If this way of invoking the command is best, then it should also be activated by double-clicking on the divider between the header cells, which is possible with MS Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this enhancement. I believe it would increase user satisfaction with using worksheets.<br/>

 # Open the syms tree and find the record<br/>
<br/>
Instead it would be better if the List View window remembers the last position. (or having a nonmodal dialog )<br/>
<br/>
So when the list with the record selected (see screenshot) is closed and opened again it is on the same position.<br/>
<br/>
This could be optional enabled by an checkbox in case some developers prefer that the state is not remembered.<br/>

This means that when rows are added or removed, as they often are when scheduled items are added or removed, the user must reposition the worksheet manually if they wanted it to be &quot;anchored&quot; to any location other than the upper left corner.<br/>
<br/>
As requested by a user, it would ideal to have an &quot;anchor point&quot; for worksheets so that the point from which they expanded could be set by the user. (The default anchor point could remain as the upper left to match existing behaviour.) That way, if a worksheet was located at the bottom of a sheet (as seen in the attached screenshot mock-up) the worksheet could expand up when rows are added/expanded (or to the left if column were added/expanded.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached mock-up screenshot I have added anchor point options to the worksheet&#39;s OIP. The user would set the anchor point in the OIP after placing it on a design layer or sheet layer.

In several cases I&#39;ve been asked what is the point of the dialogue<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 fundamental problems with the it<br/>
<br/>
The first is that the workflow to edit a cable part is very inefficient, the user can only edit a single cable part at a time and has to open a separate dialogue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
The second is that all the edits/changes are only for the active file, meaning the user has no way to reuse them another project.<br/>
<br/>
These two issues when combined mean that there is very little incentive for the user to use the Manage Cable Parts dialogue to actually mange the parts, except for using the update button to import cable part library updates. It is far more efficient and in for them edit the cable part library itself.  Since any changes there will be usable in more than a single file<br/>
<br/>
To address this we need to make the part editing work flow faster and more efficient. <br/>
<br/>
Two things that would help are adding direct list editing to the Manage cable parts dialogue (not sure if its possible) and giving the user the ability to group edit parts (diameter, cross section area, start&amp;end connector and the cable set fields)<br/>
<br/>
Adding a method to save changes for future projects would also be very useful<br/>

<br/>
It would be good if we had the capability to resize/ rescale a default symbol i.e sofa. <br/>
<br/>
The workflow would be to place a vectorworks default content in at a specific dimension, then source a actually product that size or get something custom build to your design. <br/>
<br/>
The issue is that currently it takes a lot of guesses to get the asymmetric rescale factor to the correct dimension. With the scale object tool you can resize geometry by a specific distance but not asymmetrically. <br/>
<br/>
One of our other specialist mentioned that Autocad has a &#39;Stretch command which effectively does that to a selection in drawing.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
which would be very useful. <br/>

 # Cable diameter,<br/>
<br/>
 ## rename to exterior diameter, currently its not clear anywhere in Spotlight or the help whether this refers to the cables exterior diameter (not commonly used or referenced to in the real world electrical or cable planning) or the wire/conductor diameter (which is used more commonly in electrical and cable planning)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 ## it should not be used to calculate the cross section area of a cables wire/conductor unless the configuration of the cable is accounted for, (number of wire/conductors)<br/>
 ## add a new wire/conductor diameter field linked to the Cross section area and AWG fields, preferably have this as a auto generated field based on them<br/>
 # Cross section area,<br/>
<br/>
 ## this should be directly in the data record, not generated based on the exterior diameter of the cable part, must use mm²<br/>
 ## Add a wire gauge field to support US users,should be directly entered into the record<br/>
 ## If possible these should either be linked so that changing one will show the nearest appropriate value in the other <br/>
I have attached a standard conversion chart <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 # Cable configuration field should be added<br/>
<br/>
 ## we need to be able to document US cable standards like 14/12 labeling standard. Users in other countries also need to know the number of wires/conductors in the cable,<br/>
<br/>
Making these changes would better support the way our users work in the real world,<br/>
<br/>
In both the US and Europe the normal way to spec a cable is to refer to the AWG (US) or cross section area <br/>
<br/>
for example in US terminology a 14/12 socapex cable would be specified, where 14 refers to the number wires (cable configuration) and 12 refers to the AWG of the cable<br/>
<br/>
Common European terminology  the user would specify a 2.5mm² Socapex (for 16a per circuit) or a 1.5mm² socapex (for 10a per circuit)<br/>

I found a lot of inconsistencies, a great part related to the stories structure.<br/>
It is very easy to create a structure of the story and the duplicate them when all is needed is a simple model, i.e. internal and extenal walls, windows, doors.<br/>
As soos as the model need to be more detailed, the problems arise.<br/>
1) The pillar object<br/>
 the pillar is recognized by the walls as similar object, and then a wall can joint to.<br/>
 Indeed, the pillar is not recognized as valid wall by the &quot;Space&quot; object, which find a hole in the perimeter;<br/>
 The pillar, when exported as IFC, is misplaced somewhere along the Z axis (bug already submitted) and it is not recognised as element able to close spaces;<br/>
2) so I switched to Structural Element, used as Beam or Column.<br/>
 This object has only a starting level given from space, either for the starting point and for ending point.<br/>
It is not possible to indicate, as for walls, a starting and ending level;<br/>
3) ditto for slab.<br/>
<br/>
If I need to change the hight of a beam, now I have to go to the beam and change the dimension; I wish to go to the relevant levels (i.e. Beam Base and Beam Top, or Beam Base and top slab, or whatever I&#39;ll use) and change as for walls.<br/>
<br/>
Now the only way I found is to use walls...<br/>
<br/>
4) The extrude are not considered in the Stories bound...<br/>
<br/>
Final wish: Please, made all 3D object relevant to building aware of stories bound!

Currently, Schematic Views show a very similar out-of-date border to those of Viewports. However, the function cannot be hidden in the same way.

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t include only the texts that are in the drawing. It also includes: Text withing groups and symbols, Text in symbols that aren&#39;t in the drawing but in the Resource Manager, Text in settings of PIOs and Tools.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that the user can select all text in the drawing with the Select Similar Tool, but this only selects the text in the drawing. Not the Text in groups, symbols and so on.<br/>
<br/>
It gets more complicated if the font that the user wants to exchange isn&#39;t installed on the computer. In this case the Font Mapping will exchange the missing font with an installed one. But the user can&#39;t detect which are the old text objects, that have to be switched to the new font.<br/>
<br/>
In a workaround the user could now set the Font Mapping of the old font with kind of a placeholder font. In a second step, the user could take the Select Similar Tool and exchange the placeholder font with the new font (As you can see here gets cumbersome and complicated). And again, the Select Similar Tool only selects the text in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks should have a central place, where the user could manage the fonts in the drawing.

<br/>
In some cases long hook clamps can offset a fixture by up to 250mm from the truss or lighting pipe, however, when the lighting devices export their height does not take this into account.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions just ask.<br/>

<br/>
Would be great if on export there was a command for complex mesh geometry to reduce the geometry count (much like simplify mesh, perhaps even with a preview).<br/>
<br/>
Also, It would be great if there was a way to automatically swap circular truss chords for a square profile to reduce geometry count.<br/>
<br/>
This would help prospects and new users with complex files and a lack of experience.<br/>
<br/>
This is primarily for prospects and inexperienced users creating an un-efficient and over the complex project and just expecting it to work perfectly. They first criticise the software and never acknowledge their lack of experience in causing the slowness in Vision.<br/>
 <br/>
The workflow where the slowness occurs when they import an overcomplex mesh object from the set designer and then...<br/>
 # throw tons of lights and truss and kit.<br/>
 # complain when it is slow to respond.<br/>
Export ESC obviously is a suitable answer but I worry it just doesn’t look as good texture-wise.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could select all of the objects on a scenic layer and run the simplify mesh command en-masse and have it reset the objects after the export.<br/>

A way around this request for us was to add a bitmap to the &#39;top view&#39; of a symbol but on a seperate class to the actual models top view. So in the spreadsheet with the right class on we had the &#39;actual image instead of the rendered image.  <br/>

<br/>
However, when editing the 3D Wall Hole component, the &quot;Show Other&quot; dropdown is greyed out and inaccessible. I frequently want to see and reference the 3D component to make sure the Wall Hole is aligned and sized properly.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, there&#39;s sort of a workaround, because if you enable &quot;Show Other Objects While in Edit Modes&quot; you do see the 3D part of the symbol instance as it happens to exist on the Design Layer, but there are three problems with this workaround. First, you see everything else in the model, which might cause problems with all the excess geometry. Second, this isn&#39;t what a user would expect given the existence of the Component Edit bar in the first place. Third, it&#39;s inconsistent behavior compared to how &quot;Show Other Objects While in Edit Modes&quot; usually works (i.e. not related to the currently edited object).<br/>
<br/>
Solution:<br/>
<br/>
The Component Edit &quot;Show Other&quot; dropdown should be made usable when editing a 3D Wall Hole; it would control whether a user sees the 3D Component of the current symbol. Accordingly, the &quot;Show Other Objects While in Edit Modes&quot; would only control the display of everything outside the symbol.
