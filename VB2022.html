{noformat}<br/>
def TempToolCallback(a,b,c): <br/>
    x, y =     vs.vstGetCurrPt2D() <br/>
    vs.Message(str([a,b,c,x,y])<br/>
<br/>
 vs.RunTempTool( False, TempToolCallback ){noformat}<br/>
This python Script runs in a Vectorscript but not in a Marionette Script. Finally the request would be, that the possibility of user-interaction of pascal scripts would work in the same comfortable way (or work at all) in a python script and/or Marionette Script.<br/>
<br/>
I think this requirement exists till the python implementation and is devoutly wished from all scripters. I detect some improvements in SP3 (CallTool can handle a callback now) thats why again hope is flaring and looked again in the possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
At one End it would be great for Marionette if a Node-Script (Button) would allow to interact with Vectorworks (pick an object, draw something etc.) which would make many things much more user-friendly. Seems to be hard to implementate.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is a limitation but it would be nice to not seeing a crash.

<br/>
To reproduce <br/>
open a new file<br/>
<br/>
select several truss libraries in the resource manger and download them<br/>
<br/>
insert a single section of truss into the design layer file,<br/>
<br/>
Activate the replace truss command in the Spotlight rigging menu<br/>
<br/>
In the Replace truss dialogue hit the truss inventory button to enter the truss inventory dialogue<br/>
<br/>
Hit the update button to add the downloaded truss libraries into the inventory<br/>
<br/>
once the list of trusses in the inventory has updated hit the export button to export a CSV file of the inventory to desktop<br/>
<br/>
open the CSV file with Excel<br/>
<br/>
In excel change the contents of the USE column to true for all rows (except the header) and change the count column to 10 for all rows again except fot eh header.<br/>
<br/>
save the file<br/>
<br/>
in Spotlight use the import button in the truss inventory to import the edited CSV file back into the inventory,<br/>
Spotlight will crash to desktop<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell if the you only make a few changes to the CSV file in excel the file will successfully import, but the moment the number of changes goes above a certain number Spotlight will crash to desktop<br/>

Exchanging a distributor for another distributor removes all power planning patch information. In the attached drawing, I have one generator and TWO distributors. Replacing one distro via the Select SYmbol button in the OIP removes all patch info from both distro systems.<br/>
All the cables retained their start and end points, but none of the devices retained their patch mapping information.<br/>
To test, please open the attached file.<br/>
 # View the patch information in the power planning palette.<br/>
 # Select one of the Distros.<br/>
 # Click on the select symbol button in the OIP.<br/>
 # Select a new distro.<br/>
<br/>
After the replacement is complete, the power planning palette loses the patch information. Refreshing the palette doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
To confirm, select a distributor or lighting device and check to see if they are connected to anything in the patch selection dropdowns.<br/>
Also, select the cable and note that the start and end points still exist.<br/>

attached a file and a very long video (dont be afraid of it, it has loading times you can skip). Video as a zip, because it would have a size of 300mb.<br/>
<br/>
If replacing truss from H30D to H30V it crashes when the truss system is a position.<br/>
If I ungroup this into normal truss objects, the corner are not connect after replacing.<br/>

Please take a look into this.<br/>

Block Screen tiedoston vasemmassa laidassa olevat Dropit M3, M4, M40 ja M41 on ne joilla olen testannut asiaa. M3 ja M4 on Hoist Up niin ne generoivat virheen ja väärän laskelman. M40 ja M41 on Hoist Down niin niistä ei tule virheitä ja laskenta onnistuu. Samoin käy M3 ja M4 kun ne kääntää Hoist Down.<br/>
<br/>
Drop Up Down tiedostossa ei ole vastaavaa ongelmaa vaikka käytössä on samoja objekteja ja Hoistit on Up.<br/>

<br/>
When planning DMX cables, it can happen that you have to run through a cable path twice.<br/>
<br/>
This leads in the current beta 2023 to the fact that this crashes or the cable is not displayed correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a file and a video.<br/>

Greetings<br/>

                VW Crashes When Creating Section Viewport from Existing Top/Plan Viewport (Mac Only) - Multi thread - VGM::TessellationMgr::TessellateGeometry

<br/>
Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Top/Plan Viewport that displays a Wall and some Windows.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the Top/Plan viewport&#39;s design layer<br/>
-Convert the Window to a style as shown<br/>
-Edit the 2D Components of the new style<br/>
-Go to a Front view and run the &quot;Generate 2D from 3D&quot; command, then Ungroup<br/>
-Create Polygons using the Inner Boundary Mode as shown<br/>
-Delete the Lines (I did this by drawing a new Line and using the Select Similar tool)<br/>
-Exit back to the sheet layer<br/>
-Update the Graphic Legend<br/>
-Select the Top/Plan viewport and run the &quot;Create Section Viewport&quot; command<br/>
-Draw the section line as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that VW crashes. Crash log is attached (I couldn&#39;t get it to symbolize for some reason).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the crash on Windows 10 so it looks like Mac-only.

    Hello!<br/>
<br/>
We are working on a Landscape project and we are having issues with ifc export in VW2022. <br/>
<br/>
We have checked that our model has right coordinates. We have also a reference cube, that all different engineers have in same place. We have all other engireering and arcitectural projects dwg files referenced to our model and they all went to the right location automatically. But when we export our model, it jumps off to a different location. We have reset out internal origin to be in the same place as architectural model and checked the location coordinates again, but the exported ifc still jumps off to a wrong location. <br/>
<br/>
Have been working with the same project in previous version of Vectorworks. When we set the internal origin according to architectural model, it worked fine before.<br/>
<br/>
I did not find help on the forum. Do you have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks file, exported BIM and computer information is all available on link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z4xyqapkwb5gmxj/AAAeSsPlOuy2Nu8GxafxWd8za?dl=0<br/>

<br/>
After conferring with other Vectorworks industry specialists, I updated my application 2023 SP2. I set the import options to what I though would produce the least amount of issues. Once the import began, it is quickly discovered that there are almost 11300 elements trying to import. Once the loader reached about 4900 elements, Vectorworks would crash and close, and would present me with the Apple crash report. <br/>

This file imports fine into v2022 SP3 (636848) but does take some time.<br/>
<br/>
Alas it appears to import into v2023 but when the dialogue comes up saying that the import succeeded you are unable to dismiss as the program crashes at that point. You get the spinning beachball.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The file has about 50,000 3D polys but they&#39;re not that complex. In v2022 I note that the geometry is 5345km away from the internal origin. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s why perhaps this problem exists?<br/>

I launched the updater from the Vectorworks folder and got the &quot;Update VW&quot; dialogue but when I clicked the Update&quot; button I get the same &quot;Please close...) message.  I am attaching a screen shot of the version number of the updater. Next I deleted VW 2023 Beta 6 and reinstalled it from the same .dmg that I had used to install it originally.  I got a message &quot;Updater needs to be refreshed&quot;(screen shot attached) which I did.  I launched the updater from the Applications folder (VW was not running) clicked &quot;Update&quot; and got the same &quot;Please close...&quot; message.  Since the updater had been &quot;refreshed&quot; I checked the version # of the updater and it was the same as the previously mentioned screen shot.

- Add plug-in to your workspace<br/>
<br/>
- Open attached file &quot;Testfile 9098_vwi_no_multiview.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Select tool. Click &quot;Don&#39;t show again&quot; for all debug alerts that pop up.<br/>
<br/>
- Click on &quot;Update&quot; button in mode bar (redlined in screenshot &quot;mode bar fenster.gpg&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
   This will trigger a regeneration of all window PIOs in the document.<br/>
<br/>
- Have a look at 2D components / Back view (see screenshot &quot;back view no multiview.png&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
  Note that there is a small gap between the outmost line of the green frame and the blue window sill.<br/>
<br/>
  These objects (green frame and blue sill) are created by the PIO and assigned to it by Set2DComponentGroup<br/>
<br/>
- Now open &quot;Testfile 9098_vwi_multiview.vwx&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  This is the identical document as the first one except that I had disabled multiview in the other document<br/>
<br/>
- Select tool and click on update button<br/>
<br/>
- Have a look at 2D components / Back view<br/>
<br/>
  Note that the back view looks different (back view in multiview.png). THe green frame looks slighly different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the difference is that Set2DComponent did not attach the new (correctly drawn) group to the PIO but left the old one (which was drawn at an incorrect position).<br/>
<br/>
Somehow Set2DComponent does the correct thing if multiview is disabled but fails if it is enabled.<br/>
<br/>
Debugging revealed that - if multiview is enabled - the bug seems to happen somewhere in CheckInputDataForComponentGroup whichj is called by Set2DComponentGroup.<br/>
<br/>
In these lines 3059ff in GraphicDataManager.cpp<br/>
<br/>
if (!UseMainContainerFor2DGraphic(inhObject, inoutComponent) &amp;&amp; !GraphicDataManager::DeleteWrongObjects(inhObjectToAdd, true, ELevelsOfDetail::All, ECollectDrawListOptions::Extract2DFromHybridGroups, nullptr))<br/>
					outResult = ESetSpecialGroupErrors::CannotSet_BadData;<br/>
<br/>
DeleteWrongObjects returns false and therefore Set2DComponent does not do anything and leaves the old swap group in place.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t quite understand what&#39;s going on in DeleteWrongObjects, but it seems that this function deletes all geometric subobjects of the group I want to become the back view and then DeleteWrongObjects sees that the group is basically empty and returns false.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, DeleteWrongObjects should not delete these objects (green and blue 2D polygons that represent frame and window sill) in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
It is also very weird that the bug does only happen if multiview is enabled. If there was actually something wrong with the obbjects in the passed group, they should have been deleted in the other document as well.<br/>
<br/>
This bug in Set2DComponent also seems to destroy the undo table (you will get strange undo warnings for instace when editing 2D components).<br/>

Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a complex Extrude Along Path.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Enter the EAP&#39;s Profile edit mode<br/>
<br/>
Note that this works without crashing, but if you exit you&#39;ll get an &quot;invalid object&quot; error.<br/>
<br/>
- Now close the file without saving, then reopen it<br/>
- Run the Scale Objects command and scale the entire drawing by 24x or so<br/>
- Now edit the EAP&#39;s profile again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now VW crashes. Crash log is attached.<br/>
<br/>
This EAP was created in VW 2023 SP3. If I export it to VW 2022 I see the same problem there.

<br/>
Several users still have issues with the OS System Monterey and Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
Our support team is working hard to figure out what is happening and help our customers. They delete the user folder create a second OS account. Nothing helps. <br/>
<br/>
All users are on the latest version of Monterey 12.2 and the latest Vectorworks version 2022 SP2.1.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached the user folder, a scree-shot of the OS, and a short clip that demonstrates the wrong behavior of the menu of Vectorworks.  In the beginning, we &quot;rename&quot; the user folder to be sure we launch a &quot;clean&quot; version of Vectorworks. It is impossible to use the menu after Vectorworks is launched. Nothing helps here. The context menu works fine. <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if someone on your side could take a look into this with a higher priority because all users are getting started frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Draw a selection marquee around the Viewports and the Polyline<br/>
- Hold down the Shift key and quickly click on each Viewport to de-select them<br/>
<br/>
Note that the spinning beach ball appears. Sometimes it only lasts for 30 seconds or so but it often takes over 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
In other cases, I got similar delays just when selecting or right-clicking on Viewports on the same sheet, though that doesn&#39;t happen as consistently.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem in SP1 so it looks like an SP2 regression.

 * The first time when I attempted this, I received an Out of memory dialog - see the attached screenshot.<br/>

This was reported to the cloud team by Design Express. Vectorworks on the Cloud also crashes while trying to publish this sheet layer.

I found this issue while investigating a cloud job which consistently crashes on the cloud. The locally observed behavior explains why the Cloud job crashes every time - the Cloud always works with a freshly downloaded copy of the file.

Both the file and the Dump files are attached to the bug. It would be ideal to check the cause of the crash so we can rule out the connection to the virtual machine is the cause of this. Let me know if the dump file is useful or if you need more info.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      One of our very long term customers with 10 seats of Architect on VSS have been experiencing VGM crashes on multiple machines running either Big Sur or Monterey on identical iMacs (see attached screen shot for computer specs) running Vw 2022 SP3 and SP4. This issue did not occur with Vw 2021.<br/>
<br/>
The following machine had been experiencing the most crashes so was updated to Monterey to see if that would make a difference following Gunther&#39;s comment (see below). It didn&#39;t :<br/>
<br/>
EHXZCZ-CZPKAR-ZNZXZP-G0KDFF (Monterey)<br/>
<br/>
They have had two crashes and a freeze already this morning. <br/>
<br/>
These machines have also experienced crashes, though not as regularly:<br/>
<br/>
EHXZCZ-VZLKL7-ZZZ7ZM-G12T3T (Big Sur)<br/>
EHXZCZ-2Z9KC1-ZRZSZZ-G0JT3K (Big Sur)<br/>
EHXZCZ-KZ0KJW-ZNZJZF-G05JKD (Big Sur)<br/>
<br/>
The crashes happen in multiple projects so are unrelated to a particular file. We have also obtained one of their files and could see nothing out of the ordinary that might contribute to this issue (see attached). All machines should have had error reporting set to verbose for at least a week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gunther had this to say when I asked him about it last week:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_I have found a few of their crash reports.  Looks like it&#39;s related to VGM, in Justin Hutchison&#39;s area, though he&#39;s on holiday at the moment.  Might be able to have Dave D. take a look?_<br/>
<br/>
_I made some observations while digging into crash logs.  Anyone experiencing this crash, is using macOS 10.14 or 11.x. I looked at 100 or so crash reports, there were none on macOS 12. Perhaps a driver/graphics issue in older OS versions? This seems to be a Vectorworks 2022 issue also. Nothing shows up in Vectorworks 2021 or prior._<br/>
<br/>
_Wonder if they would be willing to update one of the computers to macOS 12 to see if it helps with the crashes?_<br/>
<br/>
Please give this a high priority as this is a high profile firm in Sydney.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

                Wall closure issues around windows
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I have found some wall closure issues when windows are next to other windows. In the attached file please see saved views 03-07. (02 can be ignored in this JIRA ticket. 02 is for a future VE.) Unfortunately these will be show-stoppers for a customer trying to achieve the correct wall closures.<br/>
<br/>
03: The wall closure has not been excluded from the right side, but it is no appearing.<br/>
<br/>
04: I have had to exclude the wall closure from the left side because if I turn it on, a wall closure runs the full height of that window (even though the wall itself does not meet the upper portion of the window.<br/>
<br/>
05: Similar to 04<br/>
<br/>
06: Only a partial clause is shown<br/>
<br/>
07: Since the window configuration shown in 03-06 is on the &quot;unique&quot; side, this view shows a fairly common arrangement of windows with he same/similar closure issues.<br/>

Thanks for hitting this one!

 # Save file. Notice that memory is not released.<br/>
 # Now go into the Annotations layer of the viewports and try to manipulate objects. In particular try to enter Groups and move the objects within them. (sheet layers 21311 and 21312 currently have groups of polygons for brick coursing you could use).<br/>

Steps to reproduce:<br/>

Things I have done to solved the problem<br/>
<br/>
working with one screen<br/>
connecting one screen wit a HDMI in stead of HDMI to USB C<br/>
working with Vectorworks without any other program open<br/>
repair the Vectorworks<br/>
repair the user folder<br/>
re install the vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem didn&#39;t solved with this steps<br/>

                Spotlight: Power-Palette - Different behaviour when deleting objects
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
If you delete a device in the drawing, it updates the power palette immediately. <br/>
But if you delete a connection/cable, you need to refresh the web palette to see the changes. The behaviour should be equal to all objects shown in the web palette.<br/>
<br/>
Also: After deleting the device on the drawing and bringing it back with cmd+z it will not show up in the Power-Palette. <br/>
At this point you need to connect them again by drawing a cable between these devices. This will be really annoying if you need to draw a cable from understage to the Lighting Device at the Rigg again.

Indeed the point of origin on Vectorworks (see image) is placed close to Spain towards the Atlantic. whereas in other softwares (Global mapper, Argis, Qgis) the point is shifted towards the East.  <br/>
<br/>
This means that a client cannot import his tree surveys. The surveys are projected into the ocean. <br/>
<br/>
I am attaching the Qgis image with the location of the origin point (with WGS 84 coordinates) as well as the file (.tsv) and (shp) of the tree surveys. (Test arbres).<br/>

I also include an image of datum transformation. Maybe this will help<br/>

Issue 2: When doing the sum of the same two columns (cells of the database) in a separate cell (outside of the database cells) I get the result I expect. So good so far. If I now want to access this result from the third column of Issue 1, the strangest thing happens: not only do I get 0 in the third column, but the result in the separate cell also turns to 0, even though it is not connected in any way or shape with the third column (database cell).<br/>

The flip vertical command works in the top view.

This presents a problem in schematic view as shown in the attached screenshot.<br/>

The issues seen in the screenshot include:<br/>
 # In the schematic front view, the light appears to be hanging down from the top of the truss. It should be sitting on top.<br/>
 # In the side view, the light is also hanging down.<br/>
 # The draw beam for the light is checked.  In ISO view, the beam points to the focus point. In Schematic view, the beam points up and away.<br/>

<br/>
However, if you have a more complex site, you can&#39;t update more than one area at a time, otherwise, Vectorworks hangs and you have to force quit. <br/>
<br/>
The file attached is at the stage when you start having constant issues and it becomes impossible to work with it. The image shows three areas that my machine couldn&#39;t manage at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked on it in 656460, so it might be possible a solution has been achieved since.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it&#39;s a dream to be able to add Landscape areas and not worry about site modifier edges! Our users will love the new site model.

<br/>
Case - User wants to reference a file (e.g. building, attachments Obj_1, Obj_2, Obj_3) into another (e.g. terrain, attachment Main model).<br/>
It turns out that, if a wall has both end caps and inserted element (door, symbol) then VW creates huge selection area which breaks visibility - VW counts this as there are object far away. 3D geometry often fails to render properly.<br/>
<br/>
Attachment Main model consists of 3 referenced files:<br/>
Obj_1 - no end caps, but wall has inserted element - no problem<br/>
Obj_2 - end caps and inserted element - selected area is huge<br/>
Obj_3 - end caps but no element in a wall - no problem<br/>

                Shaded render: When moving objects when rendered they disappear

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
Originally this was going to be a question on the forum or probably Slack about whether or not when moving objects when in Shaded mode in v2022 it was correct that the object&#39;s bounding box became a black box when moved? Once placed they rendered ok.<br/>
<br/>
In v2021 in OpenGL moved objects when rendered remained rendered and you could see them properly.<br/>
<br/>
However it seems that if I do the same in v2023 the objects disappear when moved and do not reappear!<br/>
<br/>
The enclosed movie was made directly after the computer was restarted with just the programs opened. All renders are Medium quality and ambient occlusion on + Clip Cube. There are also the v2021,v2022 and v2023 files enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
The computer is a MBP M1 Max 32 core GPU + 64GB UM.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter <br/>
<br/>
PS The file came in as v2022. It was exported to v2021 and converted in v2023.  Just an observation I notice that v2022 and v2023 have bigger file sizes than v2021 although nothing has changed.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is a regression. The Reshape tool fails to move any plug-in objects that are both selected and included in the tool&#39;s marquee area. It works as expected in Vectorworks 2020, but does not work in Vectorworks 2022 or Vectorworks 2023. You can see the tool has been redesigned between 2020 and 2022 so perhaps that work affected this functionality. <br/>
<br/>
This functionality is crucial to this user&#39;s workflow. They draught 2D construction plans and rely on this functionality to move (2D) walls and all associated geometry including the 2D i-beam PIOs when the building design needs to be extended. Of greater concern is when walls or beams need to be moved small amounts, like an inch. It will not be apparent if such a change fails to complete as instructed by the user and there could be massive consequences for the construction and related costs.<br/>
<br/>
This is a highly replied upon function that is used frequently by the user and for which there is no easily applied substitute, hence why I&#39;ve marked this as &#39;Crucial.&#39; <br/>

See the attached screen recording demonstration and applicable .vwx file. <br/>

<br/>
If I use the structural member there is a difference between the 2d plan view and the 3d view<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
Draw a structural element en choose an IPE-300. The width is 150 and the height is 300. But when we look at the member in the 2d plan then we see a width of 300 instead of 150<br/>
If we go to the top plan view, then the width is correct, but the member becomes longer.<br/>

I think today I finally recognized what&#39;s causing this: for some reason it seems to be based on the current Zoom level that you&#39;re viewing the Sheet Layer. Clearly this should not be the case, as AO should only be dependent on the size of the actual Design Layer geometry plus the AO size determined in Lighting Settings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve captured the issue in the attached Screen Recording, in which I zoom out and hit Update to show that the AO is now smaller / more dense that it was previously. Then I update again after zooming backing in. Towards the end of the recording I duplicate the viewport and send to front / sent to back, to visually compare the two renders.<br/>

<br/>
we hat a customer complaining about the created Calculation reports of Braceworks.<br/>
The model from the export was scaled 10 times too small. In addition, various loads were attached to completely wrong Trusses (especially the hoists). This error occurred in Vectorworks v2021 and v2022. The structural analysis office uses the current RSTAB version.<br/>
<br/>
The export with file format SCIA was recognized as faulty by RSTAB.<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming questions from this customer:<br/>
<br/>
Why is there no possibility to control the export? <br/>
Why isn&#39;t the industry standard IFC supported? <br/>
Why the outdated DSTV? <br/>
Why is the export SCIA also broken?<br/>
<br/>
And also two points he mentioned, that are still not possible in 2022:<br/>
- Calculation of ground Support<br/>
- Pipes on raked trusses<br/>
<br/>
I sent this to [~mstaffel] by Mail, but want this in here, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping out here.<br/>

Best<br/>

Effectively if the design is saved and then Spotlight is restarted and the file reopened the power planning palette loses the majority of the connections between devices. the only fix that I have found so far is to re-cable all of the lights, power distributors and power supplies.<br/>

In the attached test file the system has been cabled and before saving the power planning palette displayed the connected power distributors and lights.<br/>

Reselect the generator and attempt to patch it again. <br/>

Select the same generator again and try to patch it to distro number two. This will work and resets the ability to patch.<br/>

What I expect to happen is Unpatching the generator and releasing the pull-down menu should reset to allow me to repatch to the same circuit.<br/>
Certainly, deselecting and reselecting the same generator should allow reusing the same circuit for patching.

Currently, at least seven cables are inserted. Each twofer seems to be utilizing two cables rather than the single cable needed.

<br/>
in the Power-Palette you can rearrange the components for a better overview. If you refresh the web palette, the rearrangement gets lost. Would be great if the arrangement stays the same.<br/>
<br/>
Right now you need to refresh the web palette to see changes of deleted cables.<br/>

                Spotlight Power Planning: Issue using Select Symbol in OIP for Distributor Object
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      While testing Distributor content, I found an issue when using the Select Symbol option in the Object Info Palette to change to a different distro.<br/>
<br/>
Using this workflow, rather than deleting the symbol, inserting, and reconnecting a new one, seems to causes the cable connection to &quot;break&quot;.  A new cable must be drawn to reestablish the connection to the Power Supply.  I wouldn&#39;t expect this to be Working as Designed.... but maybe it is?<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, a phantom distro is created in the Power Planning Palette even after deleting the distro and reconnecting a new one.  This issue can be resolved by saving the file and reopening.<br/>

attached is a customer file .<br/>
Originally project sharing but customer can reproduce it as a .vwx too.<br/>
Customer says, when opening file, suddenly textures / materials are not rendered any more.<br/>
In order to repair things, you have to force the object to update itself, e.g. you open components dialog of a wall and close it by clicking okay.<br/>
The problem occurs just by opening the file. No special steps of working.<br/>
I send the file to you because (hopefully) you can look deeper into this file than I can do.<br/>

Mesh furniture (downloaded from various source) end up becoming very big mesh objects in VW, cause file size to bloat - Making it very hard to operate. <br/>
<br/>
We have to put the furniture into a separate file with the main model referenced in, to not cause performance issue when working with the main file.<br/>
<br/>
See file with and without a few mesh objects in the Resources Browser.<br/>
<br/>
It is normal workflow to have a lot of objects in the Resources Browser as we go through furniture options. <br/>
<br/>
See enclosed file... with or without mesh furniture objects the file can go up to 3x in size. <br/>

This is correct. But if you want to change the pen color afterwards, the object doesn&#39;t adapt to the setting. All Enscape objects which are placed later on will have that initial pen color, even if the attributes palette is set differently in the mean time.<br/>
<br/>
The pen color of an Enscape object should be:<br/>
- (preferably) the color as indicated in the attributes palette, like with any other object type<br/>
- If it can handle just one color, it should always be black.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if a user had set an unlucky pen color (like yellow) in the attributes palette the first time he/she placed an enscape object, the user is bound to that pen color for the rest of the project for all the enscape objects.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Drag the file header to create a floating document window<br/>
- Make the floating window active<br/>
- Now click in the OIP or change the active tab in the Nav Palette<br/>
<br/>
Note that, as soon as you click, the focus changes to the application window and the active document disappears.<br/>
<br/>
Since the docked palettes are showing info from the active file, it seems like you should be able to keep that file active/visible while accessing the palettes. Some operations, like changing the visibility of classes/layers in the Nav palette, work fine without causing the focus to change.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the palette that&#39;s clicked-on is docked.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.<br/>

These issues were found while exporting Belgian Exterior Joinery objects to Ifc, but the issues seem to be linked to the IfcWindow tag. So, we presume that the same issues exist for US windows as well.<br/>

I&#39;ve investigated this further and noticed this only occurs whenever I manually change the path which means the first vertex of the path shifts away from the internal 0,0,0 origin.

<br/>
I&#39;m attaching the original user file (2 Dyke Road PROPOSED v2.vwx) and a simplified version of the file with the problematic walls (2 Dyke Road ISSUE SIMPLE.vwx).<br/>
<br/>
Open the &quot;2 Dyke Road ISSUE SIMPLE.vwx&quot; file and would see some walls (many are L-joined end-to-end).  Most of the walls have window inserts but have the following issues:<br/>
 # The wall geometry has large hollow areas inside<br/>
 # The wall holes do not cut through the wall.<br/>
 # Also notice the odd vertical plane midway between the two windows in each wall that has the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Resetting the walls corrects the issue and I have not been able to reproduce the issue after setting them.

<br/>
There&#39;s something wrong with the way renderworks is blending the two colors of the RW Background. Shaded is correct and matches how one would expect a gradient of those two colors should to be blended.<br/>

In the enclosed screenshot and Vectorworks file you can see two identical viewports. One is rendered in Custom Renderworks and you can see the water in the pool. The other is rendered using Redshift.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the water uses glass reflectivity.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Redshift doesn&#39;t render bump shaders. If that is a known limitation I won&#39;t file a VB but if not I will please let me know and I will.<br/>

And operate the same way several times.<br/>
(Or Press &quot;D&quot; key to add dimension and operate the same way several times.)<br/>
4) VW hangs up while the operation.<br/>
<br/>
The hang-up doesn&#39;t seem to freeze completely, but it looks every tool and command doesn&#39;t work even &quot;Quit&quot; , and there is no way other than doing force shutdown on the task manager.<br/>
<br/>
As long as we tried this seems to occur on Windows 10 only.<br/>
On Mac, the shortcuts don&#39;t seem to work.<br/>
<br/>

Because these changes are so random, I can&#39;t guarantee the customer a workflow he can be confident with.

Customer has to give out plans in format DXF/DWG with option &quot;Export Viewports as 2d graphics in Model Space&quot; aktive.<br/>

Use the attached files (&quot;COS East Portion.dwg&quot; and &quot;projection.txt&quot;).<br/>
 - Create a DWG referenced import - you will notice that some of the geometry is imported at the wrong location - thus, the viewport does not look ok.<br/>
 - Create a pure DWG import - it looks mostly ok. However, some of the objects are with line size = 0, or somehow invisible.

However current referencing code is not prepared to work in that way. We should decide how to proceed - either to not allow direct using and applying of the GIS settings, i.e. using the Use Document georeference settings option only allowed OR to add the appropriate code in the Subscriptions.cpp in a similar way to the one we use now when starting from the import menu command. <br/>
<br/>
I tend to follow the second approach because in VW2022 the reference with GIS settings is properly shown in regards to the geoimage and even stays on its place when updated, even in some cases seems that no GIS date are actually available... Now, probably due to T0 implementation, positioning and update does not work - probably this is the correct behavior, but for the end user it would appear as a regression.<br/>
<br/>
It might be however easier to allow only the Use the document&#39;s coordinate system...<br/>

There needs to be a way to stop interiorcad xg classes from being created automatically, especially when I&#39;m not in an interiorcad workspace. <br/>

In any standard Vectorworks Workspace. New document or opening an existing file. XG classes are created and I have to go in and manually delete them every time. <br/>

It creates issues for standardising my class structure. <br/>

<br/>
I encountered two possible crashes when running the Home Screen acceptance tests for build 677773. Both crashes were during a transition to the main application from the home screen. Details and logs are labeled Crash 1 and Crash 2.<br/>
<br/>
Crash 1:<br/>
<br/>
I was running the test for creating a new file, clicking New and selecting Ok in the dialog. As the home screen closed and the main application appeared, the software closed. There are three logs, including dmp file, for this crash attached.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Crash 2:<br/>
<br/>
In testing the operation of the Preferences button on the Message Center pane, I found the Preferences dialog was not appearing (previously logged in VB-190514). With the software in that state, I launched Zoom to record the screen for the bug. The attached video captures the following:<br/>
<br/>
-The Preferences button was clicked multiple times to get the dialog which did not appear.<br/>
<br/>
-The X of the Home Screen was clicked to exit the Home Screen.<br/>
<br/>
-An attempt was made to click the Help menu to get to the build number in the About dialog, but the software closed.<br/>
<br/>
One log file is attached for this (potential) crash.<br/>
<br/>
*It is possible that a second mouse click was registered that actually closed the application after closing the Home Screen for Crash 2 as its log appears to show a routine shutdown. One strange thing in the log file, however, is that the serial number was replaced by &quot;demo&quot; in the last section of logging.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Crash 3:<br/>
<br/>
Repeat of Crash 1 in build 689284. Attaching log files and .dmp file.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Crash 4: <br/>
<br/>
Repeat of Crash 1 in build 707692.

<br/>
However, there seems to be an issue were Line objects don&#39;t properly move to the Working Plane. Instead they get projected onto the Working Plane based on how they&#39;re currently drawn on the screen (this is a little hard to describe so take a look at the attached screen recording). It seems to not affect lines which happen to be perfectly perpendicular to the working plane; those move correctly. But all other lines behave incorrectly.<br/>

When selecting Top View and trying to Export to DWG, the process causes a long infinite spinning wheel or crashes VWX. <br/>

<br/>
The enclosed CONVENTION THEATRE DARLING HARBOUR.dwg has a lot of other files X reffed in. They are uploaded in this report.<br/>
<br/>
When trying to import, Vectorworks 2022 said it completed but I could never get back to the drawing (or even see it) as the spinning beach ball kept happening. It eventually worked in 2023 SP1 but there were the invisible viewports miles from the main drawing hence why it&#39;s included in this report .<br/>
<br/>
The Autocad online viewer seems to handle this ok although it took some time.<br/>
<br/>
This file is given out from the new Sydney International Convention Centre. [https://www.iccsydney.com.au/]<br/>
<br/>
We have been trying to get them to move over to Vectorworks. If this is a problem with their dwg output then I have a better case to sell. If however this is a Vectorworks import problem then I&#39;d like to know at least so I am fully informed. In particular those invisible viewports. It is a horrible file that everyone who uses this big venue has to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Peter<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS I also note that some files have multiple units. Does the import operation when dealing with the X refs adjust for each file as they come in?<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a serious matter with using data tags. The situation is as followed:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have multiple reference fils of differents halls, coming together in 1 main file. From the main file we are making DLVP&#39;s and worksheet overviews.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The specific drawing is for a exhibition event. The stands has records on it, where the data of the client is filled in. To show the data, we use data tags. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now the issue is, when a hall file is not updated in the main file, sometimes wrong info is shown at the data tag. When updating the specific hall reference file, the data tag will be ok again.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made a clear video with audio to explain my situation better. I&#39;ve didn&#39;t test it on 2023 because the project file is still in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this can be fixed on short terms.

<br/>
To replicate the issue (see video):<br/>
1) open the document<br/>
2) (make sure the rectangle is selected) look at the set record field values in the OIP<br/>
3) edit the record format:<br/>
   modify the popup list for &quot;16 Bauart&quot; (this could be any other popup): just remove some of one popup list item<br/>
   confirm OK OK OK<br/>
--&gt; watch most of the popup values change in the OIP to the first list item of the popups<br/>
<br/>
Something very odd is going on here.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that there is a problem with this specific record format definition - possibly caused by one or several conversions in the past. Is there some kind of work around for our VIP customer?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching both the original v2022 document of the customer and the small one with just a rectangle and a record format definition.

At the moment, they have to export the drawings as images from Vectorworks, take them into InDesign and create PDFs from there - this gives much better quality, and it makes the files much smaller.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re working in Windows, but I have the same issue on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Can we get a workaround on this until it&#39;s resolved? We have a continuous struggle with some people who want to move to Revit...<br/>

5) adjust the pattern --&gt; drawing pane freezes<br/>
For me Vectorworks wasn&#39;t frozen at this point as I could still interact with other parts of the application. For the customer Vectorworks froze as a whole and then got a black screen and MacOS crashed. When Vectorworks became unresponsive on my Mac I was able to force-quit it.<br/>
<br/>
The zip file contains two MacOS crash reports and the user folder, with which I was not able to replicate the issue again.<br/>
<br/>
The customer has been able to replicate this issue with this tile resource several times in VW28.0.1. I was able to replicate it once in VW28.0.3b and once in BW27.0.5.

<br/>
2 walls have a T connection and one side is separated in t 2 parts. That is fine. In the exported IFC (2x3) file both parts (green highlighted)  have the same BQ for NetSideArea = 7.03 sqm. This is fatal for further calculations. <br/>
<br/>
The internal Vectorworks worksheet shows the correct values.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is a clue, but when we look at the folder which we have saved the BCF file to, it has created a BCF folder. What&#39;s more, it has saved nested versions of that BCF folder. Please see image attached.<br/>

I have included the .BCF here but can give you access to the entire files via a shared dropbox folder if that would be more useful.

I believe this only happens when the chain dimension was originally a single dimension, which you then right click and choose &quot;Add Dimension&quot; to create the chain. When you create a chain dimension directly using the second mode of the Dimension tool, this bug doesn&#39;t occur.

This problem can result in many errors in drawings forcing users to abandon using viewport annotations or forcing them to examine many viewports and manually correcting them after editing the model.

                                            <td class="description">      Request for investigation <br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks2022 (series B) is started with a LAN cable connected, it may crash several tens of seconds after startup.<br/>
Would you please give us some information on what causes this and how to fix it?<br/>
<br/>
◎Customer&#39;s machine environment, etc.<br/>
OS: Windows 10<br/>
Network:<br/>
It uses a closed network called &quot;LGWAN&quot; that can only be used within national, prefectural and local governments.<br/>
<br/>
◎Remarks<br/>
-Occurs when VW2022 is started with a LAN cable connected. If VW2022 is started with the LAN cable disconnected, there is no problem, but if the LAN cable is connected after startup, the amount of memory used by WV2022 increases rapidly and eventually crashes.<br/>
*Please refer to &quot;Task Manager.png&quot; for the state of the sudden increase in memory usage.<br/>
<br/>
-When starting Vectorworks for the first time after connecting a LAN cable, the Vectorworks account sign-in screen was not displayed.<br/>
<br/>
-In the safe mode of the OS, the error &quot;Failed to create the safe-pipe socket with error 10050/WSAENETWOWN....&quot; is displayed and VW cannot be started.<br/>
*Please refer to &quot;Safemode.png&quot; for the state of the error.<br/>
<br/>
-The customer has previously used VW2015 series B, and there is no problem with VW2015 even in the same machine environment. Therefore, there is a possibility that the specification change after VW2016 is affecting this issue.<br/>

Everything is visually frozen on all open windows and I need to restart VW.<br/>
<br/>
This has been happening in v2022, perhaps before, but it&#39;s very difficult to catch, record and replicate. It&#39;s one I&#39;d really like to nail though because it&#39;s quite disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
I will try and capture it with screen recording and post a test file.

Update from Andy Broomell:<br/>
Okay okay okay......... I think I just found repeatable steps!!!!<br/>
<br/>
3064_IntCrownChicken_230120_WorkingFile_V06_AEB.vwx<br/>
<br/>
Download this file, and double check that &quot;Unable Legacy 2D Features&quot; and &quot;Turn off Unified view&quot; are both UNchecked.<br/>
<br/>
In the Nav Palette, the Design Layer called &quot;Crown Chicken&quot; is Active. Right click the other Design Layer called &quot;SKP Import&quot; and choose Duplicate. Then choose both &quot;SKP Import&quot; and &quot;SKP Import-2&quot; Layers, right click, and choose Delete. Those layers are removed and you&#39;re taken to the Sheet Layer &quot;Letter&quot; as the Active Layer. At this point, check Document Preferences and you&#39;ll see that there is now a checkmark next to &quot;Turn Off Unified View.&quot; And if you make another Design Layer, it operates independentlly from &quot;Crown Chicken&quot; indicating that Unified View is indeed turned off. This should not be possible since &quot;Enable Legacy 2D Features&quot; is turned off.<br/>
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br/>
<br/>
Somehow in the last 24 hours Unified View turned itself OFF in the attached filed. This shouldn&#39;t even be possible since legacy 2D features are disabled (and always have been) in this file.<br/>
<br/>
I first noticed that navigating in 3D on a single Design Layer was incredibly slow, then when I turned on my other Design Layers I discovered the issue with Unified View being &#39;off.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
How did this happen?<br/>
<br/>
(For now I&#39;ve fixed the issue by turning on legacy 2D features, unchecking the Turn Off Unified View checkbox, then turning legacy 2D features back off.)

You should be able to dock the palettes and save that. On Windows, the palettes are already docked, and I don&#39;t experience this problem. So it really seems to be a Mac related problem.<br/>

Vectorworks should regulate the login in a different way, so no change in permission settings are needed.

ccustomer has updated to Ventura OS 13.1 has the Home Screen does not works. He sees no content especially the Recent Files. And after a short while Vectorworks crashed.<br/>
Current workaround for the customer is not to use Home Screen.<br/>
I attach crash log file.<br/>
<br/>
We do have Ventura too here at ComputerWorks Germany, but cannot reproduce it.

<br/>
This issue was initially logged as Mac only, but then I was able to reproduce on Windows. I&#39;m attaching a video of how it behaves on Windows. The video shows the following sequence.<br/>
 # The application is open to the Home Screen.<br/>
 # An instance of Chrome is already running.<br/>
 # Sample Files is clicked.<br/>
 # *The correct (filtered) results are loaded on the web page.<br/>
 # Chrome is closed.<br/>
 # Sample Files is clicked again.<br/>
 # Chrome is launched, initially with the correct URL.<br/>
 # The URL changes to the default course page.<br/>
 # The incorrect (unfiltered) courses are loaded.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be consistent behavior. On Mac, however, I still cannot produce the correct results by already having Chrome running.

The recently switched from 2021 to 2022 and ran into this when testing the new version.<br/>
<br/>
Situation is, that you create a grid of lines and use it for curating plans and layout on sheet layer. If you create a sheet layer viewport in the scale of the design layers, then everything&#39;s fine. But I you change the scale the grid of grid lines does not really adjust its dimensions to the new scale and the grid looks out of shape. See video.<br/>
<br/>
With respect to the common workflow of using grids in architecture, we consider this a bug. A bug with very high priority.<br/>
If you don&#39;t call it bug, then please make it a wish with a very high priority.<br/>

Note:  The original user file (I can attach if needed) was first created in Vectorworks 2022 and brought forward to 2023.  The interior stem wall indicated is suspect to having the file crash on file open in VW2023 SP1. While that original file no longer crashes on open in VW VW28.0.2(677773), copying the two walls into a new file does.<br/>
<br/>
Tested (and crashes) in:<br/>

Open the file and you have a crash. The problem could be in a wall<br/>

<br/>
In the attached file there are two sets of walls, which are using the same Wall Style, but one set of walls is textured By Component and the other set is textured By Object.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a Data Vis which is set up to replace &quot;Wall Framing RT&quot; with &quot;Carpet Red RT.&quot; Try enabling the Data Vis and you&#39;ll see that it doesn&#39;t work correctly on any of the walls:<br/>
<br/>
Issue 1: Walls which are textured By Component get entirely replaced with &quot;Carpet Red RT&quot; instead of only the wall component that had the &quot;Wall Framing RT&quot; texture.<br/>
<br/>
Issue 2: Walls which are textured By Object get the *wrong* Part replaced. The Data Vis is replacing the &quot;Paint White RT&quot; on the Right side of the wall instead of the &quot;Wall Framing RT&quot; on the Left side of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the VWX file, there are screengrabs showing 1) the original model, 2) the Data Vis applied showing erroneous results, and 3) the expected results which I&#39;ve re-textured manually.

Please, see the video attached.<br/>

I have a Material with a Texture. I edit the Material, change its fill (note it still shows that it has a Texture), close the dialog. The preview does not have the texture. This is expected, we cannot draw it. If I reopen the Edit dialog, the texture is still there.<br/>
<br/>
Now I do Save and commit, and open the file on Windows.<br/>
<br/>
The Material has texture None. I think this is incorrect, we should preserve the texture even if textures are disabled at the moment.

In the enclosed file and movies you can see the animation path and when previewed in Vectorworks you see that it is relatively close to the stage area.<br/>

When rendered locally a movie is produced as expected. I have included this movie &#39;local&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
However, when an animation is produced using the Vectorworks Cloud Services with the same settings, the perspective is *completely* wrong! It is so far away it is wider than a wide perspective. <br/>

We have tried looking into everything we could, and came up short. He then looked into the background processes (I had mentioned it could be something conflicting with VW) and found Adobe Creative Cloud was a startup app running in the background. He disabled it opening at startup and isn&#39;t opening it himself, and now his freezing/rebooting has stopped. I have attached his system report and a file he created that describes what he is doing when it freezes and reboots.

The video is also posted in this thread: <br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/99032-setting-window-elevation-major-issue-or-am-i-crazy/]<br/>
<br/>
Basically, when a window object has its size reference set to &quot;Sash Opening&quot; the 3D window is being drawn at the wrong elevation compared to the &quot;Elevation&quot; that you set in the OIP. The elevation that you determine should be at the sash opening (same as INSIDE of the jamb), however the window is currently drawn with the elevation at the OUTSIDE of the jamb (or the overall unit size). So for example if the jamb is 3/4&quot; of an inch thick, the window ends up either 3/4&quot; too high or too low in the wall, depending if you&#39;re setting the elevation at Head or Sill of window.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023 this issue is highlighted by the placement of the blue editing handles, which appear misaligned with the 3D window. However the handles are in the &#39;correct&#39; spot and it&#39;s the window geometry which is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this affects other size reference configurations other than &quot;Sash Opening&quot; since that&#39;s is the only one I use. I briefly tried &quot;Unit Size&quot; just now and that one seems to work as expected.<br/>
<br/>
Once it&#39;s fixed the goal should be that you can set the head of the window to 6&#39;-8&quot; and it would be at the exact same elevation as a 6&#39;-8&quot; door. File attached to demonstrate that this currently doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to also share Don Seidel&#39;s blunt but accurate comment from the thread: &quot;Yes... longtime bug. VW users would expect this bug to be embarrassing enough as to get an immediate fix...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
When editing an animation path object as you can see in the movie and file, after a while the OIP stops reflecting what is going on in the drawing. It goes blank in this instance although I tried again in the latest public beta in the 2nd short movie and instead of going blank it simply remains as if the animation path was still selected.<br/>

This was after activating the camera view and having a second window open. I have enclosed a screenshot of the size of that window.<br/>

It seems like this problem is worse than ever, but if I have a wrapper inside a Marionette object, then that wrapper gets corrupted when trying to unwrap that object. This results in the wires not being connected even if they appear to be so, and when trying to reconnect them, Vectorworks crashes. In the two files attached, Wind Rose v2023 sp1 is the style after it has been unwrapped and worked on. I was trying to unwrap all the wrappers and reconnect them to the network. Vectorworks crashed at least 4 times will trying to do this. The other file is the marionette style before being unwrapped and edited.

This could either be a bug in the SDK or an issue with documentation (RenderOptionsValues.h line 384).<br/>

I&#39;m flagging this as High, as if this is an SDK bug, I would need to know in enough time pre-release to change. If this is just a documentation issue, than the priority is lower, but it should be a very easy fix.

<br/>
I double clicked on a dimension (created in VW2022) to change its length by changing the dimension value. This resulted in the dimension lines ghosting blue, no control handles appeared. The text of the dimension cannot be changed.<br/>
<br/>
In fact...<br/>
<br/>
Many things in the drawing no longer behave as expected. The menu items grey out. The key pad no longer controls the 3D views. Each keypad entry causes the screen to pan left. <br/>
<br/>
Tools still seem to work. The menu items do not work using the key stroke combinations command Q, command S etc.<br/>
<br/>
I had to force quit vectorworks. I realized on recreating the bug that I could quit by using the mouse to activate the menu commands.<br/>
<br/>
*Strangely, if one file is open the dimensions seem to edit with a double click. In other subsequently opened files, the dimensions will not edit. They will blue ghost and create havoc.* <br/>
<br/>
In the last movie you can see I open a file and test the dimension. It will edit as expected. I then created a new document and attempted to edit the dimension. It does not work.<br/>
<br/>
I would classify this as one of the worst bugs I have seen - because it is easy to cause and it debilitates the program.

In this file you can see that the heights of several components of some walls are wrong.<br/>

I&#39;ve been trying to convert Oranj file to 2023 but the file will not open or batch convert. The issue seems to happen at the point of updating Walls - this is where the converting stops and I have to force quit.<br/>

Gosh this is strange. I have only one user account on this new machine. Only one installation of 2023. <br/>
I did do a full installation of our SP4 with a renamed user folder for testing for our release soon of SP4. I was drawing in that version and saved a file.<br/>
<br/>
I then went back to 2023 which was open and was working fine. I opened the 2022 file and it converted it. I selected the Spotlight Blended Screen object and got the message about &quot;Vectorworks can not save the preferences!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Eventually I quit then reopened. I then get a message about it needing re-activation and click ok. I then get the message about the fact it has been activated too many times and will quit. However it does open.<br/>
When I then open the file (and converts it to 2023) I get the next message saying that it is running in Evaluation mode and can&#39;t be saved! If I then click OK it quits!!<br/>
<br/>
File and screenshots and movie and user folder enclosed. I deleted the Vectorworks user folder and the same thing happens! <br/>
<br/>
I am going to run the uninstaller and re-install from scratch as I am unable to run it. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

Meanwhile I tell the customer to update to 2022 SP5.<br/>

                Windows - multi-line text objects lose linebreaks, render garbled overlaid text

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      UPDATE: this bug is caused by some data corruption in AppData\Roaming\Nemetschek\Vectorworks\2023 folder. When it occurs, the bug will happen in any 28.0.x build on the local machine (does not seem to be due to a certain code change). Renaming/removing the data folder will correct the issue.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, once data is in the state:<br/>
 # Open sample .rtf file in WordPad; select and copy all text<br/>
 # Create new VectorWorks document<br/>
 # Activate text tool and create a new text object, active for edit<br/>
 # Paste the copied multi-line rtf text<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: The copied rich text pastes into the text object with linebreaks and styles intact<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the pasted text is badly formatted all on one line, with multiple lines of content overlapping<br/>
<br/>
Also, this can actually happen simply by trying to type into a text object that has been sized with wrapping enabled - it is not specifically related to paste, it&#39;s a general issue with the text engine failing to insert linebreaks as it renders the text.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this is a difficult state to get into (I&#39;ve run many different 2023 beta builds etc. through many changes of the software, including localization testing, without removing my data folder). Nonetheless I think the severity of this bug makes it worth continuing to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a 7-zip archive of the data folder that produced the issue.

The best I can get it to do is 620&#39; It will not scale to 62&#39; even with subsequent commands to scale it.<br/>

Edit - This happens ALWAYS in the attached file. I imported it into a different blank document and it seems to work correctly there.

<br/>
Hatches with a high detail level have an annoying graphic problem by a zoom in/ out. At a certain zoom level, the graphics build-up is quite jerky and can even lead to a crash, depending on the computer hardware. May you can test ist good with the zoom tool (interactive mode).<br/>

I&#39;ve attached a test file and a screen movie.<br/>

<br/>
• Pasted into the VP from elsewhere, or<br/>
<br/>
• Created using the Paint bucket mode of the 2D Polygon tool.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The issues that occur might include:<br/>
<br/>
• Inability to mirror these objects (the mirrored copy ends up in the same spot as the original). Example file below.<br/>
<br/>
• Moving the viewport leaves the object in its original place (it doesn&#39;t move with the viewport) OR the object moves a different vector than the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
• Other oddities like the object suddenly being rotated 90° and moved way off to the side.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a file that exhibits the issue where I can&#39;t mirror an object. Open the file, double click the viewport, select the dashed small circle representing the hinge, then try mirroring it using the second mode of the mirror tool. The duplicate ends up right where the original was.

With 2 lower extrudes one with textures set to cast shadows and one not cast shadows. When a point source is placed above them they behave as intended one casts shadows and one does not. However, when the point source is removed and replaced by an extrude with a glow texture applied. Both extrudes cast shadows irrespective of their settings.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that they are very different light sources but cast shadows should function when stipulated through the edit texture dialogue, Hence I am listing this as a bug.

 4) recalculate the shown worksheet (&quot;Aktive Tabelle aktualisieren&quot;)<br/>
 &gt; the formula =IF((PON=&#39;SLAB&#39;); AREA; &#39;--&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
does not work and shows us &#39;--&#39;<br/>
<br/>
According to the replies on VB-189661 this formula should work.<br/>
<br/>
If this is not a bug, then what is the solution?

I took her file and created new section elevations as well as new interior elevations and in all cases the new viewports will merge elements.  No changes to the original interior elevations will allow the objects to merge as expected.

                Data Bar input sometimes fails in 3d view
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This one is a little complicate to describe. I have attached a video, and the file, which should help.<br/>
<br/>
Entering values into the Data Bar (tab to field; type in value; hit return to lock) is one of the most useful features. It works more or less flawlessly in Top/Plan View. However I often have trouble with it in 3d views. In this example I am in a straight-on frontal view and tying to draw a line of a specific length, along the angle of the edge of an extrude (a modeled rafter, or truss). As you will see in the video, I get inconsistent results. This is not new to this version or build. I have encountered it frequently in previous versions.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of the functionality is that once the user-desired value has been entered, the value creates a visible, highlighted constraint. And that once the content has been &quot;locked&quot;, the next (or final) mouse click, to end the drawing operation, should create an object (in this case a line) in which the final result(in this case the length) never varies from the user-inputted value. As you can see in the video this is often not the case.<br/>
<br/>
If my use of the future is incorrect please advise as to how to correct it.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need more info, and thanks.

1. It is impossible to select all objects at once - VW always crashes (see Crushdump file in attachments)<br/>
2. It is possible to select less than half of the map, but most operations end up with no respond (black screen or just crash).<br/>
<br/>
Client complains that it is almost impossible to work in a file with this dxf in 2022, but it turns out the same dxf works much smoother in 2021 - none of above issues take place.<br/>
<br/>
For now I advised to use dxf file as reference, to not import in directly to VW, but Client wants to know where is a problem.<br/>
In attachments: dxf file, Crushdump file<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
###IMPORTANT### dxf file is for tests only, Client expects to delete it after tests and keep it confidential.

I am unable to provide exact steps to reproduce the issue.  However this seems pretty bad once it occurs.  It usually crashes Vectorworks and corrupts my User Folder.  I am unable to launch Vectorworks again until I delete my User Folder for 2023.  Included my 2023 User Folder.<br/>

This only seemed to occur in Windows, so far I am not able to reproduce it on MacOS<br/>

Was this change was deliberate or not? If not, it might make sense to revert back to the &#39;old&#39; behavior. If this is a deliberate change, we need arguments to explain the customer why it happened.

<br/>
See the user file supplied. The &#39;Surfaces&#39; Design Layer contains 2000 objects, but they are all efficiently-drawn 2D polygon or polyline objects and rectangles, etc. Many of these objects have Hatches applied as well as Line Types. When you open this file on Windows and navigate to the &#39;Surfaces&#39; Design Layer, you&#39;ll see in Task Manager memory consumption increases a massive amount, then after a lot of processing will decrease. (See attached screenshot series). <br/>
<br/>
The user&#39;s computer has 16GB of RAM and it crashes every time doing this process. Mine has 32GB and manages to get through despite RAM maxing out and the &#39;Committed Memory&#39; (extended memory on the hard drive) reaching 68GB! <br/>
<br/>
After changing the Line and Fill attributes to &#39;Solid&#39; for all objects on this Design Layer, the file performs great. <br/>
<br/>
I thought the way Vectorworks displayed repeatable geometry (such as symbols, hatches and line types) was done in an efficient way, something like: One instance of the pattern is stored in memory, then Vectorworks tells the graphics card the scale and extents inside which to repeat the pattern. In theory this should be very efficient, at least compared to defining the geometry for every location the pattern should appear. So why is this so terribly resource hungry? The graphics card doesn&#39;t seem to working very hard at all and while the VRAM consumption is among the highest I&#39;ve seen for a file, it seems super low _compared to the [main] memory consumption_. <br/>

<br/>
The only thing I did observe is that they return the same values in VW2020 as they do in VW 2019, but only if you input the broken values generated by ModelVecToScreenVec(), and ModelPt2DToScreenPt(). Therefore, it stands to reason, if you input real Screen coordinates from the rotated Plan, you will not get the Model coordinates you are expecting.<br/>

Please see: (*VB-186726) VS ModelVecToScreenVec() &amp; ModelPt2DToScreenPt() return incorrect values in VW 2020 and newer*<br/>

                Project Sharing - Checkout Dialog Appears When Attributes Palette Menus are Expanded (Mac Only)

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Select the Rectangle<br/>
-In the Attributes palette, click on the three-dot buttons to expand either the fill mapping menu or the Drop Shadows menu<br/>
<br/>
Note that, as soon as you click on the button, the object checkout dialog appears and the Attributes palette menu flashes briefly then disappears.<br/>
<br/>
This feels pretty awkward from a usability perspective since it forces the user to have to expand the Attributes palette menu again once they&#39;ve confirmed the checkout. <br/>
<br/>
If I try this on Windows the checkout dialog doesn&#39;t show until an actual change is made to the mapping, and the mapping menu remains expanded even after the checkout is done. Ideally this would work the same way on Mac.<br/>

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
 # Select the Wall tool<br/>
 # Open the Wall Preferences dialog<br/>
 # Choose a Wall Style<br/>
 # Click the &quot;Wall Closure at Inserts&quot; button<br/>
 # Go to the Wrapping tab (Screenshot.png)<br/>
*BUG:*  The checkmark shown in the Core column is read-only and cannot be changed.  However, it does not display grayed to indicate that.<br/>
 # Click in the &quot;Wrap&quot; column for the first two components (rows) in the list browser so that they select with a checkmark icon.<br/>
Note:  All items in the columns to the right of the checkmark will enable and allow editing.<br/>
 # Click to select (with a checkmark) the items in the Wrap to Insert and the next column to the right.<br/>
 # Now click in the &quot;Wrap&quot; column for the second component (row) in the list browser so that it deselects (no checkmark).<br/>
*BUG:*  All items to the right of the &quot;Wrap&quot; column will become disabled but the two checkmark icons re not grayed and appear to be editable.  They should be grayed like the other items.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This issue makes the UI confusing and makes understanding the behaviors of these controls very difficult.

We got the next answer from tech support:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hi Yana,<br/>
<br/>
I have seen something similar a few years ago that was caused by missing Windows components, specifically Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables. Can you send me a list of their installed applications and their dxdiag.txt so I can investigate?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

We sent the required information, but didn&#39;t get any answer last month, despite a reminder. That&#39;s why I bring this case straight to Jira, since I don&#39;t know where else to look for answers.

<br/>
we do have an urgent case here from a german customer with 21 licences of Vectorworks.<br/>
On thursday they have to hand out the plans.<br/>
Unfortunately they cannot create their plan by PDF.<br/>
<br/>
See attached customer file KES_AP_BIM.vwx.<br/>
Go to sheet layer LP5 Ansicht Nord/Süd and try to update viewport Süd-6 (which is the bottom one).<br/>
Vectorworks memory can easily go over 100 GB and after an hour or so you can only quit Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
I tracked it down to an plug-in (i hope so).<br/>
But there are plug-ins in great number in this file.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please find out how to repair this file.<br/>
Like said before, latest on thursday (our time) we need a solution for the customer.<br/>
The customer need to compose his plans in sheet layers and create PDF.<br/>
This is why I send this file to you with the request for help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and regards Klaus Lüttich

In the standard orientation, the viewport renders all geometry in top hidden line.  When that viewport is rotated 90 degrees and updated, geometry disappears.

                Importing/replacing a Plug-in Object Style with the same as one already in the document for a different type of Plug-in object causes the original Style to be deleted and all instances of that style become unstyled.
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The behavior described in this VB began with change 668533 submitted to Mainline (to fix VB-178619).  This change is is dealing with the end result of the Resource Resolution System and helps to prevent objects from becoming corrupt by using a PIO designed for a different PIO type.  While the change helps, the end result is not good for users.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce the problem:<br/>
 # Create a new blank document.<br/>
 # Place an unstyled instance of a stylable Plug-in object (eg: a Base Cabinet).<br/>
 # Right-click on the object and use the &quot;New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in…&quot; context menu command to create a style with a simple name.<br/>
 # Create another new blank document.<br/>
 # Place an unstyled instance of another type of stylable Plug-in object (eg: a Utility Cabinet).<br/>
 # Right-click on the object and use the &quot;New Plug-in Style from Unstyled Plug-in…&quot; context menu command to create a style with the same name as the one in the first document.<br/>
 # Go back to the first document and use the Resource Manager to import the style from the second document.  &quot;The Resource Name Conflict&quot; dialog will appear.<br/>
 # In the &quot;Resource Name Conflict&quot; dialog, choose the option to &quot;Replace the symbol definition in the current document&quot; and click OK.<br/>
<br/>
Notice the imported Style replaces the old one and all instances of that Style become unstyled.  This problem can easily go unnoticed and cause problems later in the project.  Users will have to recreate the PIO style (which can be very difficult for PIOs with many parameters), then they need to figure out which unstyled PIOs scattered throughout the model had the original Style and apply the new Style.

*If the problem doesn&#39;t reproduce, try zooming with the mouse wheel.<br/>
 (It would reproduce when re-rendering.)<br/>
<br/>
*We have tested with several PCs. <br/>
When tested with &quot;Dynabook S73/DP&quot;, an alert that says &quot;Aborted rendering due to the following error. Failed to allocate necessary GPU recyclable memory. aborting the render&quot; shows. (See &quot;Alert.png&quot;)<br/>

When other users opened the plant the field visibilites had not come across. They had all refreshed the libraries (the plant was there and had the other changes she had made)<br/>
<br/>
When the Plant Library manager edited another plant she found it now had the same field visibilites.<br/>
<br/>
This implies that this is a machine setting rather than a style setting. That is not necessarrily bad but it is not obvious. Also it would be good if resource managers could dictate this and roll it out across all computers without each user having to set it up seperately (as they had to do)

Steps to reproduce<br/>
<br/>
1) Place a truss with the truss tool.<br/>
2) Enable the Auto Connect option on the tool bar.<br/>
3) Close the cursor to the placed truss, a highlighted preview that indicates the connect direction of trusses shows, but the shape of the line is different from Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>
Our users are confusing due to this difference. They say it&#39;s hard to see that which direction we should place a connect truss.<br/>
<br/>
We feel it should be easier to see the direction of connect trusses, the same with Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>
*In our environment, the following truss symbols are confirmed that shapes of the preview direction line are different from Vectorworks 2021.<br/>

<br/>
I have official url from the city of Berlin.<br/>
https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/?loginkey=showMap&amp;mapId=wmsk_alkis@senstadt<br/>
<br/>
Link WMS<br/>

<br/>
Link WFS<br/>
https://fbinter.stadt-berlin.de/fb/wfs/data/senstadt/s_wfs_alkis_gebaeudeflaechen<br/>
<br/>
WMS does work pretty fine while WFS obviously does not work.<br/>
There&#39;s a really big amount of data behind those url. So my question, is there a limitation of data in Vectorworks?<br/>
The freeware QGIS on the other side can handle the data. It takes about an hour to read (download) all the data, but then the downloaded buildings are all visible.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks tells me, that unsupported service type. How can that be? These are official url from the city of Berlin.<br/>
Could you please have a look?<br/>
Is it due to a limitation of data size? Or is the service really unsupported.<br/>
Either case, please solve this for Vectorworks.<br/>
If a freeware like QGIS can read those data, Vectorworks should also do this.<br/>
<br/>
See attached video and customer file.<br/>

It is a WFS often used in the Netherlands and contains 3D objects.<br/>

&quot;The 3D BAG is an up-to-date data set containing 3D building models of the Netherlands. The 3D BAG is open data. It contains 3D models at multiple levels of detail, which are generated by combining two open data sets: the building data from the BAG and the height data from the AHN. The 3D BAG is updated regularly, keeping it up-to-date with the latest openly available building stock and elevation information.([https://docs.3dbag.nl/en/)]<br/>
<br/>
This is what it looks like online: https://www.arcgis.com/home/webscene/viewer.html?webscene=abd5e3c4b173417f8c14f1283dee33c6<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am guessing cause it needs to import 2 datasets?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We often get the question from clients why they can not use this URL.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the term &#39;WFS&#39; in the URL gives the wrong impression it can be read in Vectorworks. Checking the ArcGIS online options it seems to be listed as a Map Service.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Could you help me finding an informed answer why this is so?<br/>

I had expected the cable to follow my path exactly. It did not. In the attached screenshot, the distributor is labeled A, and the breakout is labeled B. The green arrows indicate the path itself. The highlighted red line indicates the cable. It took various shortcuts to get from the distributor to the breakout.<br/>
<br/>
The behavior I had expected was to have the cable follow the path that connected the two objects.<br/>
<br/>
The only workaround is to manually draw every cable.

                DOM: Marionette Stile, Script Update regenerates PIOs too much

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I think it is hard on the limit of Bug or WAD. As far As I can see, we regenerate die PIOs times (even more if we have path objects) 3 times.<br/>
<br/>
1. When we Enter the script via Style Window (Exit Dialog in fact)<br/>
2. When we leave the Script Re-Enter the Style Dialog<br/>
3. When we Exit the Stile Dialog when we Exit with OK<br/>
<br/>
What maybe could be improved<br/>
1. By Edit the Script the dialog window saves the settings of the dialog but do not regenerate the PIOs<br/>
2. By leaving the Script the Dialog settings are also applied and the dialog is not shown again.<br/>
3. Implementing to edit the Script without enter the Dialog. <br/>
<br/>
I understand that the logic of the dialog and the edit button inside the Dialoge produces this behavior as WAD but maybe you have a god Idea to prevent the amount of Marionette PIO Updates.<br/>

<br/>
There is a counter (record) attached to the pio which adds +1 by moving or resetting the counter count +1. If I edit the path the counter count +1. <br/>
<br/>
Also the issue could be that the script needs longer to execute, because it does everything twice instead of one. Is there any workaround? I played around with objectvariableboolean 1167 but without success.<br/>
<br/>
Attached a movie &quot;Example Usage.mp4&quot; which shows what I wanted to do. The Script tracks if a point is new, moved or replaced. This will not work because the script runs always twice if I edit the path.<br/>
<br/>
Also tested with 2023 Beta. Same behaviour.

</td>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Mirror the member as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that everything looks fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now edit the style and click OK without making any changes<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the start/end conditions get flipped for the mirrored object.<br/>
<br/>
In a way this is working correctly, since mirroring an SM causes its start/end to swap by design. Ideally though the swapped state would show immediately after the mirror operation instead of showing it only after the next style edit.<br/>

<br/>
However the Previous and Next buttons behave erratically. You have to click Previous more than once to get back to the prior visualization. Also Next does not become enabled to bring you back forward.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Open the attached document - note that there are two layers and data visualization is set to None.<br/>
 # In the data visualization list drop-down from the view bar, select Layer Visualization 1 - you should see the Layer 1 objects become red<br/>
 # Now select Layer Visualization 2 - you should see the Layer 2 objects become blue<br/>
 # Now click the Back button<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the document switches back to the Layer 1 (red) visualization, then you can click back again to go back to None, or click forward to go back to Layer 2 (blue), etc.<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the first click does nothing, but the back button stays enabled; if you click it again (or maybe a couple of times) it will finally work at bringing you back to the Layer 1 visualization, but now the forward button is disabled. You actually have to click back many more times (4 or 5) to get back to &quot;None&quot;, and again the forward button is disabled.<br/>
<br/>
So in general, Back and Forward are broken with data visualization navigation, but it seems like they were intended to work.<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: happens on both Mac and Windows

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
as architect, I work a lot with walls, we can say the wall-tool is one of the most<br/>
important tools for me in everyday use.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I found a bug, or maybe it is w-a-d (works as designed),<br/>
but this bothers me since years and I want to have it fixed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The bug is related to the commands “Move” and “Move 3D” +<br/>
walls with Wall-Joints (L- or T-Joints).<br/>
<br/>
If I move my walls to a new position, I want to use the “Move” or<br/>
“Move 3D” command, because I find it better to move by command<br/>
instead of move by mouse.<br/>
<br/>
Side note:<br/>
If you move walls by mouse, you don&#39;t get the bug I describe here!<br/>
<br/>
… but if you move your walls with the above-mentioned commands,<br/>
all capped Joints will be overwritten to uncapped Joints and you<br/>
have to reconnect the walls.<br/>
<br/>
This shouldn&#39;t happen!<br/>
I think this behavior isn&#39;t intended to the commands!<br/>
<br/>
Attached you find a video + test document.<br/>
<br/>
In the video, I show only T-Joints,<br/>
but L-Joints are also affected<br/>
<br/>
Please fix this bug that existed for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>

<br/>
It is quite difficult to link a 2D/ 3D locus with the data tag. Sometimes it works but it feels more like luck to catch a locus with the mouse cursor if you use the second method &quot;Single Eligible Objects Mode&quot;. With the fourth method &quot;Selected Eligible Object Mode&quot; the loci are recognized. It would be nice if the loci are also recognized by the data tag with all methods.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached my test file and a screen video. <br/>

I created a new blank file and imported 3 hardscape styles.<br/>
<br/>
I double clicked on each of the styles and placed a small hardscape using the Hardscape tool.  In each case the name of the placed hardscape was &quot;Hardscape-1&quot;.  in previous versions the hardscape name would match the name of the hardscape used to create the style and this is the expected behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
I duplicated the three hardscapes and then dragged the style definition (from the resource browser) over each of them.  The hardscape name now changes to the name used in the hardscape to create the style definition (which is the expected behaviour).

<br/>
The hardscape style remembers the Hardscape Name of the Hardscape Object used to create it.  <br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in the &quot;Edit Style&quot; dialog boxes is one given an option to edit the Hardscape Name associated with that hardscape style.  At least no where I can find.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little problematic when one wished to change the name associated with a style.  The workaround is to place a hardscape object using that style.  Edit the name of the placed hardscape object, and then create a new style with the new name.  This is somewhat cumbersome.

Martyn:<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if we could improve the initial experience of the Geolocate tool for users by finding a way of automatically zooming out to an area large enough that is typically deemed acceptable for the tool. Certainly for Architecture, I have a feeling that many users would be too closely zoomed in for the tool to be able to create a valid image and so continuously get a ‘Image Failed to Generate image’. For example, if I am opening any of the Architectuture templates, I would typically be working at a nominal scale of 1:50 and a Zoom level of 100%. I am finding that I fairly consistently have to zoom out to level of about 1% before the Geoimage will generate.<br/>
<br/>

Katarina:<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a good idea - I agree that I often have to do the same, even if I’m working on a 1:100 or 1:200 scale

When adding the column &#39;Image&#39; to these Reports (where the criterium is set to search for Plant record) the image option no longer works. Vectorworks seems not capable of reading the Image data for that specific Plantstyle used within a Landscape area.<br/>

I had expected the cable to follow the cable path inherently built into truss objects.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached video, I show my placing a cable starting at a distributor, then specifically clicking on a cable path followed by an intentional click upon a truss line and then finishing at four breakout distributors. Upon completion, the cables follow the cable path but ignore the truss and my intentionally placed routing point upon the truss.<br/>
<br/>
In the second half of the video, I placed an additional cable path as an overlay upon the truss, resulting in the cable as I had expected.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that our cable layout workflow does not need to include adding cable paths over truss. Perhaps we need to rethink that approach.

<br/>
In the attached document and screenshots for example, we&#39;re trying to select all windows with a Height value of 6&#39;0&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work when using that value or the inches (78, 78&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not sure if this is expected behavior; it&#39;s possible this field wasn&#39;t meant to be used for Custom Selections/modifications, but it would be helpful if it worked in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this happens for all Plug-in Objects or just windows, but can look into this behavior further if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance and have an awesome day! :)

<br/>
The intent is to store the value from the database header row cell B3 into a worksheet cell and then use a reference to that worksheet cell as part of a calculation in cell C3.<br/>
<br/>
Check and see that the formula in cells A1, B5, D1, and D5 are each =B2. They should all be displaying 2996.48.<br/>
<br/>
Edit the formula in database header cell C3 to be = B3/B5.  The expected result is to divide the individual subrow values by the total of all the subrows to get a percentage. <br/>
<br/>
The actual result is that cell B5 switches to displaying zero (0) even though the formula continues to show as =B3. That zero value is then used in the calculation in C3 resulting in the wrong value (either 0 or a Div by Zero error) showing in each of the subrows.<br/>
<br/>
The same conversion of the displayed and used value being switched to Zero occurs no matter what spreadsheet cell is used in the calculation if it reference a value from the database header row.<br/>
<br/>
It does not matter what mathematical function is used, the value transferred in is zero.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I exported back to VW2022 and still saw the same result.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The expected result is that using a spreadsheet cell as a go between to take a database header total and use it in further calculations should work by using the value displayed in the spreadsheet cell, not zero.

I had expected cable paths snapped to truss objects to stay connected at both ends of the path itself. Not doing so will present problems for electricians and riggers as they make adjustments through the engineering process of their projects.

                Automatic Working Plane: Working Plane Rotation not always as Expected
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      A user on the forums (Tobias Kern) reported this problem to me and it&#39;s a pretty frustrating problem where the rotation of the auto working plane is unexpectedly rotated.  See attached videos.<br/>
----<br/>
The bug is related to the Working Plane (“Automatic Working Plane” + “Set Working Plane”).  If you see in this video with the cube, the “Working Plane” axis are not always placed right.  I would expect, that x+ is always facing to the right and y+ always facing upwards (relative to my viewing of the scene).  Mostly it is okay, but sometimes the axis are flipped (in cube video = left- and back-side).  You see, if you want to draw on the sides with the flipped axis, the drawings (in the video it was a text) orientate wrong.  As user, you always have to flip the axis manually on the wrong sides to have axis like expected.<br/>
<br/>
In the video with the cylinder, you see that the axis of the TOP working plane, does have also a wired behavior.  Sometimes the “Working Plane” (relative to my viewing), is also flipped, mostly if you try to set the WP from the left side.  Placing the “Working Plane” on the round side of the cylinder always works good!<br/>
<br/>
This bug/behavior is related to all modelling in 3D AND should be a high priority fix, because it bothers all work in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you understand my points and the need for a fix!<br/>
<br/>
Please help to fix this long-time-wrong-behavior!<br/>

It has a single par can lighting symbol. I wanted the beam to start further back in the body of the fixture. So I added a 3D loci and attached an emitter part of 1. This is grouped inside the geometry that makes up the body.<br/>
With Lit Fog enabled, you can see that the beam looks correct in the straight down home position, but once I start to tilt the fixture, the beam goes out of alignment with the body.

<br/>
When he moves the light to the pipe, the symbol shows the slash across the front of it/  When the light instrument is pulled off the lighting pipe, the slash disappears.<br/>
<br/>
I found if I move that device on the lighting design on the left, the schematic updates and keeps the slash in place.

4) Select the Lighting Device and Select the Mirror tool or the Move by Points.<br/>
Mirror: Duplicate Mode<br/>
Move by Points: Move and Duplicate mode or Distribute mode, plus Object Retention mode<br/>
5) Duplicate on the truss with Shift key. (To align the line with the original.)<br/>
6) The height of the duplicated Lighting Device is different from the original one.<br/>

On Windows, it seems to occur the problem when duplicated by the Mirror tool only.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Steps to Reproduce Speaker Insertion Alignment Bug:*<br/>
<br/>
1. Start from reboot (not necessary)<br/>
2. Launch Vectorworks<br/>
3. Create a new blank document<br/>
4. Change to Spotlight Workspace if not already there<br/>
5. Select the Speaker tool from the Event Design Tool Set<br/>
6. Select either Insert by Symbol Mode (selected by default) or Insert by Catalog Mode in Mode Bar (same behavior in both modes)<br/>
7. Select any speaker from Speaker Symbol or Catalog Item pull-down menu<br/>
8. Select Align Object Left Mode or Align Object Right Mode (same behavior in both modes)<br/>
9. Move cursor over easily observable point (e.g., Page Center): note that the dashed outline of the speaker matches the alignment mode selected<br/>
10. Click once to start the insertion process: note that the dashed outline of the speaker still matches the alignment mode selected<br/>
11. Click again to complete the insertion mode: note that the speaker inserted centered on the mouse click, though the outline will still show the correct alignment<br/>
12. Select another tool (e.g., the Selection tool)<br/>
13. Select the Speaker tool again<br/>
14. Move cursor over easily observable point (e.g., Page Center): note that the dashed outline of the speaker does NOT match the selected alignment mode<br/>
15. Click once to start the insertion process: note that the dashed outline of the speaker now matches the alignment mode selected<br/>
16. Click again to complete the insertion mode: note that the speaker inserted centered on the mouse click, and the outline will now show center alignment and NOT the selected alignment<br/>
<br/>
*Notes:*<br/>
It&#39;s unclear how far back the reversion goes:<br/>
 - Build 622768 behaves correctly<br/>
 - Builds 664120, 672648, 678727 and 676510 do not behave correctly<br/>
 - 27.0.6 (680324) and 28.0.2 (680333) on Win 11 (64-bit) do not behave correctly

Attached is a file with two lighting instrument symbols and one static accessory(barndoors).<br/>
 If I open the file and then also start a new document, I can add any of the lighting symbols into the new document by double clicking and then plotting them in the drawing.<br/>
 If I try to use the Accessory tool to add the barn doors to the instruments, and the barn door symbol is not already in the new document, Vectorworks crashes.<br/>
 Meaning the lighting instruments are already in the new document but the barn doors are not.<br/>
 Then I use the accessory tool and choose the barn doors symbol from the other document in the Resource Manager. It crashes.<br/>
 If I add the barn doors symbol to the drawing before using the accessory tool, then it does not crash.

In the attached screenshot, I am trying to mount a company switch on a line designated as a wall. I need to place it with a single-click method and edit the OIP rotation field.

In 2023, note that the view gets zoomed very far out. It looks like the Round Wall on the left is the one that has the large bounding box.<br/>
<br/>
If you move the objects 1448&#39; or less along the X-axis the problem won&#39;t happen, but if you move them 1449&#39; or more the problem will happen.

                Slab with Drainage refers to a different Z value (Z Offset) than entered

                                            <td class="description">      Hi Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
The Z Ref from the Slabs is on &quot;Ok-Fertigboden&quot; (Ref height in the story = 0.00). But they have a Z offset from -0.2475. The interesting part is, if I chance it to 0.00, the value first jumps to the number -18.67. Only in a second attempt does the floor jump to the value 0.00. If I draw a new slab with a drainage in this file, it insert it on the right height. <br/>
I&#39;ve attached a screen record that hopefully shows, what I mean in the description. <br/>
(The file is from version 2021. I converted it for testing in to 2022)<br/>
<br/>
If I compare the Value with the story elevation from the active design layer (ABS_ARC_GRN_OG3H_BOR / OG3H) it seems like the same number in the slab (minus values of Z ref.). If we look the the first value -0.2475, it is the same value like in the drainage (highest point). Maybe a possible theory is that the edit from the drainage moved the slab in the minus. Or the drainage was edited from a other layer like &quot;ABS_ARC_GRN_EG0H_BOR / EG0H&quot; and it calculate with the parameters from this layer. This may have caused the soil to be shifted so far down.<br/>
<br/>
I have not really found out the main reason for the occurrence. Although the workaround with the double input is easy to apply, I hope you can find out something more here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank for testing.<br/>
<br/>

I noticed when using the Curtain wall&#39;s &#39;Move Grid&quot; mode in the test file, VW freezes sometimes. This happens whether in a front of an isometric view. The behavior is not consistently reproducible; however, it&#39;s definitely there. <br/>

I understand the roofer object doesn&#39;t have a Z property (this should be fixed also), but the _*least*_ it can do is create itself at Active Layer Z = 0.0, not World Z = 0.0.<br/>

All 12 objects are part of the same Layer and Class.<br/>

The Viewport Annotations is empty.<br/>

If we export to PDF directly from the drawing, all 12 objects are exported with the correct colour. This problem only happens through the Viewport.<br/>

Please take a look why 10 of the 12 roof objects are being exported in green and not grey.

Reproduction example:<br/>
1) Open the sample file &quot;12849.vwx&quot;. In the drawing area, the placed &quot;Oval&quot; and the overlapping &quot;Line&quot; at the top of the Oval are displayed.<br/>
2) Select Split Tool and select &quot;Line Split Mode&quot; on the Tool bar.<br/>
3) Snap / click the &quot;Line&quot; Endpoint and snap / click the opposite Endpoint to disconnect.<br/>
4) Select the upper side of the disconnected Oval (Polyline) and delete it.<br/>
5) If zooming the overlapped part of the disconnected Oval (Polyline) and &quot;Line&quot;, when Zoom is about 60,000%, the overlap is displayed out of alignment. <br/>

If there is an roof element in a roof, the walls of the roof elements are displayed with texture in the design layer.<br/>
If there is a roof element in a roof face, the texture is not displayed in the design layer.<br/>
If you make a section viewport and render it at something else then OpenGL, the texture of the roof element is visible.<br/>

If you move the roof face in the design layer, the texture of the walls suddenly becomes visible.

                Wall End Cap Causes Large Bounding Box When Reset from a Sheet Layer
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Wall with a Wall End Cap.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Select the Wall and run the &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; command<br/>
<br/>
Note that the view fits correctly at this point.<br/>
<br/>
- Now switch to the sheet layer<br/>
- Run the Tools/Utilities/Reset All Plugins command<br/>
- Switch back to the design layer<br/>
- Select the Wall and run &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Wall has a large bounding box that causes the view to zoom way out. This seems to be related to the Wall End Cap.<br/>
<br/>
If you run &quot;Reset All Plugins&quot; again but on the design layer instead of the sheet, it&#39;ll fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to at least VW 2021, so this isn&#39;t related to Wall Modernization.

<br/>
There are two roofs in the attached file. Both Roofs are attached to the same walls in their extremities, one at each end of the roofs. Both Roofs have the same settings, but the wider / broader Roof is also attached to two walls more on its side.<br/>
<br/>
We can see that both Roofs are not displayed the same when looking at the lines on the sides, but if we remove the two walls (like shown in the video) that are on the side of the wider / broader Roof, then the display becomes exactly the same.<br/>
<br/>
We would expect that the display of both Roofs is the same, independent of how many walls each is attached to.

<br/>
In the attached file there is a Roof and a rectangle.<br/>
<br/>
1. Select the Roof and make sure that in the OI the Eave Cut is set to Horizontal.<br/>
2. Now select both objects and use the &quot;Add Surface&quot; command, like its shown in the video.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we can see that the side where the rectangle was added its with horizontal eave cut, as expected. The rest of the Roof side is with vertical eave cut, which we believe its not correct. The full side of the Roof should present a horizontal eave cut.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Go to any 3D view other than Top<br/>
- Activate the Split tool in Point Split Mode<br/>
- Split the Contour on the locus point<br/>
<br/>
Note that the object gets split in the wrong location. This only seems to happen when the split operation is done in a 3D, non-Top view.<br/>
<br/>
This looks like a general problem with the Split tool and not a Site Modifier bug. Other path-based plugins like Railing/Fence and Repetitive Unit show the same problem.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

You can test this by selecting a roof face, and entering in the OIP an angle value higher than 85°. Vectorworks will give a warning sound, and the value will be clipped to 85°. This is the correct behavior.<br/>
<br/>
However, an error occurs when changing the rise over run in such a way that a very steep roof is created. For instance, if:<br/>
<br/>
Rise = 100cm<br/>
Run = 2,54 cm (=1 inch)<br/>
<br/>
Then the roof face gets clipped (see attached screenshot).<br/>
The resulting angle is 88,60°.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t be possible to define a rise/run combination that exceeds a resulting 85° angles.<br/>
<br/>
When trying to do the same upon creation of the Roof Face, the dialog returns a warning (see attached screenshot).

Given a polyline with mixed vertex types, these upon conversion will be:<br/>
* corner: preserved<br/>
* arc: preserved only on dFuzz = 0, otherwise they turn into corner, which is truly strange, since the purpose IS to create arc vertexes<br/>
* radius: ignored, turn into corner<br/>
* cubic: turn into arc[s]<br/>
* bezier: turn into arc[s]<br/>
<br/>
Please test on the attached document, containing two scripts, one where it fails on radius vertexes, one where it fails on both arc and radius vertexes. Select one of the polylines in pink and run the scripts.

<br/>
In the split tool it can become an obstacle, if in the document settings &quot;Legacy 2D&quot; the unified view is adjusted, that display screen objects are no longer visible. The tool is blocked by this, because it depends on the screen layer. You get a hint when selecting, but it is difficult for may user to recognize the connection from the split tool to the screen plane.<br/>
However, since this only occurs when you edit the 2D Legacy settings, this is only conditionally a bug. However, the inconsistency exists as soon as you edit the unified view with the split tool active. In that case, you can turn off the screen layer visibility and continue to use the tool. It will only be locked once you select it again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached my test file and a screen movie.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
- Allow the user to set a Roof Height value in a dialog box.<br/>
- After confirming the value, allow the user to define the location in the drawing where the value should be applied. The user gets a special cursor to do this (crosshair).<br/>
<br/>
It is this second step that seems to be failing. Clicking in the drawing with the cursor doesn&#39;t change the rise and/or run, while it should change if the function was working.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The parameter &#39;Height&#39; is vague. The button allows the user to set a reference point, and a vertical height for the roof starting from from that reference point.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Define rise/run in drawing&#39; would be more accurate than &#39;Height&#39;.<br/>
(In Dutch: &quot;Helling door muisklik&quot; would be quite clear, I think)<br/>
In the &quot;Create Roof Face&quot; dialog this function is called &quot;2nd Click Height&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
It feels like the tolerance/forgiveness of the cursor position may need some tuning. One would expect that as long as the cursor is in a particular quadrant, the 1:1-constrained window will be inserted in that quadrant, however this is not occurring.<br/>
<br/>
To see how one would expect the shift-key constraint to behave/feel, simply switch to a top/plan view and draw a rectangle which holding the shift key. The quadrant predictability and &quot;feel&quot; of the drawing action should be as smooth as that.<br/>
<br/>
I have not attached a Vectorworks file because the issue can be reproduced in any new, blank file.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in 2022<br/>
-Double-click the Wall to activate the Reshape tool<br/>
-Drag the Window while holding-down the SHIFT key to constrain the movement<br/>
<br/>
Note that the movement gets constrained, so the Window can easily be moved upward on the Z-axis or sideways on the X-axis.<br/>
<br/>
-Now open the file in 2023<br/>
-With the Selection tool, drag the Window while holding-down the SHIFT key<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the movement can sometimes be constrained horizontally on the X-axis (though it&#39;s not as consistent), and it can&#39;t be constrained at all on the Z-axis.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to move the Window with the Reshape tool (or with the new Edit Wall tool) has been removed in 2023, so from what I can tell there&#39;s no way to constrain vertical movement in 2023.<br/>

                Slab drainage - Drains will not move when another object is present

<br/>
I have a slab with drainage and drains.<br/>
<br/>
I want to move the drains to a new location. <br/>
<br/>
Oddly, and this is a long standing bug, the drains will not move if another object is present at the new location. Nor will a drain be created where there is another object.<br/>
<br/>
In the test file, right click on the slab and choose edit drainage.<br/>
<br/>
Choose first mode - &quot;Edit Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
now select the drain and move it to the center of the CB. The drain will not move.<br/>
<br/>
Now move the drain to a location away from the CB. The drain should move.<br/>
<br/>
Even with snapping suspended the drain will not move where there is another object.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be something that is messing up the drainage when another object is in the vicinity of where you&#39;d like to move a drain or create a drain.<br/>
<br/>
In the test file, right click on the slab and choose edit drainage.<br/>
<br/>
Choose Second mode - &quot;Create Drain Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to create a drain where there is another object. - It is not possible.<br/>
<br/>
If you watch the create drain preview double cross hairs you can see they disappear when an object is moused over.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When editing slab drainage to either in edit or create a drain the presence of other objects should be immaterial to the success of moving or creating drains

<br/>
How to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached Vectorworks file.<br/>
<br/>
2. All displayed objects are already selected. Left mouse click hold and drag the objects.<br/>
<br/>
Result: <br/>
- With the US Version works correctly.<br/>
- With the German Version objects behave individually, for example if we left mouse click hold and drag over a wall, it will drag that wall only and its dimensions and increase the size of the adjacent walls. All other objects remain in place.<br/>
<br/>
When switching the drawing scale, for example from 1:50 to 1:100, is as if a refresh in the drawing is done and now its recognized that all objects are selected, hence it will work correctly after that. (Its all shown in the video).<br/>
<br/>
We do not know what could be causing this specifically with the German Version. We request help to find out what can be causing this and a possible solution for this problem. Thank you in advance.

<br/>
To be more specific about the reported incompatibility: A customer recently reached out claiming that she can use the Reshape Tool to “stretch” Detail Cut Wood objects in files opened in version 2020 but not in version 2021. What she means by “stretch” is to MOVE the DCW object with other objects when selected—for example, when working on a 2D wall section and raising the plate height along with the stud wall (represented by a rectangle) two feet upward. <br/>
<br/>
I’ve experimented with this procedure described above in a blank document, and I have confirmed that one can MOVE a Detail Cut Wood object using the Reshape Tool in version 2020, but the same procedure fails in versions 2021 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
*A related bug may occur when Detail Cut Wood objects are moved using the Reshape Tool: a graphic glitch or ghost of the objects in their original position remains once the objects have been moved to a new position. This glitch may be remedied by toggling on and off the Show Sizes checkbox in the Object Info palette when the Detail Cut Wood objects are selected. To select them, however, you must drag a window large enough to capture the original and the new position of the Detail Cut Wood object.<br/>

Note the outside of the wall is rendered as green stucco (for reference). Also note the operable/venting panel is the interior-most panel, on the inner imaginary &quot;track&quot; as it were, as expected and as any real-world slider would be constructed.<br/>
<br/>
If I change the Sliding Operation (say, to OXO), as I have done in a duplicated instance of the wall and PIO, the operable panel shifts to the outermost &quot;track&quot;. This is both an incorrect representation of real-world exterior sliding doors, and a &quot;flip&quot; spontaneously executed by Vectorworks but not by the user. The operable leaf should stay on the inside &quot;track&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have observed this behavior in 2022 and 2023.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the settings dialog and go to the 3D Visualization pane<br/>
-Change the Open Angle and press the TAB key<br/>
<br/>
Note that the preview window doesn&#39;t update.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this happens because there&#39;s only one entry field in the 3D Visualization pane, so there&#39;s no way to apply the Open Angle change unless you change some other setting in that pane or switch the focus to an entry field on another pane.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, the &quot;Size&quot; field in the Centerline Marker pane will update the preview even though TAB doesn&#39;t actually move the cursor to another field. Ideally the Open Angle field would behave the same way.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 10, you can get the preview to update if you press the TAB key about 15 times. Also on Windows, the Centerline Marker pane shows the same problem as the 3D Visualization pane (whereas the Centerline Marker pane works fine on Mac).

In the *Door Settings* dialog box (*Configuración de puerta*), you&#39;ll see that the names for the following tabs are truncated in Spanish:<br/>
 * {{Configuración: Puerta corredera rústica}}<br/>
 * {{Configuración: Puerta corrediza con cámara}}<br/>

Mouse hovering does not help since there are no hovering tips for such UI elements (unless I&#39;m wrong.)<br/>

*Impact:* localization (language) and UX (user experience) for our Spanish-speaking users.<br/>
<br/>
*Recommendations:* widen the window about 40-50% for the tab names in the Configuración de puerta dialog box. See screenshots for visual context.<br/>

If we &quot;edit style&quot; of a window (OIP) , but make no changes and exit with &quot;OK&quot;, this triggers the text style change desired, but only for that window style. We have to repeat for each window style to get the text to change.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the Window tool using the custom style and place an object<br/>
-Change the Width/Height of the object<br/>
-Now edit the style<br/>
-Change the Width/Height and set them to be by-style<br/>
-Now place another Window using the same style<br/>
<br/>
Note that it gets created with the wrong height/width. If you edit the style again and click OK the problem will correct itself.<br/>
<br/>
If you re-select the Window Style before placing the last instance, the problem won&#39;t occur, so it seems like the tool is storing old info from before the style was edited.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing can be seen with Windows and Doors. If I try with other plugins like Base Cabinets, I see the problem in the interactive insertion preview graphics but not in the object itself.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022.

<br/>
To reproduce, open in VW 2021 and 2022.<br/>

Note that the transom shows the glass texture in 2021, but in 2022 it incorrectly shows the texture assigned to the &quot;Finish-Paint-White&quot; class (see attached screenshots).<br/>
<br/>
If you increase the Spring value to 3&quot;, the texture then shows correctly.<br/>

<br/>
Note that, even though the Door contains a &quot;sash&quot; from the sidelights and transom (shown in red), the dimension only includes the leaf geometry (shown in blue).<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, with Window objects, the auto-dim option is also named &quot;Leaf/Sash&quot; even though Windows don&#39;t have a &quot;leaf&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Since the Dimension menus in the Define Legend Image dialog have the ability to differentiate between Windows and Doors, it would make sense to rename these dim options to &quot;Sash&quot; (when Windows are the defined object type) and &quot;Leaf&quot; (when Doors are the defined object type).

If I go back to 2023 SP0, the same problem happens with one of the Door objects while most of the Window objects show fine.<br/>

I don&#39;t see this problem with regular Viewports or Section Viewports so it looks like a GL issue.

The error message at the bottom of the window is displayed after I edited a cell in the worksheet. <br/>
But the message is completely wrong. <br/>
The PIO whose value I tried to edit is even unstyled. <br/>
The actual reason for getting the error was that I returned false in the PIO&#39;s &quot;AllowWorksheetEdit&quot; function.<br/>
The error message should therefore be like &quot;This value could not be changed as the object did not accept any changes for this parameter.&quot;. <br/>
The current incorrect text needs to be replaced by a non-misleading one.<br/>
Optimal behaviour would be if the PIO could return a specific error message in &quot;AllowWorksheetEdit&quot; and VW would display that.

When running the Wall Framing, we’re getting varying results, but it’s not usually able to frame the New 2x4 Class by itself.  Would we need to run all of the Wall Classes at once in order for this to work?  (I’ve included a screenshot of what happens when running Wall Framing with all of those classes on with 2x4 members.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I’m incredibly sorry if all of this is Working as Designed, but I would like to share it here in case you may have any suggestions to improve Wall Framing in more complex environments like this. <br/>

<br/>
When in Edit Mode of an Extrude that was created with the Mirror Tool Duplicate, its not displayed that same Extrude and another Extrude created with the Move Tool Duplicate.<br/>
<br/>
How to reproduce the problem.<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached Vectorworks file.<br/>
<br/>
In the Vectorworks file we have 3 Cubes.<br/>
<br/>
Cube 1: Created with the Rectangle Tool plus cmd+E for Extrude.<br/>
<br/>
Cube 2: Created with the Move and Duplicate Mode from the Cube 1.<br/>
<br/>
Cube 3: Created with the Mirror Duplicate Mode from the Cube 2.<br/>
<br/>
2. When double-clicking Cube 1 and enter Edit Mode. We can correctly see all 3 Extrudes.<br/>
<br/>
3. When in Edit Mode with Cube 2 we can also correctly see all 3 Extrudes.<br/>
<br/>
4. When in Edit Mode with Cube 3, we can only see Cube 1.<br/>
<br/>
Same problem happens with VW2021 SP5.

The expected behaviour would be that control handles would only appear *on* this (straight) object and that any control handles that did appear would make sense in terms of their location and behaviour if the object was reshaped.

Vectorworks 2022: the space will seem placed correctly at first sight, but when you zoom on objects, you well see that the center of the space is located a few lightyears away<br/>
Vectorworks 2023: The resulting space will be displaced a few meters form the intended location<br/>

All these issues are non- existent when you delete the structural member which is surrounding the building.

It shows the first available option &quot;Plane&quot;. This is not true, but this does not matter - if I change the map type rendering does not change.<br/>
<br/>
This happens because StructMemb3D::SetComponentAttributes() always sets the type to kParamSpaceKind_SurfaceUV for internal geometry and ignores the selected type.<br/>
<br/>
I believe there is a reason for this behavior, but this is misleading and maybe we should restrict the ability to change the map type for Structural members. OIP has generic code and I try to avoid adding special cases, so possible solution can be that Initialization and Reset should rewrite it back to Surface UV.

Note that the column-type member shows the profile shape as expected, but the linear and poly-type members show the overall shapes of the SMs.<br/>

Since any member type can be used with any style, it doesn&#39;t really make sense to show the overall shape in the thumbnail. Ideally it would always show the profile shape like it does with column-type members.

This presents an unworkable workflow for production riggers and electricians working on drawings before the final engineering stage whereafter trim heights will no longer be changed.

Whenever the =&#39;CableObject&#39;.&#39;UsedParts&#39; is invoked, it should automatically collect the needed information.<br/>
<br/>
In the screenshot attached, I ran the Create Cable Report command upon a single cable which resulted in showing three cables making up the cable run. I then refreshed my own worksheet and it properly displayed those three cables.<br/>
<br/>
refreshing my column requires a multistep process each time a cable is added to a drawing. Rerunning the Create Cable Report and then refreshing the user created worksheets.

if sorted by &#39;power port&#39; inputs and outputs from the various distributors get split up in the list, which should not ever be possible<br/>

<br/>
if sorted by name again the same issue as by default<br/>

If the view is sorted using both the filter box and a sort by column the power port column still doesn&#39;t display in a logical fashion, the input is placed in the middle of the list rather than either the top or bottom<br/>
<br/>
It has to either be possible to set multiple column sort orders, similar to how worksheets handle this issue, <br/>
or the sort order for the power port column has to be fixed in the same order as the inputs and outputs are displayed in the distributors object properties, without the ability to separate/split the power ports, so that they can&#39;t be sorted into a list where they mixed up  with the power ports of other distributors.<br/>

<br/>
I have attached two files. One from SP1 and another from SP3.<br/>
In SP1, the chosen cable I wished to place was placed as expected. In SP3, the cable read the output connector of my first clicked upon distributor and ignored my chosen cable. Edison jumper cables were placed rather than the Multi cables I had selected.<br/>
<br/>
In SP1<br/>
 * Choose the cable insertion tool.<br/>
 * Select a Socapex Multi Cable<br/>
 * Select the single connection mode<br/>
 * Click on the Distro.<br/>
 * In the popup, check the always use next free output box.<br/>
 * Select Out.A.120 to choose the first multi-output and click OK<br/>
 * Connect to Breakout #1<br/>
 ## This inserts a multi-cable as expected.<br/>
 * Click on the DIstro again<br/>
 * Click on Breakout #2<br/>
 * Repeat again by clicking on the distro and then breakout #3<br/>
 * All three cables match the selected multi-cable.<br/>
 * No, the patch didn&#39;t work as desired. That&#39;s a different issue.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Repeating the above steps in SP3 results in the user&#39;s choice of cable being changed by the Distro output to which it is being selected.<br/>
In SP3...<br/>
 # Choose the cable insertion tool.<br/>
 # Select a Socapex Multi Cable<br/>
 # Select the single connection mode<br/>
 # Click on the Distro.<br/>
 # In the popup, check the always use next free output box.<br/>
 # Select Out.A.120 to choose the first multi-output and click OK<br/>
 # Connect to Breakout #1<br/>
 ## This inserts a multi-cable as expected.<br/>
 # Click on the DIstro again<br/>
 # Click on Breakout #2<br/>
 ## This inserts an Edison Jumper instead of the expected multi-cable<br/>
 # Repeat again by clicking on the distro and then breakout #3<br/>
 # Open the power planning web palette and note the connections. Breakout #1 is connected as expected. #2 &amp; #3 are both connected to Edisons on the Distro and Multi on the breakouts.<br/>
<br/>
As discussed in our spotlight meeting, this behavior is due to the three different connectors in the distro and the cable reading the &quot;next&quot; open connector. This will be added as a new VE.

in this video and File, it shows a cable, that is inserted in the wrong class.<br/>
The Style itself shows another class; new cables are inserted correctly.<br/>

Do you know this issue and maybe know where it comes from (so how to avoid it)?<br/>

I checked the file a bit and it has something to do with the lighting devices the user uses.<br/>

I enclose a file and a movie explaining this. As you can see, only one layer is visible and if a Braceworks calculation is done either by &#39;selection or visible only&#39; it will list *all *the hoists in the file. This is in the &#39;Hoist Workload&#39; column. This is highly confusing for users.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the value of KN is listed as &#39;0&#39; they are all in red understandably. The bug is that those hoists not taking part in a calculation should *not *be listed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
To test this, open to blank documents.<br/>
<br/>
In document A, use the resource selector tool to select a power source and a distributor and then connect them with the cable.<br/>
<br/>
In document B, select the same power source and distributor, but use only the resource manager to make your selections. After inserting both devices, connect them with the cable.<br/>
<br/>
Compare your results in the component graph inside both documents.<br/>

{code:java}<br/>
When a user is importing truss symbols in an existing file, truss objects do not correctly refresh to reflect the new symbol definition. This affects both the truss objects displayed properties in the OIP and attached records.<br/>
 The truss symbol definition in the file resources will correctly display the changes but all existing truss objects in the file will not have their OIP properties updated to reflect the changes, both in the shape pane and in the data pane.{code}<br/>
Any new truss objects drawn using the newly imported symbol definition will display any changes to the truss record (and any new custom records) in the data tab correctly but the shape pane will still not display the updated properties.<br/>
 In both cases selecting the truss object and using the customize truss symbol data command shows that the truss properties have been correctly updated with any changes from the imported symbol definition<br/>
<br/>
Additionally the Braceworks load overview dialogue will not display the changes to the truss properties.<br/>

For testing and comparisons, I have added focus points and truss symbols. We are inconsistent with our nomenclature and how the fields are reporting their changes.<br/>
<br/>
ID Fields:<br/>
<br/>
For a truss, the ID field is not copied at all.<br/>
For a distributor object, the ID field duplicates and increments as expected. However, the label showing this information does not update in the drawing until another change is made to the distributor object in the info palette.<br/>

Users who build events based on prior events will often use a favorite file from which they copy pre-built systems into new drawings. All the info needs to remain intact when copying and pasting. Unless conflicts occur. Then a conflict occurs, normal VW practice of adding a -1 to the duplicated item should be followed.

I am seeing this going all the way back to VW24, so this might look like WAD.  However, in this example workflow, there is no easy way to know the trim height of the Hanging Position.<br/>
<br/>
Added observation that can be seen in the video:<br/>
 * Lighting Devices placed on this Hanging Position have a Z value that reflect the true trim height, even when placed before the Change Trim Height of System.<br/>
 * The new 2023 Truss Tag-Hanging Position Info has a Bottom Trim value which shows the Hanging Position&#39;s Z value and not the trim value.

For electricians, these terms represent the source as to where the power is coming from and target to be down the line of distribution ending at the consumer.<br/>
<br/>
Generator to Distributor to Breakout to Consumer.<br/>
<br/>
When choosing a breakout distributor and patching its input back to a distributor output, Auto Numbering is reversing the source and target. Thus, the intended labels are being placed in the wrong places.<br/>
<br/>
This also leads to incorrect information being inserted into the OIP of the cables themselves. A screenshot shows two cables that should have information that differs only by a single number. The result fields differ completely.<br/>
<br/>
Worksheets reflect the same confusion with differing information in unexpected fields.<br/>

<br/>
Please excuse the nature of this report as it is not meant to be aggressive whatsoever and is probably partly to do to my ignorance. However some of these occurrences don&#39;t seem correct hence this VB.<br/>
<br/>
In the enclosed file and movie you will see 3 identical rows of truss all supported each by 3 motors. Underneath spanning all 3 rows and connected to all are some lighting pipes.<br/>
<br/>
If you select one bit of truss and in the OIP &#39;Change Trim Height of System...&#39; and choose &#39;Entire System&#39; everything is highlighted so the program can see that it is all connected. <br/>
 * Is it a bug that when a Braceworks calculation is performed there is only one red influence line (Mby) drawn on one truss and not the other two? When one disconnected motor is attached to the truss the Braceworks calculation is completely different (ie correct).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Is it a bug that when a &#39;System Check all Objects&#39; is done the one motor that is not connected to anything does not have a warning label and the Calculation Overview has a green light?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Is it a bug that when the Clear Calculation Results is run the motor&#39;s chain disappears and can only come back if re-generated via checking the simplified chain option?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Is it a bug that when in the OIP you click Select System Objects only each run is highlighted not the entire connected system?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Is it a bug that when each lighting pipe is selected and in the OIP the Select Truss System is clicked only the pipe and truss crosses are selected and not the entore connected system?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 * Is it a bug that that the truss crosses don&#39;t appear to determine whether the Change Trim Height of System recognises that the entire system is connected together or not? Also when doing a Braceworks Calculation? (If not what is their purpose regarding pipes and trusses?).<br/>
<br/>
The was originally a 2022 one but has been converted.<br/>

<br/>
We have a rigging user who complained that it was impossible to have just one point load hanging off one motor. He says he does it all the time for speakers, set elements and other technical things. I reminded him that the only way to do it was to have 2 x motors and a rigging object. Obviously this is not how it is rigged in real life for him so that workaround is no good.<br/>
<br/>
I then created a custom piece of truss which was a Sphere from the 3D toolset, This allows one motor and a point load to be connected. The point load could then be replaced by a symbol in the OIP and it this worked it would be a far more real life workaround for him.<br/>
<br/>
Everything works perfectly. As you can see from the video the systems appear correct and when the entire system&#39;s trim is changed in the OIP everything is connected and moves together accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this report it to observe that when a Braceworks calculation is done an error comes up saying that the point load is not properly supported and so nothing else can be calculated.<br/>
<br/>
Why if all is recognised as being the entire system does this error occur and thus I say it is a bug. If this could be fixed then this at least could be a workaround for hanging a load off one motor.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
for consistency&#39;s sake, the cable reshape tool should use the same acquisition hint indicators. It is confusing when the indicator matches the Move setting instead of the add/subtract choice.<br/>

in the file is a simple static calculation. As soon as I select the option &quot; Compensate drops&quot; the error message &quot; BRXFemHandel not set &quot; appears.<br/>

Unfortunately I have not found anything in the documentation. Can you tell me if this is WAD and I have overlooked something ?<br/>

What does the option &quot; Compensate drops &quot; do in the background ?<br/>

<br/>
If you connect a fixture twice with a cable, there is no message that it is already connected. If you now delete a connection - and this was the first one - the headlight is optically connected but not in the palette. This gives the user the feeling that the headlight is connected, but it is not.<br/>

I have attached a video and a file.<br/>

If the tool is activated and set to insert a drop the upper truss will highlight but not the lower truss.

The first click should attach the hinge to the truss, then the second click should specify the angle.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When converting the 2-D/3-D symbol &quot;Truss Prolyte H30D-300-down&quot;  in class &quot;BR-Prolyte-H30D&quot; to a Truss, it takes a very long time. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as you remove the Truss from the chain hoist, the process works as usual medium fast.<br/>
It looks like the connection between the hoist and the Truss is slowing down the conversion process.<br/>
<br/>
To do this, select the symbol &quot;Truss Prolyte H30D-300-down&quot;  and convert it to a Truss. You can watch how piece by piece is converted.<br/>
<br/>
If you undo this process, remove all chain hoists and repeat it, the speed will be as usual.<br/>

 # In a New document, Edit Design Layer-1 Elevation (video shows 200&#39;)<br/>
 # Activate Truss Tool _(*Must use Distributed Insertion*)_<br/>
 # Go to 3D View _(Issue also found in Top/Plan - just easier to see both issues in Isometric view)_<br/>
 # Draw length of truss<br/>
 # *Issue 1* Note the {color:#FF0000}Red{color} Highlight line shown at documents Z: 0&#39;, but when completed, the truss symbols are drawn at Design Layer-1 Z: 0&#39; _(Elevation 200&#39;)_<br/>
 # Next draw a connected length of truss to existing truss<br/>
 # *Issue 2* Note the {color:#FF0000}Red{color} Highlight line shown connecting to the existing truss, but when completed the truss symbols are 200&#39; above the exiting truss<br/>
<br/>
These two issue don&#39;t appear if Single Insertion mode is used for the Truss Tool.  <br/>
<br/>
This might be related to the fix made for VB-185242.  This was found when testing to verify.  That issue looks to be fixed, but these new issues were not present when looking back at SP3 builds.  I tested Vectorworks 2022 SP3 Build 646432, this did not have the issue being reported and still had the issue for VB-185242.

In the attached file and movie you can see some LED Screens made by the LED tool and a Hanging Position (HP) above.<br/>
When the LED objects are all selected the contextual menu item &quot;Attach to Rigging Object&quot; is available. When the HP highlights in red you click but note the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. One LED remains on the ground.<br/>
2. The others attach via their 0 value and at the height of the truss so they draw above the truss.<br/>
3. Some change in the Left/Right dimension and there are overlaps and gaps whereas they should all be butting up against each other.<br/>
<br/>
In the 2nd movie you can see that even when doing it one by one the command does not work correctly. Only by dragging them onto the HP does it work.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

 # VB-188814<br/>
 # VB-188816<br/>
<br/>
it is essential that we have the capability to allow users to specify the lengths of their breakout tails. In the attached screenshot, I show several versions of break outs with both staggered and constant breakout lengths. In the 2021 version of the current cable tools, the OIP had user specifiable length fields.<br/>
<br/>
users here in the US will often specify a staggered breakout instead of jumper cables. If they have a 60 foot staggered breakout, that gives them a connection point at every 10 feet for six circuits. With a twofer at each connection point, that handles 12 lights on a truss with a single multicable and attached breakout. Thus, avoiding the weight and labor needed for those six jumpers. Multiply this by five truss runs, a production removes 30 jumper cables.<br/>
<br/>
During the meeting sometime back when the above bug reports were submitted, [~mstaffel] indicated these fields would return.<br/>
<br/>
As these fields were present in 2021, I&#39;ve marked this as a regression.

<br/>
In the attached video and snapshot, it can seen that the cross ends of truss symbols are visible when all Truss Classes are turned off.  These cross ends do not exist in the Truss Symbol 3D Component, but it seems to be assigned to the None Class.<br/>
<br/>
These cross ends are also rendering outside of Wireframe in the modes listed below and demonstrated in the attached PDFs.  To my understanding, these should behave similar to the Insert Points, and even when visible do not render outside of Wireframe. <br/>
<br/>
Since to me it is unclear if just the Class needs to change or something additional has to be done to correct the rendering issue, I put these issues in one VB.  I can easily change that or file an additional VB if this requires separate fixes or engineers.<br/>

Use something like &quot;Spot #^0&quot; and replace &quot;^0&quot; with the number.

<br/>
BIM becomes more and more an important part in architecture in Germany.<br/>
Also we at Computerworks start to increase to advertise BIM.<br/>
Customers start to use bimobject more and more.<br/>
Two well known manufacturer are for example Velux for roof windows and Kaldewei for washbasins.<br/>
The roof windows of Velux seem to be imported as a vertex only. Customer do expect a 3D-object of the downloaded window.<br/>
And for example with Kaldewei Classic ø420 the customer gets a completely different 3D-object.<br/>
The are only two examples. We do think, if customers could download 3D-object by BIMobject, the objects should meet their data and customer should get the appropriate 3D-object.

In need of assistance with a 2019 Fundamentals customer considering an upgrade to a license or two of Architect.From our customer:<br/>
_“The issue I am having is that when I send a model from VW 2022 to C4D R26, most smart objects, specifically Walls (also pillars fasteners, ramps and more), do not get transferred when I use the “sort by class” option. All of the other options of “sort by” bring all of the elements. I have attached screenshots to illustrate._<br/>
_The workflow we have developed over the last decade of using the software relies on the sort by class option. Can this be fixed or would a previous version of VW work as expected?_<br/>
_Thanks in advance for your help.”_Curious if this has something to do with the difference of FUND vs. ARCH, something with the new release of C4D this month, both or something entirely different.  Thank you for any help in advance.<br/>

Unable to use Decals as Attribute Mapping tool doesn&#39;t seem to work also underlying texture sometimes &quot;disappears&quot; when going back to the selection tool.<br/>

In the enclosed file and movie you will see that the Sweep has a decal applied. The mapping is set to Plane.<br/>
Select the Sweep. If the Attribute Mapping tool (AMT) is then clicked on the Sweep is de-selected. If you then click on the Sweep with the AMT, then you get an error message saying that the object is not applicable.<br/>

143008 Flag, USA is one example (the first color gobo I found).<br/>

In theory, there can be a script that checked all the gobo textures in the content library, and copies the transparency image to the color image if none exists.

    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Developers are seeing this when launching from Xcode.  Not seeing this when launching autobuilds when double-clicking.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Those reporting it include Josh, Hernan, Rick, and Ian.  Previous reports from a couple months ago were from Lada and Miriam, before R26 upgrade and code changes.  Josh reports this problem started for him with R26 merge.  Josh also reports that the C4D app in the Cineware folder launches OK if he double-clicks on it, and autobuild launches fine.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I suggested upgrading to Xcode 13 but that didn&#39;t fix this for Josh.  Selin is not seeing this with macOS 11.6 and Xcode 13.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some ideas are that this is very slow security checking like we see with our own plugins on launch.  It also might be a dependency on protection/activation events and timing, which might be why some are seeing it and others might not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The initial launch with Cineware app would call a function to launch and then check later if it was available.  Doing this with Cineware (DLL) now doesn&#39;t work, the code we have from Maxon is a while loop until it is fully launched.  Perhaps not looping would starve the launch thread.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Further comments after trying some things yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why Cineware is slow to launch, findings are that OnIdle is not called during this &gt;1 minute, and the wait while loop doesn&#39;t iterate more than once during this time either. Several messages are shown in the output window about Metal during this time, perhaps the OS is compiling Metal shaders for Maxon. Another likely candidate is security checking because every plugin is also slow to load, and because Cineware has many of its own files and libs involved. I disabled almost all Cineware modules in the startup config and it didn&#39;t eliminate any of the pause I am seeing. I am on Xcode 12.5.1 and macOS 11.6.1, Intel.

Happens when I quit Vectorworks. If I continue past the assert, I get an exception. Although the exception call stack looks like it has something to do with maxon, Dave Donley removed maxon from his build and it still happened.<br/>
<br/>
To repro just bring up Vectorworks, new blank document, and quit. Doesn&#39;t matter whether home page comes up initially or whether default is set to not show home page and prefs set to open new blank document. Doesn&#39;t matter whether quit is using X on top right or File&gt;Quit.<br/>
<br/>
I tried deleting User folder, removing Output folder from workspace, deleting it, and sync&#39;ing. It still happened.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac when I quit I get the &quot;An extension file has not been released&quot; assert, but I&#39;m not seeing that on Win. Don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with what&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
This bug probably needs to get sent to Vlado, or whoever deals with plugin interface.

                RW Camera: &quot;Match Current View&quot; should change Camera Height, not Z value

<br/>
Currently, the &quot;Camera Height&quot; field stays constant and the change in view is instead reflected in the &quot;Z&quot; height. This is not useful and is the opposite of expected behavior (from a user&#39;s perspective that is, though perhaps it&#39;s currently &quot;WAD&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
As an example scenario, I&#39;ll often be flying through a 3D model of a film set with my SpaceMouse while a Director watches over my shoulder. They&#39;ll commonly ask &quot;what&#39;s our camera height right now&quot; - so I insert a camera and Match Current View. But then I have to do math because instead of just telling me the Camera Height, Vectorworks includes a Z offset instead.<br/>
<br/>
For context, the Z height field for Cameras is useful for when you&#39;re on a raised platform of some sort. You manually set the Z height to match that surface, so it becomes a sort of datum level. After that, everything should be IN RELATION to that Z datum you&#39;ve set, meaning as you change the view the &quot;Camera Height&quot; should be changing, not my &quot;Z&quot; height.

<br/>
steps to reproduce.<br/>
 1)Open the attached file. (12959.vwx)<br/>
 2)There is a Site model and select it.<br/>
 Then click &quot;Edit Existing Surface&quot; or &quot;Edit Proposed Surface&quot; on OIP.<br/>
 3)Select &quot;Sculptor&quot; from Surface Sculpting tool set.<br/>
 4)Click anywhere of the object and sculpt.<br/>
 5)Select the Undo command or press Ctrl + Z key for undoing the operation before, that is undone but you get exited from the Surface Sculpting mode.<br/>
<br/>
We feel the undo command should just undo the action or the change by tools, exiting from a mode makes users take extra time and effort.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to attached files and a movie. (12959.vwx and 12959.mp4)<br/>

<br/>
-create a sphere<br/>
-convert to mesh<br/>
-look at crease angle field on Render tab of OIP for the mesh<br/>
notice it says 50 but actually it should say &quot;—&quot;  or &quot;n/a&quot; or &quot;0&quot; because mesh smoothing is disabled in vectorworks prefs.  This is confusing to user.<br/>
<br/>
-change the Mesh Smoothing dropdown to None<br/>
notice the crease angle still says 50 when it should now say &quot;—&quot; or &quot;0&quot;.  Basically the crease angle field doesn&#39;t update when the Mesh Smoothing field changes.<br/>
<br/>
I shelved a small CL 632568 to address this bug but it seems like setting the crease angle field on OIP doesn&#39;t work when Mesh Smoothing field is changed.  Need shell help.

If you set a SMarkerStyle in the Control, then set it by Class and remove the set by Class again. Under Windows the Selected SMarkerStyle is now the default SMarkerStyle. In MacOS it switches back to the first selected SMarkerStyle.<br/>
<br/>
Code to reproduce the Bug:<br/>
Set a SMarkerStyle in the VWMarkerPopupCtrl that differ from the default SMarkerStyle.<br/>
<br/>
Call following functions:<br/>
gSDK-&gt;SelectClassChoice(dialogID, componentID, true);<br/>
gSDK-&gt;SelectClassChoice(dialogID, componentID, false);<br/>
<br/>
Under MacOs the SMarkerStyle that was set before these 2 Method is set again in the VWMarkerPopupCtrl<br/>
Under Windows it is set to the default value.<br/>

                Landscape area texture is mapped strangely on the sides of circular/oval segments

<br/>
The texture mapping on the sides of the holes is strange. It seems to be dependent on the curvature of the shape. For the circle it is the same everywhere, whereas for the oval and the rounded rectangle it is more dense in places where the curve turns faster. What is interesting is that it is relatively the same for the polyline at all points.

- If you go to the IOP and ask to Replace the style : same result.<br/>

<br/>
When you choose a Hardscape style from our libraries &quot;Techno-Bloc (TEC)&quot;, there is a 3D overview which implies that there is a Renderworks texture associated to it.<br/>
<br/>
When selected, the Renderworks texture is well imported but there is no display of it on the object.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I click&amp;drop the style directly from the Ressources manager to the object, the texture won&#39;t appear.<br/>

                Mac - Vectorworks is inconsistent in showing dialogs on multiple monitors
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is not a new issue and is mainly a usability annoyance.<br/>
<br/>
When you are working on a Mac with multiple monitors - such as a MacBook Pro with an external monitor - Vectorworks is not very consistent in where it shows modal dialogs. This can be a disorienting user experience.<br/>
<br/>
For example in my current setup I have Vectorworks running on the attached 4K monitor, which its also showing the Dock. When I invoke File-&gt;New (command-N), the new document modal dialog does not show up on my current active window monitor, but on the other (MBP screen) monitor. However if I choose File-&gt;Open (command-O), the open file dialog shows up on the active window screen.<br/>
<br/>
There are enough cases of this that it becomes somewhat unpredictable as to which screen will show a dialog. I think when all active Vectorworks windows are in a single monitor, that monitor should be used for all modal dialogs.

 * Please feel free to add more...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping that after these warnings are fixed, we&#39;re left with only code-related warnings from the Xcode projects, and so it may make sense to turn on the &quot;Treat Warnings As Errors&quot; setting for them.

According to this [BuildingSmart resource|http://docs.buildingsmartalliance.org/MVD_WSIE/schema/ifcmeasureresource/content.htm], there are various luminous entities, but none of them is called &quot;Luminosity&quot;.

In the enclosed movie you can see a DTM created from the source data that I also enclose. Note that it is millimetres.<br/>

If you change the major and minor contours they do not generate correctly only ever the default setting. In order for them to show correctly you have to modify the source data.<br/>

<br/>
Right now, you can&#39;t add a solid color to a hardscape (or Landscape area). I don&#39;t have access to the &#39;None&#39; setting until I ungroup the object.<br/>
<br/>
If I remove the texture from the Material in the component, I get a white component but can&#39;t apply a solid color, and the Texture dropdown is still not available.<br/>
<br/>
The other way to get access to the Texture dropdown is to set the whole object to mode: By Object. However, even when I can access the setting, it doesn&#39;t let the color attribute to be applied to the 3D object.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not possible to add color via the class either.

to &#39;No Site Modifier&#39;:<br/>
 !image-2022-12-19-20-01-27-126.png|thumbnail! <br/>
Note that the elevation changes.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
<br/>
When changing the configuration from &#39;Planar Pad&#39;, &#39;Aligned&#39; or &#39;Path&#39; to &#39;No Site Modifier&#39; the elevation of the geometry changes. Note that the *Hardscape in &#39;No Site Modifier&#39; configuration is always flat and horizontal* at the elevation set by the &#39;Elevation&#39; parameter of the Hardscape object.<br/>
<br/>
The geometry of &#39;Planar Pad&#39;, &#39;Aligned&#39; or &#39;Path&#39; configuration is *entirely defined by the used modifier*.<br/>
Note that only &#39;Planar Pad&#39; has flat geometry but could be sloped (non-horizontal), while the &#39;Aligned&#39; and &#39;Path&#39; in general have arbitrary non-flat geometry that is entirely defined by their profiles, alignments to adjacent objects, and internal surface modifiers.<br/>
Only the &#39;Planar Pad&#39; and &#39;Aligned&#39; have &#39;Elevation&#39; parameter while the &#39;Path&#39; has &#39;Start Elevation&#39; and &#39;End Elevation&#39; parameters.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when changing the configuration to &#39;No Site Modifier&#39;, the geometry could only be preserved if the geometry of the modifier we are starting from is flat and horizontal!<br/>
However, *such a change is necessary to synchronize the elevations*.<br/>
<br/>
*I&#39;m thinking of the following synchronization:*<br/>
<br/>
If changed from &#39;Planar Pad&#39; or &#39;Aligned&#39; to &#39;No Site Modifier&#39;, the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the modifier is transferred to be the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the Hardscape object.<br/>
And vice versa - if changed from &#39;No Site Modifier&#39; to &#39;Planar Pad&#39; or &#39;Aligned&#39;, the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the Hardscape object is transferred to be the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the modifier.<br/>
<br/>
If changed from &#39;Path&#39; to &#39;No Site Modifier&#39;, the &#39;Start Elevation&#39; of the Path modifier is taken from the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the Hardscape object.<br/>
Vice versa: If changed from &#39;No Site Modifier&#39; to &#39;Path&#39;, then the &#39;Start Elevation&#39; of the Path modifier should be taken from the &#39;Elevation&#39; of the Hardscape object, and the &#39;End Elevation&#39; = &#39;End Elevation&#39; - &#39;Start Elevation&#39; + &#39;Elevation&#39; of Hardscape object.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Draw a Planar Pad modifier and set its Elevation to 5&#39;0&quot; or so<br/>
-Export the file to VW 2022 format and open it in VW 2022<br/>
-Run the &quot;Reset All Plugins&quot; command, then update the Site Model<br/>
<br/>
Note that everything appears fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now save the file in 2022, then open it in VW 2023<br/>
<br/>
Note that the Pad&#39;s elevation changes to 0&quot; during translation.<br/>
<br/>
If I try this with an object created in VW 2022 I don&#39;t see the problem, so it looks like reverse-translating then forward-translating is causing problems.

<br/>
Customer insists this is a bug and would like it to keep the same pixel per inch size as the other export options do. He says that exporting the page with the &quot;All visible objects&quot; selection gives him an accurate page width and height but if he selects the page with the marquee tool, it gives him what seems like a randomly smaller size.

<br/>
1. Update the viewport and note that much of the geometry disappears, in particular anything that is a polyline. Also note the two symbols that were on the right now do not display at all. No amount of editing of these symbols will make them appear in the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
2. Uncheck Display 2D Fills in the OIP for the section viewport then update it again. Now the line work reappears in the two left symbols, but without the fills the symbols are not displaying hidden line correctly. The two symbols on the right still fail to appear at all.<br/>
<br/>
This company has 18 Architect seats on VSS and is just switching from Vw 2020 to Vw 2022. They are a very important customer for us so we really need to find a solution to this issue as they have hundreds of the symbols that have been developed over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the issue us related to the removal of screen plane objects and all these symbol components were drawn with screen plane geometry. I tried switching all symbol geometry to layer plane, but that didn&#39;t really achieve a positive result (script below).<br/>

Please let me know if you need any further information.<br/>

Steps I took to make it look correct (however, those are not suitable for complex plug-in geometry creation.)<br/>
 - Correct if using mapping type &quot;Auto-align plane&quot; + manual rotation.<br/>
 - Correct if using the texture tool to add/edit surface textures.<br/>
 - Correct if using mapping type &quot;Sphere&quot; + manual insertion/scale/rotation.<br/>
<br/>
-For comparison, Multiple extrude geometry looks correct.- (Edit: it does not. Apparently the multiple extrude I was testing with has customized texture mapping applied to make it look correct. After testing with with clean &quot;multiple extrude&quot; I see it looks the same as &quot;tapered extrude&quot;, with misaligned textures.)

                Railing/Fence - Posts rendered as square instead of round after Undo+Redo
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      # Create a blank document<br/>
 # Create a Railing/Fence object with round posts<br/>
Note: Make sure the object has a fairly long path. I&#39;ve noticed this issue doesn&#39;t happen with short paths. I was able to consistently reproduce this using a 20m line for the path.<br/>
 # Switch to a 3D view and zoom in, so that you can clearly see the shape of the posts<br/>
 # Tools-&gt;Utilities-&gt;Reset All Plug-Ins<br/>
Note: Obviously, the geometry doesn&#39;t change<br/>
 # Hit Undo and, immediately after that, Redo<br/>
<br/>
After these actions, the posts appear as if they have a square profile, instead of a round one. Sometimes it does not happen until after a few &quot;Undo+Redo&quot;s, but in my testing it always happened when using a 20m long path.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think this is related to the PIO itself, but rather with the VW rendering system. Here&#39;s my reasoning:<br/>
 * Opening up the Debug List View, you can see that the posts are actually highlighted as if they have a round profile and as if they have the handrail/guardrail subtracted from them (i.e. exactly how they were shown in the drawing before the Undo+Redo thing).<br/>
 * Saving the document as it is now and opening the saved file reveals that the posts are back to having a round profile.<br/>

In case this is important, I&#39;m on Win10 21H2, i7 10700k, GTX 1660 ti running driver version 512.15<br/>
<br/>
Definitely not a new issue, I was able to reproduce this all the way back to VW2019 (I didn&#39;t try any versions prior to that)<br/>

The above 7 steps were run again using Export/Import OBJ and the results matched that of the original vwx.  This was included in the attach video.  Wanted to include that in case that can be of some help.<br/>

Export 3DS results in the same outcome as Export glTF.  This will also be filed in a separate bug and linked in case that is helpful.<br/>

Even thought Export glTF is not found in standard Export workspace, it is now the default backing for MVR exports, which is in standard Spotlight workspaces.

11) Check &quot;Override opacity&quot; on the Fill group and enter &quot;10&quot; in the field.<br/>
<br/>
12) Check &quot;Apply attributes&quot; and close all dialogs.<br/>
<br/>
13) Check the window in the wall, it will be displayed with the opacity reflected, similar to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
* Even though you check &quot;Override opacity&quot; of the Pen and enter &quot;100&quot; in the field, but the window display will not change.<br/>
<br/>
*As long as I tried, I don&#39;t see this problem then Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>
* Also, the opacity display is different in color depth between V2022 and V2021.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to a movie and a sample file I attached.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      We will report 2 cases.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;OK&quot; button and &quot;Cancel&quot; button of the setting dialog show in the preview frame and help strings show in different position than they should be.<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Go to Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Displays and select 1440 x 900. <br/>
(1440 x 900 is just an example. The problem might reproduce if selecting other resolutions as well.)<br/>
2) Launch Vectorworks.<br/>
3) For example, place a door.<br/>
4) Click &quot;Settings&quot; on OIP.<br/>
5) Look at the bottom of the door setting dialog. The &quot;OK&quot; button and &quot;Cancel&quot; button shows in the preview frame.<br/>
6) Also, help strings don&#39;t show in the position where they should be, they show and overlap with the pane frame and the General group area.<br/>
<br/>
Please see an attached movie &quot;12853 1440x900.mov&quot; and image &quot;Comparison.png&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
B) If setting display resolution to lower and enabling the Dark appearance, the string of the &quot;Cancel&quot; button becomes invisible.<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
1) Go to Apple Menu&gt; System Preferences&gt; General and select &quot;Dark&quot; on Appearance.<br/>
2) Go back to System Preferences and go to Displays then select 1440x900. <br/>
(1440 x 900 is just an example. The problem might reproduce if selecting other resolutions as well.)<br/>
3) Launch Vectorworks.<br/>
4) For example, place doors and windows.<br/>
5) Click &quot;Settings&quot; on OIP.<br/>
6) Look at the bottom of the door setting dialog. The string of the &quot;Cancel&quot; button is invisible.<br/>
<br/>
*The string of the button becomes invisible, but the button works if you click inside the button frame.<br/>
(We confirmed that the problem occurred on 1440x900, 1280x800, 1024x640 on Mac Book Pro and confirmed on 1600x900 on iMac.)<br/>
*The problem doesn&#39;t reproduce when setting the Appearance to &quot;Light&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Please see an attached movie &quot;12853 1440x900 Dark Mode.mov&quot; and &quot;Cancel button Dark Mode.png&quot;, &quot;Cancel button Light Mode.png&quot;.<br/>

While the polyline is very smooth, you get pointy corners segmentation, unnecessary fragmentation and gaps in the resulting walls. This is odd, because manually it is perfectly possible to draw such a shape with walls, without deviating from the original form. This proves that the command &quot;create objects from shapes&quot; is not functioning optimal for this purpose.

<br/>
I&#39;ve included a screenshot of her specific setup and her math as well as a test document with a roughly similar shape where I get about the same results.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked over the math and I honestly can&#39;t say if she&#39;s right or not and would like anyone&#39;s input to determine whether or not her math/the Hunter representative&#39;s math is correct.<br/>

The user requesting more information on this is Torrey Slininger (torrey.kieseldesign@gmail.com), and I&#39;m putting their information here in case we need to reach back out to them.<br/>

<br/>
In the video capture, I&#39;m using the Existing Tree Tool in the Site Planning Tool<br/>
I&#39;m doing the following steps.<br/>
-Placing Tree in the drawing area.<br/>
-Using the 3D properties for the 3D Canopy and 3D Trunk.<br/>
-Notice when I enter incrementing values for the Multiple Stems.<br/>
-As expected the 3D trunk will change it shape and the DBH value will change also from 1&#39; to <br/>
 to something else (depending on the value that I enter).<br/>
-The issue is, when I uncheck Multiple stem (option) and enter the DBH to original value of 1&#39;.<br/>
-The Trunk doesn&#39;t revert to it&#39;s original shape.<br/>
-The more I uncheck /check the option enter the DBH default of 1&#39;. The more the trunk <br/>
 changes its shape.

In the Viewport 103 EG_Digitalisierung Bestand #7 is displayed Section-Elevation Line objects. The text of this objects has the option &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; active in the Viewport, without it will be displayed flipped. Although it is correctly displayed in the Design Layers.<br/>
<br/>
When exporting that same Viewport to PDF, the text is flipped. Why is the text being flipped in the Viewport, despite being correctly displayed in the Design Layers? Why is the PDF Export still exporting the text flipped, even with the &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; option active? With that option inactive, the result is the same.<br/>

 We have received 8 inquiries that such a phenomenon will occur.<br/>
 Also, this problem is the operation when only Vectorworks is running.<br/>
<br/>
〇This is an example of user information.<br/>
 MacStudio2022<br/>
 CPU: M1MAX<br/>
 Memory: 32GB<br/>
 OS: Monterey(12.4)<br/>
<br/>
Two monitors are connected with a mini display port-USB C conversion cable, a drawing sheet is displayed on the main display, and a tool menu is displayed on the extended side.<br/>
<br/>
・ Timing of occurrence<br/>
 The moment you select an object (text, dimension, etc.), the main display becomes unresponsive.<br/>
 The mouse cursor disappears and it does not operate.<br/>
 Vectorworks has not been freezes. The extended display can be operated.<br/>
 If you connect or disconnect the connector on the main display side, it will be displayed again and it can operate, but there will be a delay in operation. Using a Mac in safety mode reproduces the same problem.<br/>
 When this happens, an attached PDF file-like appears on the main display.<br/>
 Also, if you check the activity monitor, the CPU usage of Window Server will be significantly higher.<br/>

■ Remarks<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/97554-apple-studio-display-crashing-vw/#comment-434596]<br/>
 -I confirmed that there is a similar post in the above forum.<br/>
 -This problem occurs even when using a third-party monitor.<br/>
 -I checked the operation of a Macbook air equipped with an M1 chip in a dual monitor environment, but confirmed that it was not reproducible.<br/>
 -User said that problems will occur during work.<br/>
<br/>
-We are currently inquiring about the crash log.<br/>

The above 8 steps were run again using Export/Import OBJ and the results matched that of the original vwx.  This was included in the attach video.  Wanted to include that in case that can be of some help.<br/>

Export glTF results in the same outcome as Export 3Ds.  This will also be filed in a separate bug and linked in case that is helpful.

Is this supposed to be automatic?  I found simply dragging the TB and allowing it to snap back in place will refresh the file name field.<br/>
<br/>
Also updating plug ins also get the TB to update.<br/>
<br/>
The reason she submitted it is because this TBB is part of a template and when she firsts inserts the TBB onto a sheet it does not update with the working title of the file.

This Error does not happen with 2021, only with 2022, hence I have marked this report as a Regression.<br/>
<br/>
I could reproduce this problem only with MacOS (Monterey 12.4) and not with Windows (tested with Windows 11).<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to open the file with AutoCAD. By saving the file with AutoCAD and afterwards importing it with Vectorworks, the error does not pop-up anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If it is possible to open the file with AutoCAD and the error does not pop-up with 2021, then something is happening with 2022 that should be taken a look at.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.

<br/>
It is a known problem with the export of a .VWX drawing in which Tiles are used that the export to DWG does not always go well. This is because AutoCAD has no tiles.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that we as VW users like to use tiles. And run into problems when exporting to DWG. In this drawing rectangles have been placed in the tile, these represent the size of the prafab plates. Which must be placed exactly at this place. In the export to DWG, the complete rectangles are exported where the wall ends for instance.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good if this was addressed again. So that our customers can continue to use Tiles and the export to DWG goes well. And it has the same views as we have in the .VWX file.<br/>

<br/>
Export the file to DWG (Customer used Settings screenshot attached), when re-importing the file back to Vectorworks we can see that (screenshot attached) some objects are visible in the re-import that aren&#39;t in the original file.<br/>
<br/>
Why is this happening and should the Customer tweak the settings to solve his problem?<br/>
Is there anything we can do about the &quot;invisible classes that are also exported&quot; from the Customer message?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Original message from the Customer (translated from german):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hello!<br/>
<br/>
We have a Vectorworks file where we created layouts and generated PDF and DWG from them. PDF is no problem at all, but with DWG export, the story above it and many invisible classes are also exported.<br/>
<br/>
When I import the DWGs back into Vectorworks, the drawings show up correctly in Laoyt plane, but things show up in construction plane that aren&#39;t visible in the original file (next story to layer). Why is that? I also sent you a screenshot with these settings. We have always used these settings and it worked, but not anymore. Thanks!&quot;

<br/>
attached is a customer file.<br/>
It has a complex structure of nested viewports.<br/>
When exported to DWG some of them are missing.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a bug?<br/>
Or is the structure not appropriate for this export?<br/>

Horrible result when imported to Vectorworks.<br/>
You have to explode them in AutoCAD first.<br/>
I log it as a bug because customers do get that horrible import and do have no possibility to get a better import unless you edit the file in AutoCAD.<br/>

Customer wants to export this 3D drawing to AutoCAD as a 2D drawing and exports the sheet layer as flattened 2D graphics.<br/>
Result is that the lines in 3D plane get rotated.<br/>
Export without option Flattened 2D graphics works fine.<br/>
Export sheet layer Lay-2 with default settings and option Flattened 2d graphics.<br/>
<br/>
According to the customer this worked before Vectorworks 2021. So I tried to test this with Vectorworks 2020. But option Flattened 2D graphics is greyed in 2020 and cannot be used when exporting sheet layers. In 2022 this is possible.<br/>

Bug?<br/>
If yes, please fix it. If no, What can I tell the customer?<br/>

                Export dwg: checking and unchecking &quot;Export Complex Line Types as Blocks&quot; brings surprising results

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
The enclosed Vectorworks file is from 2022. I am unable to test in v2023 as the file fails to convert: (VB-191829 _Vectorworks 2022 unable to be converted and opened in the v2023 format_.)<br/>
<br/>
The Vectorworks file is 638 KB.  With the option &quot;Export Complex Line Types as Blocks&quot; checked which it is by default, the result is that one dwg file is created and the size is a whopping 27MB.<br/>
<br/>
If tried again but the &quot;Export Complex Line Types as Blocks&quot; is unchecked then the dwg file size is a mere 35KB!<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly two other files appear which in this case are Shape files. So the basis of this report is why do the line types blow out the dwg file size so much as I thought Vectorworks could handle and convert ACAD line types but is it not true the other way around?<br/>
Secondly, how come the Shape files are not created when this option is checked but they are created and exported when it is unchecked?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

It appears to be related or a duplicate of VB-184736 on some level?  It seems one scenario of VB-184736 was resolved in 2022 SP3, though I&#39;m still seeing the issue where if the Layer Scale doesn&#39;t match the Viewport scale, Grid Lines are duplicated when the sheet layer is exported to DXF/DWG.  I could not find an independent bug for this issue and reporting here:<br/>
<br/>
-Open attached test file (SmallerTestFile3.vwx) which I reduced from its original size<br/>
-Note the Grid Lines on the sheet layer (Before.png)<br/>
-Export to DXF/DWG using default settings<br/>
-I imported the file into a new Vectorworks document and you&#39;ll notice the duplicated Grid Lines (AfterImport.png)<br/>
<br/>
In the Export DXF/DWG dialog, checking the option, &quot;Export Viewports as 2D graphics in Model space&quot;  appears to prevent the duplicate Grid Lines and not sure if this is an option for those on the receiving end.

In Illustrator I export a DWG or DXF, then import this into Vectorworks. However the Bézier curves are importing into Vectorworks incorrectly. See &quot;BadCurves.png&quot;, in which the blue linework is the imported geometry from Illustrator, and the black linework is what it&#39;s supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
If I re-import the exported DWG directly back into illustrator it looks correct, so I don&#39;t think the issue is with the exported DWG itself (and I&#39;ve tried different combinations of export options in Illustrator). Rather, Vectorworks seems to be interpolating the bezier curves incorrectly upon import.<br/>

<br/>
A problem with the import from a georeferenced DWG, that was exporting from a sheet layer. If I activate the check-box that contains georeferenced geometry and switch to the advanced settings &gt; GIS, there I see that the file has projection information. Moreover I active the check-box to set the document&#39;s coordinate system to match with the import coordinates.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t place the import be the internal origin and replace my user origin. It calculate the the insert position from the internal origin. It feels like it ignores the georeferenced coordinates. In compare with an export from a design layer works this fine with the georeferenced import.<br/>
I attached you my test file also a screen record with my workflow.<br/>

The confusion I am having stems from when I import them by specifying the import units as inches, or mm, the objects come into VW the same size. So, it appears that there is something in the file that makes VW aware of its units. Usually when I switch the import units from Inches to mm and import the same file, the objects come in scaled by a factor of 25.4. Not so with these files.<br/>
<br/>
The DWG file was sent first, then I received a scaled down version of the data in DXF format. They both import the same way, unitless, and both generate the same size geometry in VW regardless of the DWG-VW units conversion I select. <br/>

</td>

These duplicates will be stacked on top of one another and can add significantly to the digital weight of the file and make it difficult to work with in AutoCAD.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This has been going on for many versions now. I have also tested this issue with another beta tester and the issue was reproducible. We went through every export option we could think of but were unable to eliminate the duplicates in the DWG file. This has been a HUGE problem for cross platform communication in my office. I&#39;m hopeful there is a way to tell the export process to not produce the duplicates.

Draw a row of parking with the PARKING SPACES tool. Set the parking spaces to 9&#39;x18&#39;, the 45° angle.<br/>
<br/>
The spaces are incorrect size. The 9x18 area is supposed to INCLUDE any wheel bumper. Instead VW draws 9x18 from BEYOND the bumper...in other words, a space much too long! Turning the bumper on/off has no effect on the bug.

 # Create a new Symbol Folder in the file and move all the plants into that folder.<br/>
 # Repeat steps 3 and 4 and you will now see each plant listed twice in the Update Vectoworks Plant Styles dialog. If you proceed at this point, then each plant gets added twice to the plant catalog.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those bugs that has been around for a number of versions, but it becomes very disconcerting for a diligent user who is trying to keep their files well organised through the use of a plant catalog and symbol folders.<br/>
<br/>
Note the the bug also exists if one is using the Plant Database and calls the Update Plant Data command.<br/>

If they edit a plant style or click the Settings button in the Obj Info palette with a plant selected, then click Plan View Effects, the radio buttons and and associated Document... and Custom... buttons fade in and out of visibility and making them almost impossible to be clicked (see attached video).<br/>

I had the user send us through the diagnostics from their machine (see attached) and noticed they had an external display. I got them to disconnect the display and reopen Vectorworks, however the problem persisted.<br/>

Turning on &quot;Rasterize print output(Very Slow)&quot; in the print dialog may solve the problem.<br/>
If turning off &quot;Use GDI+ imaging&quot;, I can&#39;t confirm the problem.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the behavior is concerned, it is similar to the Fuji Xerox printer case (VB-163834) that I inquired about in the past, so there is a possibility that it is related.<br/>
In addition, it is possible to avoid this by disabling the option to use &quot;Use GDI+ imaging&quot; or exporting Vectorworks PDF, but some users are particular about outputting in Adobe PDF and cannot set this option. Please investigate and correct the problem.<br/>

<br/>
The problem seems to occur when they are behind their proxy server, they confirmed it doesn&#39;t occur if they disable the proxy. <br/>
<br/>
And according to their investigation, Cineware.exe connects to IP: 138.201.129.41 via port 443 (the destination is &quot;mx-inet05.maxon.net”) after ran Renderworks, it doesn&#39;t occur if they added the destination to the bypass list of their proxy. <br/>
<br/>
We are also behind a proxy on our office, but we couldn&#39;t reproduce the problem.<br/>
We guess their proxy setting is extremely strict.<br/>
<br/>
The user would like to know as follows<br/>
1) Does the inter-process communication between Vectorworks.exe and Cineware.exe connect via &quot;mx-inet05.maxon.net&quot;?  <br/>
Because of able to use Vectorworks even offline, unlikely to think like this, but the user suspects it has something relation with &quot;maxon.net&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
2) Does Vectorworks.exe or Cineware.exe connect to &quot;.cloudfront.net&quot; and &quot;.amazonaws.com&quot; while running any Renderworks rendering?<br/>

Tech support answer:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I had one of our Marionette experts look at this node and it does appear to be working in a way that I would not expect. Right now that node needs the curves to be selected, which Marionette networks can’t do unless they’re converted to menu commands. They are looking into re-writing that node to accept inputs. <br/>
<br/>
One potential workaround could be to Select all the 2D objects and extrude them to 0”.  Then use the following command to get NURBS surfaces.<br/>
<br/>
Modify &gt; Convert &gt; Convert to NURBS<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

In 27.0.2(627588) (current SP2.1 release) when you change the fill opacity, the pen opacity changes with it to the same value. You can drag&#39;n&#39;drop or manually type in some value, but it always snaps back to the value set by the fill opacity.<br/>

If using the Attribute Node (vs. Set Class Node) is for the purpose of setting a set of custom attributes, linking the pen to the fill opacity doesn&#39;t sound plausible.<br/>
<br/>
Please unlink the pen from the fill opacity.

                KLS: Download of BIMobjects not working with Vectorworks web browser but in external browser

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
using BIMobject customers could download object by an internal web browser.<br/>
but this does not work properly.<br/>
E.g. roof windows from Roto do not get downloaded.<br/>
If customer does the very same using an external browser, then it works.<br/>
Guess that&#39;s a bug.<br/>
<br/>
The internal Vectorworks web browser should also download the BIMobjects. But instead there is a message, that the file format is not supported. along with a list ofile formats like vwx, dxf, dwg, skp and 3ds.<br/>
Okay, Roto does not provide vwx, but they provide 3ds.<br/>
So I would expect the Vectorworks web browser to download at least the 3ds files and not getting a message that there is no supported file format.<br/>
<br/>
The current workaround is to use an external browser. But the Vectorworks web browser should also work. This is annoying for customers and they get the impression, that Vectorworks does not really work.<br/>
<br/>

It also contains a number of obsolete and deprecated functions which I list here. I am not sure if they need to be there, since they cannot be used. I&#39;d suggest to add the obsolete/deprecated status, should they need to stay in the list.<br/>

You see this only when editing on of the extrudes. Export IFC and all those steps are displaced about a yard.

objects in wall displaced when IFC export 2x3. ifc 4 is fine.<br/>
German window based on a symbol. It seems that the symbol loses its height and get export on height = 0. But it should be 0,4m.<br/>
Using ifc 4 is fine. No displacement. Only 2x3.<br/>
Customer would use ifc 4 but here he misses the export option &quot;Export wall/slabs by components&quot;.

But with Export Separate Instances = True the wall closures are present.<br/>
See Video and testfile. Also my exported ifc-files.<br/>
<br/>
We had a discussion here at ComputerWorks and our ifc experts do have the opinion, that it is a bug that wall closures are missing with Export by Components = True.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think.<br/>
Bug or WAD.<br/>
WAD that Export Separate Instances = True exports the wall closures.<br/>

A new button in OIP for walls, roofs and slabs &quot;Data&quot;, which corresponds with the same field in the object style, does not transfer information to ifc tab, if it is placed from OIP. The only way to fill ifc values connected to Data fields is by editing style. See a clip for more info.<br/>
<br/>
From user&#39;s perspective, I would expect that, by selecting a wall and filling Data fields from OIP, I get unique values in ifc tab for this particular wall.<br/>

The same problem is in roofs and slabs.

Made several design layers active and switched between layers changing views to verify that unified view was off.<br/>

The user has inadvertently had Drop Shadows on by default.<br/>
The section viewports that the file should open on will show these. If you zoom in and out you will see the entire viewport but when stopped it will not display everything in it&#39;s entirety.<br/>
<br/>
You have to select to viewport and uncheck the Drop Shadow on the viewport. However once updated it still shows a Drop Shadow. If you go back to the design layer the model does not appear to have drop shadows applied. However you have to De-selct the objects then look at the Attribute palette. Here uncheck the Drop Shadow, update the viewport (that don&#39;t appear to need updating) and the Drop Shadow will go.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022 turning of Accelerated Graphics fixed it. In 2021 none of the 3 Display options in the Prefs did anything. <br/>

Render settings: Shaded / Renderworks type<br/>
<br/>
Stair setting example:<br/>
--Stair Settings&gt; Construction tab&gt; When “Stringer Extension at Stair Bottom” is set to “1” or higher, the boundary part of Stringer is displayed in red.<br/>
--Stair Settings&gt; Construction tab&gt; When “Riser Thickness” is “0”, Riser is displayed in red.<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction procedure:<br/>
1) Open the sample file &quot;12905.vwx&quot;. The Stair object is placed inside the clip cube. The rendering setting is set to &quot;Shaded&quot; and the view is set to &quot;Right Isometric&quot;.<br/>
2) Select the Stair object and click &quot;Settings ...&quot; in OIP.<br/>
3) Open the Construction tab of the Stair Settings dialog, check that &quot;Stringer Extension at Stair Bottom&quot; is set to &quot;100&quot; and &quot;Riser Thickness&quot; is set to &quot;0&quot;, and click the OK button to close the dialog.<br/>
4) When checking the Stair object, the boundary part of the Stringer at the bottom is displayed in red. Also, Riser is displayed in red.<br/>

                Stair Guardrail Frame Bar inconsistent height on stair vs. landing 
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I was review VB-192017 for initiating when I notice an issue I couldn&#39;t resolve using the current Stair Settings.  Perhaps this requires a VE, but starting with a VB in case there is something I am missing....first to admit, I am not a stair expert.<br/>
<br/>
I attached a Vectorworks file and some images.  I was trying to create the type of stair set up the user wanted in VB-192017.  Since the user required a guardrail bar to run at 21&quot;, I used the Frame section to create this.  As can be seen in the images and file, that guardrail bar does not meet/bend at the post like the Handrail and Guardrail between the stair and landing.  This is just one of the issues causing that may cause the bar to be at a different distance from the Tread to the Guardrail on the stairs vs. the landing. <br/>
<br/>
Also noticed the vertical height between the Tread and the Guardrail is different on the stairs vs. landing.  According to the diagrams/images in the Stair Setting, the Guardrail is measured vertically and the Frame measured at an angle.  This might also be affecting the change in distance between the tread and the Guardrail Frame bar.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to discuss more if you have questions or need clarifying.<br/>

Generally when the eyedropper settings box is checked to transfer plugin settings, I user expects it to respect the location and Path only. For example, the eyedropper should not change a sloping railing/fence object to horizontal, since this is NOT a PIO setting.However most if not all settings are ignored.<br/>

<br/>
I have tried saving the correct fence as a symbol but that does not fix it.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the slope is taken out of the fence, the top rail returns to its correct position.  User indicates that these were drawn with the 3D line tool.<br/>
<br/>
I found raising the height of one end of the working top rail fences will not flip the top rail over.  In my screenshot, the fence that is not sloped can be raised on either end without issue.

<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in each version.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021, note that the label gets translated correctly (the &quot;Space Convert&quot; symbol is still applied).<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, note that the label symbol gets replaced with a generic one named &quot;Space Tag-Simple w/ Area&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2023, note that the Space has no label at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I save the file in VW 2021 and then open it in 2022 or 2023 it works fine, so this only seems to happen when translating directly from the older-version format.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
It is not possible to create multiple Bitmaps at the same time with Render Bitmap Tool.<br/>
<br/>
In Render Bitmap Tool, if another range is specified again with the render bitmap tool during the Bitmap creation process, the Bitmap creation that was being executed earlier will be interrupted, and an incomplete Bitmap will be created.<br/>
<br/>
In v2019 and lower versions, even if you specify a different range in the middle of processing, both will create a normal Bitmap.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to determine whether this behavior is due to a specification change or a malfunction.<br/>

                Mac text objects do not always refresh after OIP style changes
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This may be a duplicate - I thought I had seen or filed this issue earlier, I am filing it again because I cannot find a similar issue in JIRA.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac sometimes a text object will fail to update fully when a style change is made via the OIP. For example, a change of font, style, or size may change the bounding box of the text, but the text content will not actually redraw until the mouse is moved over the drawing view (or zoom or similar action forces a redraw).<br/>
<br/>
I saw this quite a bit in the latest 28.0 acceptance test on Ventura, though it seemed to happen less the more I continued.<br/>
<br/>
I am attaching a video which shows two occurrences of the bug.<br/>
<br/>
The first, at 0:31, involves a text size change from 14pt to 11pt which changes the selection box size but does not actually change the appearance of the text until the mouse is moved into the drawing area.<br/>
<br/>
The second, at 0:49, involves a font change from American Typewriter to Andale Mono. Again, the selection handles of the text object move as if it has been resized, but the text content is not actually re-rendered until the mouse is moved into the drawing area.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this occur with other changes too such as turning on bold or outline, and also on Undo/Redo of these types of changes. However as the video shows it is not consistent, sometimes the refresh works fine.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe this bug is new.

<br/>
The VW Pref &quot;Center on objects after view change&quot; is supposed to center the view on your objects [either the selected object(s), or all objects if there&#39;s no selection] whenever you switch among standard views. It works fine inside Groups and when not inside any containers.<br/>
<br/>
However, it currently does NOT work inside Symbols, or when inside Solid Additions, Subtractions, and other Solid types. This might also affect other container types too (?) <br/>
<br/>
This bug slows down work and makes designing feel quite &quot;frustrating&quot; since objects are constantly flying off the screen.<br/>

Since it is not a crash, there are no User Logs or .dmp files of use for this case.<br/>

All Anti-Virus are turned off and the Client uses Windows 10. Now he had informed us that this is happening in a second computer, as well.<br/>

We do ask for help with this case, as we do not know why the cinerender.dll is not letting Vectorworks 23 to start in both computers.<br/>

                Parameter Lists Differ Between Worksheets and Data Tag Dynamic Text : JBC

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In both database worksheets and data tag dynamic text, one can choose a PIO or record to work with, and then get a list of all available parameters which is great. There is however, a seemingly inexplicable difference between these lists, which you can see in the attached screen shot for the Existing Tree tool.<br/>
<br/>
The list in the data tag contains fewer items than the worksheet list, and the parameters that appear to be missing are those that are set not to appear in the OIP because their name begins with a double underscore, but their alternate name is NOT __NNA_DO_NOT_CHANGE or equivalent.<br/>
<br/>
I used the Existing Tree as an example, but for me the problem arises in WinDoor where the user fields do not appear in the Data Tag list (see second screen shot). Because the user fields don&#39;t appear in the Data tag, the users are not aware that these fields are available, yet they contain some of the most commonly used information.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

Option &quot;Always display the Edit Tag Data dialogs&quot; is active, because customer wants to type in text to moment he inserts the tag.<br/>

What happens is, the there is no increment. But you can type in text. This is when option &quot;Always display the Edit Tag Data dialogs&quot; is active.<br/>
<br/>
So customer deactivates that option.<br/>
What happens is, that there is a increment each time a data tag is placed into the drawing. But no window opens to type in user-entered field.<br/>
Customer has to do this afterwards which means more clicks and is annoying.<br/>

This only happens with the German Version. I could not reproduce this with any of the Railing objects in the US Version.<br/>

1. Open an empty file with the German Version.<br/>
<br/>
2. Select the Geländer/Zaun Tool (Railing/Fence) that is in the Architecture section.<br/>

3. Open Geländer/Zaun Settings.<br/>

4. Go to Basiceinstellungen and in Vorgaben Kategorie select the &quot;Staketengeländer ohne Pfosten&quot;.<br/>

Result: The Settings Thumbnail image on the right will not change to that one. All other Railings work correctly.

So in numbering doors we have to use &quot; D01, D02, D03...&quot;etc instead of &quot;D1, D2, D3&quot; so that the Graphic Legend will keep them in numeric order. Otherwise we get D1, D10, D11, D2, D3....<br/>
 <br/>
The default program code should accommodate normal human numbering sequence.

<br/>
Here the report from a customer:<br/>
&quot;Unfortunately, there seems to be a problem with Mac (system Monterey) in interaction with Wacom products: If I go with the pen to a tool in the tool groups and want to call a &quot;sub-tool&quot; (nested tool) there, it does not work. Example: Go with the mouse in the tool groups on rectangle &amp;gt; hold down the mouse button on the rectangle &amp;gt; a small window pops up and you have the choice to select between &quot;rectangle&quot; and &quot;radius rectangle&quot;. Works also with the trackpad (hold down). But not with the Wacom pen. No matter which Wacom (see above) is tested.The whole thing I have tested both with VW2021, as well as with VW2023. So far I have worked in the same hardware configuration with 10.15.7 (Catalina). Here this error does not occur. (VW2019 - VW2022)With all other installed programs, this error also definitely does not occur (Affinity-Designer, -Photo, -Publisher, Cinema 4D (R21), Capture One 22, Rhino 7, Moment of Inspiration 4.0, Adobe-Photoshop, -Illustrator, -InDesign etc.)This error demonstrably occurs exclusively with Vectorworks + Monterey. Various attempts with system restart, parameter ram reset, SMC reset, safe system start etc. do not lead to a change of the situation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you please help?<br/>
By the way, customer still has SP1 because we haven&#39;t released SP2 yet.<br/>

Ref file has a wall with a tile fill of one component. It&#39;s the insulation. From that wall there is a section viewport on design layer. And this viewport gets referenced to Master file.<br/>
<br/>
Watt happens is, that the insulation , meaning the tile, is missing.<br/>
We consider this a bug. Please fix it.<br/>
<br/>
There is a workaround: Do not use the tile fill, but use class style with tile fill. That would work.

<br/>
Some Section Viewports simply refuse to render the Shaded render pass. I typically set Background Render to Shaded and Foreground Render to Hidden Line. The Hidden Line part works fine. And I think the Background Render works okay if it&#39;s set to a Renderworks mode, so the issue seems to be related to Shaded mode.<br/>
<br/>
There are no &#39;Extents&#39; set up for the Section VP so that&#39;s not the issue, nor is it a jogged section.<br/>

In 2021 the ifc-export seems to be fine. In 2022 objects seem to be missing.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly assume the conversion from 2021 to 2022 failed.<br/>
Perform for example command Reset All Plug-Ins. In under a minute Vectorworks does crash.<br/>
That&#39;s why we assume, something went wrong with the conversion from 2021 to 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Generally the question is, why the ifc-export misses objects in 2022.

Compare to an apprpriate ifc-Viewer.<br/>
Only one grid axis after import visible while ifs-viewer shows grid for all layers.<br/>
Some Windows are displayed different.<br/>
Some walls seem to be exploded, meaning they have objects far away.<br/>
These are all minor issues. And maybe it is not Vectorworks but the ifs-file.<br/>
Nevertheless it could help improving the ifc-import interface.

Attached Document contains some &quot;Break Opening CW&quot; Objects. I am able to add those PIOs to the Modificator Group. <br/>
<br/>
It fails by IFC Export, if i have enough of that modificators in the slab. Just delete those volumes as normal Extrusions works without any problem. But with the PIO Modificators it fails. Would be nice if you can take a look at that. <br/>
I am not sure, this issue can be solved by the developper of the &quot;Break Opening&quot; or this can be fixed by IFC Export.

The Checkbox &quot;Export Walls/Slabs by Components&quot; leads to missing slabs with drainages. I know, that in the current version of Vectorworks components of slabs with drainages can&#39;t exported to IFC. But Vectorworks should export the slabs with drainages without components regardless of the setting of this checkbox.<br/>

 2. I can reproduce in 2021 and 2022<br/>
<br/>
The Project is quite big. The customer initially reported, that frequently, dimensions are not commited with project-sharing so I tried to reproduce that and found that behavior. Somehow I hope, that this also has a negative effect to PS but i guess not that one. Normally PS Issue would have high or critical Importance but I guess this specific behavior from this report do not affect. I hope I find the other dimension workflow which breaks the undo object list.<br/>

Notice the Trailer test &quot;Max&quot; does not show up. The Leader text &quot;Min.&quot; is visible.<br/>
<br/>
Note the dimension text offset is set to 1/2&quot;. The results are not adequate. The Note text partially covers the dimension line.<br/>
<br/>
Set the dimension std. to &quot;Arch&quot; Now the dimension text offset is 3 1/8&quot;. Both the Leader and Trailer texts are visible.<br/>
<br/>
Switch back to metric and note the text offset is 3 1/8&quot; but the note text is not located correctly.

However, in the drawing area, it&#39;s impossible to select the Dimension object via clicking on the Note text. There is no response when clicking on the text which is a little confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Example file attached. Go into the VP annotations then try selecting the radial dimension by clicking on the &quot;Same center point as archways&quot; text.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, clicking on the Note text should select the Dimension object. If this were a VE, I&#39;d also suggest adding the ability to edit the Note text in place as if it were a regular Text object.

                Radial dimension unreliable on VP annotation poly with multiple arc segments

</td>

The file should open to a sheet layer, with a Viewport that shows the polyline as it lives in the Design Layer, plus a duplicate copy of this polyline pasted into Viewport Annotations.<br/>
<br/>
Notice in the recording, that for the Design Layer poly, I can easily add a Radial Dimension to the smaller arc segment. However, when I try the exact same thing on the Annotation poly, the Radial Dimension is place on the incorrect arc segment. No matter what I do I can&#39;t get it to dimension the smaller arc segment; it always sticks to the larger arc segment even though I&#39;m not clicking on it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m troubleshooting, I just noticed: if I switch the poly&#39;s FILL to NONE, then the issue goes away. It&#39;s almost like the Radial Dimension tool is &quot;seeing&quot; the white pie-shaped fill of the large arc segment, even though it&#39;s not really there since the arc is composed into a polyline. This might be causing it to &quot;see&quot; the larger arc segment as being &quot;in front of&quot; the smaller arc segment? Screenshot of this hypothesis attached as well.

Often when I select items with it the items appear selected in the workspace.  They are all highlighted and work properly.  However in the OIP it only appears as a single item selected.  If I want to change something to all the items in the oip I have to edit something in the OIP and then it will show all the items selected and apply whatever changes to all.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is not how this should work.  It always appears to me that this is a VW issue not a plug in issue as it is related to the OIP. <br/>

As you can see from the movie, if the lighting devices have their colour changed directly via the OIP then the &#39;Draw Beam as a 3D solid&#39; shows the new colour.<br/>
If you do the same via the Find &amp; Modify command, the &#39;Draw Beam as 3D solid&#39; does not change. This is in spite of the Label Legend correctly changing, and a run of the &#39;Refresh Lighting Devices&#39; command.<br/>

                Tooltips in concatenated strings are confusing
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Many tooltips that appear on mouseover show what a tool mode or function is, which is highly useful to the user. However, many of these tooltips are concatenated strings. For instance, mode-indicating tooltips are composed of tool name + mode, which works fine in English. Not in Spanish, where many mistranslations occur.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the below screenshot, the tooltips for the three Polygon tool modes are shown: *Inscribed Mode* ({color:#00875a}*Modo Inscrito*{color}), *Circumscribed Mode* ({*}{color:#00875a}Modo Circunscrito{color}{*}) and *Edge Mode* ({*}{color:#00875a}Modo Borde{color}{*}). The current Spanish translations for these modes cannot be edited or improved because the strings making up these tooltips are concatenated. The desired translations, {color:#00875a}*Modo polígono inscrito*{color}, {*}{color:#00875a}Modo polígono circunscrito{color}{*}, {color:#00875a}*Modo borde definido*{color}, respectively, are more informative translations for the user . Concatenated strings are _*not*_ a best practice for localization purposes and should be discontinued. <br/>
<br/>
*Recommendation:* replace {color:#4c9aff}_*all concatenated strings*_{color} for tooltips and similar mouseover texts with full strings so that they can be properly localized for a better user experience.<br/>
<br/>
We understand that this may be a significant undertaking (hundreds of tooltips) but it has to be done to improve the Spanish user interface of future versions, as well as provide a better English UI for localization into the other languages served by Vectorworks.

<br/>
Hi folks!<br/>
<br/>
We have received reports from an organization which is experiencing Blue Screens error messages &quot;driver_power_state_failure&quot; triggered by inactivity/sleep/powerchange.<br/>
<br/>
This happens only when using Vectorworks and it happens in multiple machines within the organization.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what could be causing the crash? <br/>
<br/>
Any troubleshooting you may recommend? <br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate any help you can provide. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

                Double or triple bizarre bug: Data Tags in Multi View in Shaded render and/or Wireframe behave very badly.

 * open [^tag_issue_small.vwx]<br/>
 * set the top view pane to be 2D/Plan view<br/>
notice the bottom view pane shows the text wrong.  Something is confusing the textures used for the bottom view pane, somehow<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
In the enclosed file and movie you will see a library file of some Hoists. Multi View is used with different visibilities. Top window is in Top Plan and the bottom an isometric in a Shaded render. Each Hoist has a Data tag (DT) attached.<br/>
<br/>
This report +was+ going to be about the fact that the text in the Shaded render suddenly didn&#39;t read and were all a grey box. After restarting the computer it still happened.<br/>
<br/>
Playing around with Wireframe and Shaded revealed something else. If the Top Plan view was changed to 3D and rendered in Shaded the text appeared correctly in the bottom rendered window. Mostly, although some lines in the DT were solid.<br/>
<br/>
If the top window that was Top Plan, then Shaded went back to Top Plan the bottom window shows the Dts now with totally different outputs to the same ones in the Top Plan view. It bizarrely means the data tags text is totally incorrect in one window.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that this is something to do with Multi Views, Shaded rendering of Text and Data Tags themselves. I&#39;ll leave that up to you!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Peter<br/>

                Spotlight Speaker Tool Snap to Lighting Pipe Inconsistency
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When inserting speakers while snapping to a lighting pipe (or straight truss), the speakers are inconsistently inserted either at the height of the hanging position (expected behavior) or at z=0 (the floor), while remaining &quot;connected&quot; to the hanging position (&quot;Position&quot; will report that they are on the hanging position in the OIP) and the speakers will move in x, y, and z planes when the hanging position is moved.  While testing, on 4 separate occasions a crash was triggered while inserting a speaker (logs attached): crash occurred while testing both 2023 SP 1 and 28.0.x (SP3).<br/>
h3. Steps to Reproduce Bug<br/>
 # (Optional) Start from reboot<br/>
 # Launch Vectorworks 2022 or 2023 (occurs more frequently in 2023)<br/>
 # Create a new blank document<br/>
 # Change to Spotlight Workspace if not already there<br/>
 # Reset all Snap Preferences to defaults<br/>
 # Use the Lighting Pipe tool in the Rigging Tool Set to insert a Lighting Pipe long enough to insert multiple speakers (longer than 15ft.) and with a z-height greater than the height of the speakers you will insert (greater than 4ft.)<br/>
 # Select the Speaker tool from the Event Design Tool Set<br/>
 # Select Insert by Symbol Mode (selected by default) in Mode Bar (though behavior also occurs in Insert by Catalog Mode)<br/>
 # Select a speaker symbol from the pull-down menu in the Mode Bar (or use Default/Generic Speaker)<br/>
 # Insert multiple speakers along the lighting pipe, clicking when the red diamond-with-crosshairs cursor aid indicates that the speaker will be &quot;hung&quot; on that position<br/>
 # Observe the z-heights of the speakers, either in the OIP or in a 3D view<br/>
 # (Optional) Repeat steps 6-11 with Straight Truss tool instead of Lighting Pipe tool<br/>
<br/>
h3. Notes<br/>
 * It&#39;s hard to consistently reproduce the unexpected behavior, but it seems like the &quot;snap to hanging position&quot; criteria are different than other snap criteria. Moving the cursor within the &quot;snap to hanging position&quot; reticle while not directly over the hanging position can sometimes cause the unexpected behavior. Possibly easier to reproduce when more zoomed out.<br/>
 * Unexpected behavior occurs in both Insert by Symbol Mode and Insert by Catalog Mode<br/>
 * Builds tested:<br/>
 ** 2021 SP 5 (622768) - all speakers insert at z=0 but are connected to lighting pipe/truss, move when lx pipe/truss moved.<br/>
 ** 2022 SP 5 (664120) - some speakers insert on lighting pipe/truss, some insert at z=0, all are connected to lx pipe/truss and move when lx pipe/truss is moved<br/>
 ** 2023 SP 1 (672648) - some speakers insert on lighting pipe/truss, some insert at z=0, all are connected to lx pipe/truss and move when lx pipe/truss is moved<br/>
 ** 28.0.x (678727) - some speakers insert on lighting pipe/truss, some insert at z=0, all are connected to lx pipe/truss and move when lx pipe/truss is moved. This build seems most inconsistent.<br/>
 ** 27.0.6 (680324) and 28.0.2 (680333) on Win 11 (64-bit): similar behaviors as above

                VW2023SP0 Shaded with &#39;Draw edges&#39; on and in perspective, produces prolific graphical anomalies

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This relates to [this Forum discussion|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/87645-vw2022-shaded-view-flickering-hatches-patterns/] which has been contributed to by both Vectorworks staff Joseph Block and Dave Donley.<br/>
<br/>
This issue was present in Vectorworks 2022 and continues in Vectorworks 2023.<br/>
<br/>
While using &#39;Shaded&#39; render mode with &#39;Draw edges&#39; ON in Design Layers, object surfaces display with graphical anomalies all over them. The following are factors in whether the lines appear at all and to what degree:<br/>
 * View must be:<br/>
 -- In perspective<br/>
 -- Rendered in Shaded<br/>
 -- …with &#39;Draw edges&#39; ON<br/>
 -- At an angle between ~30 and ~80 degrees off the surface(s) in question. <br/>
 -- At a particular distance from the object(s) in question. <br/>
 * Larger crease angles (in &#39;Shaded Options&#39;) makes them disappear and smaller crease angles make them more likely to appear and increases the number of graphical anomalies that appear. (See attached video).<br/>
 * [Suspected] The more geometry present, the more readily they appear, *but* you can start to see them when only a single, short wall is present, but at the right zoom level. <br/>
<br/>
This problem must relate to the graphical representation of edges (&#39;Draw edges&#39;) because increasing the &#39;Edge thickness&#39; in the Shaded Options dialog will increase the thickness of all graphical anomalies. <br/>
<br/>
If you have any Vectorworks-vindicating or hope-inspiring findings, please take a moment to contribute any appropriate news/progress/information to that discussion as some high-profile users are engaged with this matter and the OP &#39;line-weight&#39; is fatigued by Vectorworks issues which he seems to encounter more often than most users.

Notice colors are wrong. Filter color (and possibly other parameters) of a Renderworks Texture are not included in the exported texture images.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When exporting an OBJ, textures that have a &quot;Filter&quot; color in the Color Shader are not incorporating that color into the exported texture image. Only the grayscale version is being exported (see attached screengrabs). In this example, the texture image is a subtle &quot;paint&quot; texture and the filter color is being used to determine the paint color. However, the exported OBJ looks white because the OBJ textures contain none of that color information.<br/>
<br/>
This is *catastrophically bad* for sharing models with VFX vendors in the film industry.<br/>
<br/>
This problem was already addressed for FBX (VB-177018) and Datasmith (VB-177018) but now the same fix needs to applied to OBJ. Please check all other export types too since this needs to be consistent.<br/>

<br/>
When using the Spigot Connection on Straight Truss, there is an issue with the 2D and 3D not lining up when connecting two pieces of truss.  So when the truss is connected as expected in 3D, there is a gap in 2D.<br/>
<br/>
Then a length of spigot truss is drawn with smaller connection intervals than the length, this doesn&#39;t look as it should (spigots are overlapping too much).  However, the 2D and 3D match up.<br/>
<br/>
Images, and file have been included.  Video will be added shortly.<br/>
<br/>
I understand Straight Truss is not the recommended Truss tool, but in case this can be easily fixed I wanted to make note of the issue.

I was working on the file to assess the capacity and size of various curved options. I adjusted the boundary with the Reshape Tool, checked the seating numbers, and then adjusted the boundary again. On every occasion, the boundary path would inconsistently appear as paths with many control points making the adjustment of the boundary on a radius difficult and time-consuming.<br/>
If I altered the control points by deleting the extra control points back to a single arc control point, it would revert the next time it was opened, but not always. <br/>
The layer with Option B has single a radius to each curve, Options C and D have morphed into having multiple control radii.

                Tape Measure gives erroneous results when inside Annotations and snapping to other viewports
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When you&#39;re inside the Annotations of a Viewport and use the Tape Measure tool to measure something that resides in a different viewport (of the same scale), one would assume that you should get accurate measurements, since measurements are world-based when inside Annotations.<br/>
<br/>
However, in this scenario you get niether accurate world-based measurements NOR the corresponding page-based measurements. What you get instead are nonsensical measurements that are much larger than they should be. I believe that the scale factor of the viewports is being factored in TWICE. For example, when inside a 1:16 viewport, then snapping to geometry that&#39;s inside a different 1:16 viewport, the Tape Measure readings are 16x what they ought to be.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this issue first began a couple versions ago when the ability was added to use the Tape Measure while directly on a Sheet Layer to take world-based measurements from a viewport (when not in Annotations). This was a great improvement, however the code seems to have infiltrated to inside Annotations as well, leading to these erroneous Tape Measure measurements.<br/>

As the Summary indicates, the shortcut Alt+M that activates the Tape Measure Tool does not work when working in a floating view pane OR having the drawing detached from Vectorworks and active in a second monitor instead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How to reproduce the problem:<br/>
<br/>
1. With the German Version open a blank document.<br/>
<br/>
2. Draw a couple objects, doesn&#39;t matter which.<br/>
<br/>
3. Activate the &quot;Mehrere Ansichtsfenster&quot; (Multiple View Panes).<br/>
<br/>
4. As example, right click on the Right Top Pane and select &quot;Ansichtsfenster im Eigenem Fenster&quot; (Create Floating View Pane).<br/>
<br/>
5. Now press Alt+M to activate the Tape Measure Tool. Nothing happens.<br/>
<br/>
6. Click the &quot;Mehrere Ansichtsfenster&quot; (Multiple View Panes) Off and back On again.<br/>
Now Alt+M works.

railing loses it‘s texture when railing gets rotated.<br/>

It is working when plate of the railing has a filling like solid. Here in this case the filling is none and there is the texture only. <br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Open the file in VW 2021<br/>
-Double-click the surface to activate the Reshape tool <br/>
-Draw a selection marquee around a few vertices<br/>
-Now hold-down the Shift key and draw another marquee around another set of vertices<br/>
<br/>
Note that the marquee can be drawn with any size, as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try the same thing in VW 2022<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the marquee gets constrained and can only be drawn with certain shapes. This makes it really difficult to select the vertices that you want.<br/>
<br/>
This happens even if all snap constraints are disabled.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2022 SP0. This also happens in Mainline.<br/>

However, when rendered in Hidden Line, some of these 90° edges are not being drawn. I have my smoothing angle set at 30°, so there&#39;s no reason these edges shouldn&#39;t be drawn.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this problem only affects Perspective projection, as it seems to behave more reliably in orthographic projection.<br/>
<br/>
This has been an issue for a while, and it makes it quite challenging to create clear, legible viewports since geometry is missing. In many cases if I lower my smoothing angle I start to get extra edges that I don&#39;t want elsewhere, so that&#39;s not a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs to properly calculate smoothing angles based on the geometry, irrespective of POV or projection.

Comment by Nele: this happens on mac only. Not on windows and they have the same templates. I couldn&#39;t believe it myself, so I tested it also. But I can reproduce the issue on mac. I&#39;ll add the corresponding templates to the Jira case.<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue where to find the solution

<br/>
When Spacing is set to Single Space, ALL Vertical Alignment settings yield correct results.<br/>
<br/>
When the line spacing is specified by setting the Leading using the Set Spacing... option in the OIP Spacing menu, ALL Vertical Alignment settings yield correct results.<br/>
<br/>
Setting the Vertical Alignment of a text block using the VectorScript call SetTextVertAlignN() yields the same results as setting the Vert. Align manually in the OIP.<br/>
<br/>
Setting the Vertical Alignment of a text block using the older VectorScript call SetTextVerticalAlign() moves the text block incorrectly for Bottom Baseline (4), but all other settings (1-3, &amp; 5) yield the expected result.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you select a text block and run the attached script &quot;Show Vert Align Y&quot;, it will place a Locus on each of the Vertical Alignment locations and create a text block showing the X&amp;Y values for each of the 5 alignment points.<br/>
<br/>
This problem even exists for single lines of text when the line spacing is set to 1-1/2 Space or Double Space and the Vertical Alignment is set to Bottom Baseline, even though these configurations are somewhat meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve observed this problem exists at least back to VW 2015, but it worked correctly in VW 12.5 and earlier.

                T02121 Cropped perspective option is very difficult to access with legacy 2D options
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      While most work benefits from having Cropped Perspective off, a handful of use cases still benefit from it, particularly sightline, camera, projection, or lighting studies where you need the ability to pan and zoom the image to analyze exactly what is in view from that perspective point.<br/>
<br/>
In files created in 2022 and above, this is the procedure necessary to turn on cropped perspective:<br/>
- Open Document Preferences<br/>
- Switch to the Legacy 2D tab<br/>
- Turn on Enable Legacy 2D Features<br/>
- Close the dialog with OK<br/>
- Re-open the dialog again<br/>
- Switch to the Display tab<br/>
- Enable Cropped perspective<br/>
- Close the dialog with OK<br/>
<br/>
For someone truing to turn on cropped perspective, this is a very circuitous route, and less than ideal UI.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, enabling legacy 2D should immediately make Cropped Perspective visible without relaunching the dialog. Also, Cropped Perspective does not seem to depend on the Legacy 2D preference actually being enabled — it merely controls the visibility in the dialog, which is a bug.<br/>
<br/>
I would advocate for one of these options, however:<br/>
- Move Cropped Perspective to the Legacy 2D tab. Again, Cropped Perspective does not actually depend on the Legacy option, so it would always be visible and editable. (I prefer this option)<br/>
- Have Cropped Perspective grayed on the Display tab, with a note that Legacy 2D be enabled to use cropped perspective. In this case, Cropped perspective SHOULD be changed so it is dependent on the legacy 2D option.

<br/>
When we double mouse click a Vectorworks file to open, it will always open with the Viewer instead of the Vectorworks Version (eg. 2023 SP1). This also happens if we right mouse click and select open with Vectorworks 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Its expected that the Vectorworks full version would have priority over the Viewer, when opening a file in this manner and not the other way around ... other possibility could be after mouse clicking to pop-up an option asking if we want to open with the full version or with the Viewer.

If I selected details in the security alert window, Avira&#39;s antivirus scanner &quot;Luke Filewalker&quot; started and the installation was canceled every time immediately. The installation only succeeded when I left the Security Alert window untouched. I then looked in Avira&#39;s quarantine log and found several files that probably belong to the VW2023 installation. The program seems to start despite this, but I feel some concern that important files may not have been installed correctly or have been quarantined.

In case we choose &quot;do not import, use current&quot;, you&#39;d expect the material in the slab component to have the 2D attributes as set in the material. Unfortunately, this is not what happens. The slab keeps its default 2D fill, until we unlink the material from that slab component manually and link it again. This step shouldn&#39;t be necessary in order to make things function as expected.

<br/>
Hello!  I spoke with a guy recently who ran into crashing in Vectorworks but only when he had Microsoft Teams meeting open.  In order to relaunch Vectorworks, he has to end the meeting and then restart the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached the Crash Logs and .dmp files I was able to get from their computer, as well as a DX Diag.  I&#39;ve heard of other users running into crashing with Microsoft Teams as well, so I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s some other issue happening.  This is for Vectorworks 2022 specifically, but I think I&#39;d heard of others encountering it on 2023.  I&#39;ll add any additional logs and update this if I encounter any other users running into similar crashes.<br/>
<br/>
For future reference, this user is Frank Garnier (garnier@groundreconsidered.com) in case we need to reach back out.  I hope to hear more information on this soon and have a great day!  :)

 * open [^66_67 - House Model - 12.29.22.vwx]<br/>
notice one of the walls is missing edges in Plan view. when panning, the wall shows correctly. maybe an issue with wall components (in shaded, the components are missing). Deleting a particular window in the wall fixes the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION =====<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, one of the walls will not render properly in plan view unless the upper windows at one end are either removed, or set to be clerestory windows. When I tested this in a blank document with windows stacked on top of one another like in this file the wall appeared to render as expected. <br/>
<br/>
I have attached the file the customer sent in as well as one I created in my testing. <br/>
<br/>
The attached screenshot shows the windows in question highlighted. <br/>

greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Attached you find a VW 2023 Beta SP3 file with further instructions.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small but disturbing little thing with the unit settings.<br/>
<br/>
All “Length” don&#39;t have a space between number and unit.<br/>
“Area” and “Volume” aren&#39;t affected.<br/>
<br/>
Affected are:<br/>
UI, input fields, Worksheets, …<br/>
<br/>
You can help yourself with a &quot;Custom&quot; setting, but this<br/>
make problems with SIA-Dimensions (and maybe other stuff)<br/>
<br/>
I think a consistent way will be the best,<br/>
so “Length” should also get a Space between number and unit.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany and Merry Christmas<br/>
Tobi

<br/>
This is of course a security risk, as the user cannot tell whether the uninstaller they are running is the provided by Vectorworks, or one that some evildoer has sneaked in after Vectorworks was installed.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, some Windows 10/11 users will be unable to uninstall Vectorworks at all, if the security policies are enabled that prevent unsigned executables from being given the elevated permissions required to uninstall.<br/>
<br/>
This is particularly serious for Windows 11, as these policies appear to be enabled by default.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this affects all versions of Vectorworks.

<br/>
The issue is not immediately obvious because the first several course results are the same whether the New Features filter is applied or not. With the current content, a difference is not seen until the 19th result when applying the filter. Snapshots of a few rows of results are attached from selecting the New Features filter directly on the course web page. The same rows are captured from an instance of clicking New Features on the Home Screen. A comparison of the two shows the results are different starting at the 19th item.<br/>
<br/>
When clicking New Features on the Home Screen, the URL contains text to filter the results, but it sometimes changes to the default course link before the content is loaded.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, the initial link of [https://university.vectorworks.net/course/index.php?mycourses=0&amp;tagfilter%5Btype%5D=content+type-1-new+features&amp;medium=vectorworks_software&amp;source=homescreen&amp;content=learn]<br/>

Switches to [https://university.vectorworks.net/course/index.php#coursestab]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This issue IS intermittent and is seen on both Mac and Windows.

see attached customer file. It was created in a previous version of Vectorworks and converted.<br/>
See my video. If I move wall by mouse, the wall join is intact.<br/>
But if I move the very same wall by tool Move by points, then the wall join gets lost.<br/>
If I delete the left wall, then it works.<br/>
So there must be something corrupt in this wall network.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1) Open the sample file Sample221028-1.vwx.<br/>
<br/>
2) Select one of the viewports and go to &quot;Advanced Properties&quot; &gt; Extent tab.<br/>
   Please check the Length Range is set to &quot;Limited by Section Line Length&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3) Switch the active layer to &quot;aaa&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4) Select the Interior Elevation Marker and click &quot;Edit Section Lines&quot; on OIP. Please check that every endpoint of section lines is drawing until wall edges. Then go back to the sheet layer, the wall line on the left doesn&#39;t show on #2 and #4 viewports.<br/>
(*2022_1.png)<br/>
<br/>
5) Switch the active layer to &quot;aaa&quot; again.<br/>
<br/>
6) Delete the door and go back to the sheet layer. <br/>
(*2022_2.png)<br/>
<br/>
7) Select all viewports and update.<br/>
<br/>
8) The left wall line of #2 become to show, but the one of #4 is still invisible.<br/>
(*2022_3.png)<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to the attached movie.(movie13031.mov)<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks*<br/>
*It depends on Vectorworks version, which viewport lines don&#39;t show after deleting the door.<br/>
<br/>
In Vectorworks 2023, the line one the wall on the left of #2 still doesn&#39;t show even deleting the door.<br/>
(*2023_3.png)<br/>
<br/>
*This problem reproduces even though creating from a new file.<br/>
<br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Make sure the &quot;Center on objects after view change&quot; preference is enabled<br/>
- Enter the Symbol<br/>
- Select any object<br/>
- Change the view<br/>

Note that the view fails to center on the selected object.<br/>

This only seems to happen inside Symbols. <br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

Both of them have issues with the background render portion.

(Also, the amount of this chunk changes depending on the existence of other viewports on the page? This makes no sense...)

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Adjust the zoom level so that the entire poly is visible<br/>
- Drag it with the Selection tool<br/>
<br/>
Note that the interactive preview shows correctly at this point.<br/>
<br/>
- Now zoom-in on the poly as shown<br/>
- Drag it again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the interactive preview either fails to show or gets stuck.<br/>
<br/>
This only happens when the poly is on a 3D plane.<br/>
<br/>
This happens even when &quot;Accelerate Graphics&quot; is disabled.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in VW 2022 but not in VW 2021, so this looks like a regression.

                BUG: Rendering Transparency Datavisualization of 3D-Symbols (with/without Autohybrid)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi VW-Team,<br/>
<br/>
it seems that the transparency settings are not working as they should,<br/>
in combination with Datavisualization + 3D-Symbols (with / without AutoHybrid).<br/>
<br/>
We have two different settings for Transparency:<br/>
 * lines<br/>
 * fills <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It seems that the settings for fills, also affects the transparency<br/>
of lines for 3D-Symbols.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You can set a value for line-transparency, and it gives you the right<br/>
feedback, but only without a setting for fill-transparency.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you set a value for fill-transparency and no line-transparency,<br/>
the lines get a transparency too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have not checked if other 3D objects are also impacted.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is a test-file: VW 2023 SP2<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Greetings from Germany<br/>

<br/>
!image-2022-12-09-17-58-37-518.png!<br/>
<br/>
in this screen shot, I move the dimension string that is now 3&#39;-4&quot; to the right of grid line 3, to adjust the location of running string away from the walls it is dimensioning - in other words, not the dimension leader lines, just the offset.  the dimension string is in the annotation layer.  this caused the walls being dimensioned to unexpectedly move.  this is bad - I didn&#39;t notice this had happened when I first made the edit, but luckily I noticed it before sending the drawing out.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, adjusting elements in the annotation layer should never affect the location of elements in a design layer - <br/>
<br/>
See sheet layer A2.1 in the attached file -<br/>
<br/>
This is what it was before the dimension string move, and what it needs to look like -<br/>

                In Full Window mode, floating palettes once hidden do not come back
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      On the Mac I use floating palettes. If VW is set to use Full Screen, closing a floating palette causes it to stay hidden. If a palette is docked, then it can be closed and reopened easily with the keyboard shortcuts or the menus.<br/>
<br/>
If the workspace is changed then floating palettes are able to be shown once (if they were hidden), but they will not reopen again if they are subsequently closed.<br/>
<br/>
If the VW window is set to not be Full Screen, toggling floating palettes returns to normal operation.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
1) Set VW to Full Screen mode, either with menu Window &gt; Use Full Screen, or click the green button in the upper left corner of the VW window.<br/>
<br/>
2) Assuming the Resource Manager (RM) is already floating, toggle the the RM&#39;s visibility with CMD-R, or menu Window &gt; Palettes &gt; Resource Manager.<br/>
<br/>
3) Once it is hidden, it will not reopen with CMD-R, or the menu, until you either exit Use Full Screen mode, or switch workspaces.<br/>
<br/>
4) Return to Full Screen mode.<br/>
<br/>
5) If the OIP is docked, toggle its visibility with CMD-I, or the menu Window &gt; Palettes &gt; Object Info. It will close and reshow as expected.<br/>
<br/>
6) Detach the OIP so it is now a floating palette. Toggle its visibility with CMD-I and note that once it is hidden, it will not reopen. <br/>
<br/>
7) Leave Full Screen mode and all palettes will toggle visibility with their keyboard shortcuts, regardless of whether or not they are docked.<br/>
<br/>
This problem exists regardless of the &quot;Use Application Window&quot; menu setting. There may be other factors that affect this behavior, but I have not found any yet.<br/>
<br/>
I first noticed this in VW 2022, and then verified it persists in VW 2023. I just now opened VW 2015 and the problem exists there as well.

In both cases texture renders correctly in the shaded mode, but fails to render hatch on faces where &quot;texture tool&quot; is used.<br/>

We ran into a problem with a section fill of a viewport. When a colour is applied only some of the object take it as a change. Top side of the section viewport ignores it. I was trying to find out whats causing it and tried to export to 2022 which works with no problems. <br/>

Is there a reason for this happening? Maybe im missing something in 2023? <br/>

                Multi Views: Create a sheet layer viewport when one panel is active, and when you return to it, the view will have changed to Top Plan

In the enclosed file and movie you can see the file has two panels using Multi View. The top view is in a Shaded rendered perspective. <br/>
<br/>
Once that panel is active and a viewport is made onto a sheet layer, users are taken to that sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is that if you make a design layer active to view as before, the entire view has changed to Top Plan and not remained as it was.<br/>
<br/>
If Multi Views are not enabled and you repeat the process, when you return to the design layer(s) the view remains as before and has not changed to Top Plan but it does if Multi Views are enabled.<br/>

<br/>
====== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION =======<br/>
<br/>
Oftentimes, the clip cube produces unexpected artifacts. They seem to be floating polygons, always red ( the color of the section plane) and unpredictable. In the attached file, activate the &quot;perspective&quot; saved view; everything renders as expected. Now activate the &quot;clipped&quot; saved view. There are two red rectangles that do not correspond to any model geometry. See annotated screen shots.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this behavior for years and may have reported it before.

<br/>
Open the file we are attaching.<br/>
Launch a rendering process, for example Custom Renderworks and have a look at the resulting scene.<br/>
Now call the command Export Image file and have a look at the image gotten. There are evident differences between the r3sults of the two procedures, as you can see even in the images we are attaching. <br/>
<br/>
As a result, even the command Create Batch Render Job gives unexpected outcomes when you export the image.

<br/>
Which brings us to methods like GetViewportHiddenLineOptions that play a shell game of rearranging nodes to get the viewport settings into the global and back again. For Change Tracking we want to reduce or remove these sorts of unnecessary document changes. <br/>
<br/>
We could add a handle param to the existing function so it can work directly with different locations like a layer or viewport.  But some of the flavors of render options are also pushing up against the limit on the count of params that can be passed so that would require the argument count be reduced by combining bits or moving data into a struct. Or the pio API dropped.

During the rendering process, I used the mouse wheel to zoom out.<br/>

I zoomed out, stopped and VW crashed.<br/>

Tried to duplicate - it did not crash again. Maybe, you&#39;ll be able to see what happened.<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In order to build a complicated list of objects that meet a user&#39;s criteria, I used DATABASEBYSCRIPT() in the Database Row Formula. This works perfectly to build the list, but only when all items are listed, each on its own row. When I click the SUMMARIZE option in one of the column headers for a database row, the first item in the stacking order is set in its own summary group. All other items are summarized correctly. <br/>
<br/>
The problem can only be seen when there are multiple item of every type and the first item shows a quantity of &quot;1&quot; and somewhere in the list more items, similar to the first, are grouped into their own summary group. They should be grouped with the first item.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a VW file that has multiple rectangles, ovals, and lines. It also contains two Worksheets, one that use SUMMARIZE and one that does not. In each worksheet, there are two database rows. The first database row uses =DATABASE(ALL) for the database row formula, and the second database row uses =DATABASEBYSCRIPT(&#39;All Objects&#39;), essentially doing the same thing as the first database row but with an external script. <br/>
<br/>
When all items are listed in the database rows, i.e., no SUMMARIZE option is selected, the lists in each database row look identical. This is worksheet &quot;WS No Summarize&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When all items are summarized in the database rows, i.e., the column headers have the SUMMARIZE box checked, the list in the first database row looks correct but the list in the second database row has an extra entry. This is worksheet &quot;WS Summarize&quot;. Note the first line in the second database row has its first entry showing a quantity of &quot;1&quot;, while the same objects show later in the list with a quantity of &quot;2&quot;. They should all be in the same summary row and show a quantity of &quot;3&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To observe the problem:<br/>
Move objects around on the drawing by changing their stacking order, then Recalculate All Worksheets. Note that the item on the bottom of the Stacking Order is the item that is isolated in the first database row that uses DATABASEBYSCRIPT() in the Database Row Formula, and has Summarize checked in the first column.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This anomaly makes Worksheets useless that have to use the SUMMARIZE feature, and also need a custom script to build the database list.<br/>

                KLS: Text size suddenly multiplied by layer scale when switching through view panes

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi there,<br/>
attached is a customer file in which the slab drainage has a very bis text size. Guess it is multiplied by the layer scale.<br/>
We do have this regularly from our customers. Not too much to be alarmed, but too often to ignore this.<br/>
It mostly happens when customers work with multiple view panes and at least one view pane shows a sheet layer. Maybe clicking and working through these panes with different layer scales (1:1 by sheet layer and 1:50 or more by design layer) gets the text size confused.<br/>
In this case the slab drainage has a far too bis text size. Of course it can be repaired. Sometimes easy peasy and sometimes more difficult.<br/>
Maybe you heard of this from your customer? Or seen it in your support?<br/>
We are gonna ask the customer if he knows the steps to run into this.<br/>
I tried it on my own but could not run into it myself.<br/>
See testfile and video.

===== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION ===========<br/>
<br/>
See the attached file. There is a single render light with and ImageDef node attached to create a projection. <br/>
<br/>
The original image is pasted in the layer plane. You can see that an inscribed circle perfectly meets the corners of the rectangle.<br/>
<br/>
Also pasted is a shaded bitmap render of the projected image. You can see that the corners are getting clipped, making precise alignment of the image impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Renderworks and Redshift produce similar results.<br/>
<br/>
If this is by design, as a safeguard from an errant halo around the image, then this extra scaling needs to be documented. Better yet, the image projection routine should add empty pixels around the image rather than scaling it.<br/>

this is more a question than a bug.<br/>
From time to time it happens that the content of viewports suddenly is displaced.<br/>
Only way I know is to move the contents of the displaced viewports each by each.<br/>
This is time consuming.<br/>
Do you know a more elegant and faster way?<br/>
Second question: I noticed a class 0. Could it be, that a DXF/DWG-import causes such a displacement? If yes, is it possible to add a message warning of possible displacement in SLVP?<br/>
Thanks and Gruß, Klaus.

                                            <td class="description">      Hi there<br/>
See testfile SkylightDomedNURBS1.vwx.<br/>
In this file the glas of the skylight is displaced. The skylight is a 3D-symbol with NURBS only. The layer is related to stories. The displacement is the elevation of this layer.<br/>
When I create a new disign layer without connecting to stories and insert the symbol, then it is displaced too.<br/>
<br/>
When I copy paste the symbol into a new document (NewDocumentDesignLayerOnly.vwx) then no displacement.<br/>
When I copy paste the symbol into a new document with story related design layers (NewDocumentStory.vwx) then also no displacement.<br/>
<br/>
When I delete from SkylightDomedNURBS1.vwx.all stories and create a new design layer with relation to stories then no displacement. See SkylightDomedNURBS2.vwx.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what&#39;s happening in the file SkylightDomedNURBS1.vwx. How has this displacement evolved? I have seen such displacement before and always with stories and 3D-symbols.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can find out how this displacement was created? And also tell me a way how to get this repaired.<br/>
<br/>

                Mac - inserting Emoji and Symbols can cause bad text rendering and state

<br/>
UPDATE: I was able to reproduce this in VW2021, and have attached a file that exhibits the bug.<br/>
<br/>
If you insert multiple, different extended characters into a text object by choosing *Show Emoji &amp; Symbols* to launch the popover from the Mac text input menu, you can get into a state where the normal rendering of the text gets messed up (see screenshot). This looks like it might be another aspect of the general character-by-character unicode rendering vulnerability our Mac code has.<br/>
<br/>
Also however this can result in a bad keyboard-input state in general, where attempting to exit out of text editing, invoke a keyboard shortcut for undo or copy/paste, etc., causes a beep and has no effect. I think what may be happening in that case is the Emoji and Symbols popover is somehow going offscreen (behind the window?) while still being active, so even though we can&#39;t see it it is preventing additional keyboard interaction. Switching to another document/layer/application seems to get one out of this bad state.<br/>
<br/>
One additional aspect, the two times I saw this I also noted that as I typed space after inserting an emoji, a period got inserted into the text which I didn&#39;t type. This may also be a sign of some multi-byte unicode input problem.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep trying to determine a 100% reproducible sequence, and also determine whether it&#39;s a regression (I suspect not).

Expected: when in Top/Plan view, I would expect the text in the symbol to be flipped so it is readable as long as I have Adjust Flipped Text enabled in Document Preferences.<br/>

Actual: the mirrored instance on the 3D plane does not get its text adjusted. If I move it to the Screen Plane, it does.

To reproduce:<br/>

This definitely worked at some point in the past in VW 2022, but the problem now happens in both 2033 and 2023 so it may be a server problem on AutoTURN&#39;s  end.

<br/>
Layer Links are a legacy function in Vectorworks, but they are still supported. The object I included in the source file was a Design Layer Viewport. There were no Layer Links at all. <br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks should call Design Layer Viewports by their name to avoid confusion and to differentiate between them and Layer Links when they are present. <br/>

Multiple things:<br/>
 # According to the OIP, the VP is rotated 270°, instead.  This may or may not play into the next issue.<br/>

 # If in the VP advanced Properties dialog &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; is NOT selected some of the text (Hanging Position labels, Lighting Device Label Legends, Focus Position text, etc.) reads correctly (when the resulting print-out is rotated) and some does not - seemingly dependent on the rotation of the given element.  If &quot;Adjust Flipped Text&quot; IS selected, all of the text reads upside-down when the resulting print-out is rotated.

Closing the referenced drawing and doing a refresh of the viewport seems to put things back in place. <br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open the PF to create a new WF, and note that the wall components show correctly in Shaded mode<br/>
- Now edit the Wall style and click OK without making changes<br/>
- Save and Commit<br/>
- Close the WF, then open the PF to create a new WF<br/>
<br/>
Note that now some of the wall components fail to render. If you edit the style again the problem will fix itself, but that requires you to checkout all the walls of that style.<br/>
<br/>
I see the same problem in VW 2022 but not in VW 2021, so this might be related to Wall Modernization.

For a unknown reason, when you update the Viewport, it uses the document attribute and the strange markers show off.<br/>

<br/>
If you have walls with sloping top or bottom edges the wall end caps are in a few situations wrong / not sloped. For the bottom edge, a cut wall end cap might be correct, since there may be a bottom there. But what if the wall is in the air (like a joist). From my point of view, a wall with only 2 modification points should take the angle from below. If you add more modification points, you would always have to use the angle of the last partial element.<br/>

We can see that with VW22 the wall limit lines between floors are not being displayed in the Section Viewport, as expected. With VW23 the lines are being displayed and we do not see any options that could be causing this phenomena. Both VW22 and VW23 files have the exact same options active, that includes the Section Viewport in question.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this. Thank you in advance.<br/>

Note: when opening the v22 file with vw23, its correctly displayed, hence is there any specific file settings wrong with the v23 file that we cannot find or there is a file specific problem?

<br/>
When I try selecting a single light and dragging it on to the truss the auto-connect highlight will display but the light will still not move to the correct Z height to hang from the truss. <br/>
The file was created by a mac user (not sure which version of Mac OS)<br/>

This is the first time I have been able to recreate the issue of lights not correctly inserting on to trusses and hanging positions, since it looks like the main problem is Mac OS related and I use windows.

Attached is a Projectfile which is referenced into a Vectorworks-File.<br/>
The Lighting devices, attached to the pipes, are missing in the Vectorworks file, even when everything is activated.<br/>
<br/>
When opening the Project-File, everything seems to be correct.<br/>

Can you please check, if this is a bug with the lighting devices, Project Sharing or with References?<br/>

I duplicated that (now VP8) and switched to final renderworks and it rendered both properly.  I created a new VP on a new sheet layer and got the same undesired behavior.<br/>
<br/>
But if I open the file in Build 673231 and update VP1 I works properly.  But If I update VP7 which had already been updated with the undesired behavior I still get the undesired behavior.  I have isolated the problem to the floor on layer 1 Site.  If I delete the floor the malfunction goes away. But if I create a new floor of similar size the problem comes back.<br/>
<br/>
In VP9 I have just the 1 Site layer on.  If I shrink the size of the floor to 40&#39;x40&#39; all is well but if I increase the size to 80&#39;x80&#39; it malfunctions.  I tried creating an 80&#39;x80&#39; roof face, still malfunctions but a 40&#39;x40&#39; roof face works fine.  I tried an 80&#39;x80&#39; extrude, no luck but again 40&#39;x40&#39; works fine<br/>
<br/>
I put the large floor, now contained on layer &quot;corrupted floor&quot; on a new layer, added it to an existing layer and got the same malfunction.<br/>
<br/>
One last experiment, I turned off the texture and the problem went away.  So thinking I had a corrupt texture I imported a new texture from the VW library (Landscape Grass Dead RT) and I still get the problem.<br/>
<br/>
So the problem seems to be with a large textured object, not the object type, layer or specific texture

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
VW needs to show a progress message during first Redshift rendering of the session, similar to C4Ds.  On my Ventura I am seeing &quot;Rendering&quot; and time elapsed, it would be better to mention shader compilation may be happening during this first render.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the special message string could go away once rendering progress is &gt;0.

<br/>
This sort of texture is commonly used for CNC panels, wire meshes, screens, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This needs to be fixed so that Textures with Image Map transparency can be mapped with the Attribute Mapping Tool.

<br/>
When you go to Menu &quot;File ; Spotlight Preferences;Universes&quot;, you can change the Label<br/>
<br/>
of how each universe is displayed.<br/>
<br/>
 I used it before to help speed up some things.<br/>
<br/>
 Now if you edit a label you can change the name, but you can never change the<br/>
<br/>
first character of your new name again!<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
 Default is &quot;1&quot;, if I change to &quot;Univ. 1&quot; I can change every other character<br/>
<br/>
later, but the first letter &quot;U&quot;, so I can’t make it “1” again.<br/>
<br/>
 The solution is to delete that universe and re add, but still is not the<br/>
<br/>
desired behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Grüße<br/>

The worksheet function above is returning the wrong value.<br/>
<br/>
In a worksheet database consisting of scaled symbol, Object Variable, 101 should return the type of scaling, 0 for none, 1 for symmetric, 2 for asymmetric. Instead it is returning a very large positive or negative integer in the tens or hundreds of millions.<br/>
<br/>
Object Variable 102, 103 and 104 return the correct values for the X, Y, Z scale factors.<br/>
<br/>
The attached file contains three instances of a symbol. One unscaled, one symmetrically scaled, one asymmetrically scaled. It also has a worksheet showing the dimensions of each instance (assuming you are in an orthogonal view), the X, Y, and Z scale factors for each object, and the last column should show the scale type, but instead gives a very large number.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please fix the ObjectData(&#39;OBJECT VARIABLE&#39;, XXX) function to return the proper values for XXX=101 and all other selector options.

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
- Edit the Wall Style, then edit the Wall Closure at Inserts<br/>
- Change the Edit Edge option to &quot;Top&quot; or &quot;Bottom&quot;<br/>
- Change the Exterior Shape Type to &quot;Splay&quot; or &quot;Round&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that the preview image shows the correct location for the insert in 2022, but in 2023 the image seems to be shifted and the splayed/rounded edges show incorrectly (see attached screenshots).<br/>
<br/>
The actual closure geometry shows the same in both versions, so this only affects the dialog preview.<br/>
<br/>
This happens with the top, bottom, left, and right Edit Edge options.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to SP0.

I mirrored the shaft 2x4 walls to the other side of the building. I attempted to perform a capped join to the CMU wall.

The entire partition wall appears to join to the center component of the exterior wall even though that is not the core component. Then I tried editing the component joining and I get an error saying the walls are not yet joined. Video and file attached.

After dragged into the wall, the window&#39;s insert location is &quot;Wall-Centerline&quot; instead.<br/>
<br/>
My tests revealed that at the beginning of the RegenSink::RecalculateHandler() gSDK-&gt;GetWallInsertLocation() returned 7 (= Wall Closure - Insert Location) for both symbol definition and PIO (RegenSink.fhObject) which is correct. <br/>
<br/>
However, gSDK-&gt;GetObjectWallInsertMode(fhObject, wall, insertmode) returned insertion mode  0 (Wall-centerline).<br/>
<br/>
So it seems that Vectorworks assigned an incorrect insert mode to the symbol break.

I see the same thing in VW 2022 but not in VW 2021, so this might be related to Wall Modernization.

The file contains a Wall with Materials applied to its components, that use each of the different resource-based fill types (Hatch, Tile, Gradient, and Image).

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Note that the fill names show correctly at this point<br/>
-Now edit the &quot;Hatch Fill&quot; Material and change the Hatch<br/>
-Update the legend<br/>
<br/>
Note that the name updates as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now edit one of the other three Materials (Tile, Gradient, or Image)<br/>
-Again change the fill, then update the legend<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the fill name fails to update.<br/>
<br/>
This may have to do with the way the dynamic text is set up with multiple functions, so that it&#39;ll show a resource name regardless of the fill type.

As let know before (VE-102837) when the wall is below the story level the door is inserted at zero level and to place in the correct position must be moved manually.<br/>
So, as in one of attached images, I selected all the doors and then moved using Move by point tool. <br/>
Indeed, instead of moving the doors, was moved the walls. (see the other image):<br/>

Selecting and moving the doors one by one work as expected.

<br/>
the solution could be in two ways:<br/>
 * solve this bug as is (having the image stick to the Texture) *OR*<br/>
 * give scripters a proper functioncall to attach the image (IMO it could be the same as the SDK function *CreateImageFromPaint*) and make it eassier for scripters (and Marionnette users) to create a texture this way.<br/>
<br/>
Also the [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/72877-create-a-texture-resource-from-image-in-a-folder/] mentions this problem.

&quot;my file has been crashing regularly in the past few days, even though I&#39;m already editing complex symbols in a separate drawing. This morning it was so bad that not only did the program crash, but the entire PC was paralyzed and after a black screen the screens with all programs froze. What possibilities are there to be able to process the files again as quickly as possible without crashing and at a reasonable speed?&quot;

                                            <td class="description">      Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
yesterday I had a quite long call with a school.<br/>
They are using InteriorCAD and have about 80 licenses.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher, I had the call with, was complaining, that every single PC is not able to use Renderworks or Renderworks-Features (like working with textures).<br/>
The process itself pop-ups within the task-manager.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, I checked the path, the userfolder should be located at.<br/>
The path started with &quot;\\Server-Name\&quot;. This means, the Userprofile of each user is on a server and will be downloaded by logging in.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correct, there are a few Problems Vectorworks has, when the User folder is not located on the Computer directly (e.g. Not able to log into accounts at start up).<br/>
<br/>
To proof that this fact is leading into problems of using Renderworks, we created a new (local) Account on his computer with administrative permissions.<br/>
We started Vectorworks and Renderworks and Renderworks-Features were working perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to the conclusion, that Renderworks isn&#39;t working proper when the userfolder is not located locally.<br/>
<br/>
Because the user is using InteriorCAD, the Version he used was SP3.0.1-F3.<br/>
In the future, server based Userprofiles will increase in popularity; that&#39;s why I am reporting this, so you are aware of potential problems ins the future.<br/>
<br/>
Afaik Renderworks will be implemented into Vectorworks directly, right? Will this Circumstance still be relevant in 2023?<br/>
<br/>
And a side-effect I want to mention here: They were working with i7 10700 and nvidia geforce 1050ti, but the performance was very poor until we used the new created profile with local user profile (Means that server based user profiles could have an impact on performance).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Best<br/>
Alex<br/>

Notice the rendering gets stuck. One viewport shows a black fill.

As you can see in the enclosed movie the Point Cloud looks terrible when in Top Plan. I thought this difference visually might be for performance issues but zooming and panning seems unencumbered by the view, whether Top Plan or Top.<br/>
<br/>
I also enclose a .pts file. This file was the cause of a complaint by a user over the appearance of the Point Cloud when in Top Plan.<br/>
<br/>
I am using 2023 but it&#39;s the same in 2022. The Australian installer is still using this build.<br/>

this issue is maybe not really a bug. To my understanding the customer has drawn in an unfortunate way. Maybe there&#39;s a DWG-Import, but I see no class 0.<br/>
The main reason I send this file is the fact, that the customer has no way to repair this file.<br/>
I managed to repair this by deleting everything - resources, objects, classes. But that is not really a way I can advice the customer.<br/>
See video.<br/>
Go to sheet layer 01 [Grundriss], vieport Ansichtsbereich-6. Switch View from Top to Top/Plan. Result is that VP becomes really huge. Switch back to Top and it will stretch up to Alpha Centauri.<br/>
I could&#39;t find out, what causes this huge dimensions.<br/>
Workaround for the customer is to crop the viewports.<br/>
Nevertheless the document doesn&#39;t look healthy for me. Maybe you can find out something or tell me (which I said in the beginning) that the customer has drawn in a most unusual way and shouldn&#39;t do that.<br/>
Gruß, Klaus Lüttich

 # Open the Resource Manager. Notice it has an empty folder at the root level called &quot;Stuff&quot; which contains an empty folder called &quot;Shapes&quot;. It also has an empty folder at the top level called &quot;Things&quot;.<br/>
 # Navigate in the Resource Manager to the other file &quot;Folder Import Source.vwx&quot;. <br/>
 # Right click on the &quot;Shapes&quot; folder in the root of the Source file. Select Import to import that folder and all its contents (three symbols) to the &quot;Destination&quot; file. <br/>
 # In the &quot;Import Resource(s)&quot; Modal, choose &quot;Select Destination Folder&quot; and select the &quot;Things&quot; folder at the root.<br/>
 # Click Ok to execute the import.<br/>
<br/>
Expected: The symbols (and their parent folder) appear within the &quot;Things&quot; folder since it was the destination I selected.<br/>
<br/>
Actual: The symbols appear in the Stuff/Shapes folder because that folder was named the same thing as their parent folder in the &quot;Source&quot; file.<br/>
<br/>
I understand _why_ this is happening since we can&#39;t have two symbol folders in the same file with the same name. But it is pretty disorienting. In complex files, it is easy to forget I have s sub-folder buried somewhere else with the same name as a folder I am trying to import to a different location. I just spent a while on a real project trying to figure out why my import wasn&#39;t working when actually it was working, but it was just dumping the symbols in a subfolder I couldn&#39;t find.<br/>
<br/>
Some options of solutions to this:<br/>
 # I think the ideal solution would be for VW to start supporting multiple folders with the same name as long as they&#39;re at different paths. But maybe this is too big of a change.<br/>
 # The parent folder from Source gets renamed as &quot;Shapes (2)&quot; or something and placed in the &quot;Things&quot; folder as I intended.<br/>
 # The resources within the Shapes folder end up directly in &quot;Things&quot; and get stripped of their parent folder but at least I can find them.<br/>
<br/>
One way or another, I want these resources to end up in the folder I selected from the &quot;Import Resource(s)&quot; dialog.

<br/>
1)Open an attached file (&quot;12864.vwx&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
2)Switch the active layer to &quot;Sht-1&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
3)There are viewports created with each Rendering modes.<br/>
The upper outlines of Shaded, Final Quality Renderworks and Artistic Renderworks are breaking off.<br/>
We think the outlines are cut off because the upper space of the viewport crops are too small.<br/>
<br/>
*In wireframe and shaded polygon, it seems to look properly.<br/>
<br/>
*This issue occurs when creating a viewport without using any object as the crop.<br/>
<br/>
*The examples in the sample file are hemispheres, but the type of objects does not matter.<br/>

It is important to maintain the link with the story, so story bound objects keep their geometry and z-height.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Enter the Section In-Place mode for the viewport<br/>
- Activate any 2D drawing tool<br/>
<br/>
Note that &quot;Layer&quot; plane is active in the mode bar and can&#39;t be changed to &quot;Screen Aligned&quot;, so any 2D objects drawn in the current view will get placed on the Layer plane.<br/>
<br/>
- Now switch to any other 3D view<br/>
- Switch back to &quot;Viewport View&quot;<br/>
- Activate any 2D drawing tool again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the &quot;Screen Aligned&quot; plane gets activated and you can freely draw objects on the section plane.<br/>

Hi Vectorworks<br/>
<br/>
When I edit a texture by reference line, and the jpg from the texture is very big, VW crash.<br/>
<br/>
The same test in VW2021 is no problem. Video and jpg in the attachement.<br/>

<br/>
====== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION =========<br/>
<br/>
Steps differ between Doors and Windows each.<br/>
<br/>
Steps for Doors<br/>
<br/>
1) Place the Door with the Door tool.<br/>
<br/>
2) Click Settings on OIP.<br/>
<br/>
3) Click the &quot;Leaf&quot; from the left pane and choose &quot;Glass&quot; from the Leaf pull-down.<br/>
<br/>
4) Enter any value to the Vertical Bars and Horizontal Bars fields each. (Enter 1 each, for easy to see the problem, this time.)<br/>
<br/>
*Or, you can reproduce this problem if you enter values to the Vertical Bars and Horizontal Bars fields on the Muntins group in the &quot;Lights&quot; as well.<br/>
<br/>
5) Close the dialog with OK. And run the Shaded rendering.<br/>
 Then, unwanted lines show along the inner frame of the stile.<br/>
 It looks like the glass is interfering with the stiles.<br/>
<br/>
Steps for Windows<br/>
<br/>
1) Place the Window with the Window tool.<br/>
<br/>
2) Click Settings on OIP.<br/>
<br/>
3) Click the &quot;General&quot; from the left pane and choose &quot;Picture Window Slider&quot; from the &quot;Sash&quot; pull-down.<br/>
<br/>
4) Click the &quot;Muntins&quot; from the left pane and check &quot;Bottom sash&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5) Enter any value to the Vertical Bars and Horizontal Bars fields each. (Enter 1 each, for easy to see the problem, this time.)<br/>
<br/>
6) Enter 1 to the Bar Width field.<br/>
<br/>
7) Close the dialog with OK. And run the Shaded rendering.<br/>
 You can see unwanted lines on the inner frame just the same as doors.<br/>
<br/>
*Moving the view by the Flyover tool, you can see the problem easier so that the unwanted lines will move.<br/>
<br/>
*As long as I tried, I see this problem also Vectorworks 2021.<br/>
<br/>

a single dimension and a chain dimension have a different behavior with class opacity.<br/>
The class is set to have a fill opacity and not a pen opacity. E.g. fill opacity 30% and pen opacity 100%.<br/>
A single dimensions has opacity 100% like set in the class settings. A chain dimension has opacity 30% like the pen opacity is locked to the fill opacity.<br/>
Is that intended?<br/>
Guess it is a bug. Please fix that.<br/>

                Profile group lights behave differently between Shaded and Renderworks/Redshift
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I first reported in VB-158622, but starting new because the momentum on that seems to be lost and now Shaded and Redshift are in the mix.<br/>
<br/>
The attached file contains two Marionette PIO&#39;s. Both have render lights in their profile group (the Marionette definition). The one on the right also has a render light in the geometry, which duplicates the light in the profile group.<br/>
<br/>
Note, profile groups are the method we have for having a light in the PIO appear in the visualization palette. It also has the benefit of any user-overrides preserving between generations.<br/>
<br/>
In Shaded, the profile group light does not render. The object MUST duplicate the light into the geometry if it&#39;s to support Shaded rendering.<br/>
<br/>
In both Renderworks and Redshift, the light renders directly from the profile group. I believe that the Shaded behavior is a bug, for the following reasons:<br/>
1. Duplicating the light into the object geometry means that the light is twice as bright in RW/RS than in Shaded renders<br/>
2. Having the light render from the profile group means that it responds to viewport lighting overrides with no additional coding. The light in the geometry does not respond to overrides.<br/>
3. In addition to the VP overrides, synchronizing the light between the profile group and the object requires more code and thus more opportunity for bugs and inconsistencies. For VW objects, this affects (at least) the Helicon and the Lighting Device. Replicating the RW/RS behavior in Shaded means the light&#39;s appearance is handled by the core. (To wit, I once asked how the Lighting Device accomplished VP overrides, and was told it&#39;s so convoluted and inefficient I don&#39;t want to try it).<br/>

                When creating a Wall End Cap in a layer that enabled cut plane opition, a part of its line shows even though the wall height is lower than cut plane height.

<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce.<br/>
<br/>
1) Create 2 walls. Create one wall with 900 height and another one with 1100 height. Create one wall with a height of 900 and the other with a height of 1100.<br/>
<br/>
2) Select the two walls, Select &quot;Replace&quot; from &quot;Style&quot; drop-down list on OIP., and select any style.<br/>
(For exmple : _Imperial Story Bounded Walls.vwx&gt;Int Wall-2x4-Gyp Bd 5/8in)<br/>
<br/>
3) Select &quot;Components...&quot; of OIP, select all the components in the &quot;Wall Components&quot; dialog, and click &quot;Edit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
4) Set to &quot;Relative to wall&quot; for both &quot;Component Top&quot; and &quot;Component Bottom&quot; and close all dialogs.<br/>
<br/>
5) Select the &quot;Wall End Cap&quot; tool and create Wall End Caps for both walls.<br/>
(Create a End Cap in wall for the another it as well as.)<br/>
<br/>
6) Go to Tools &gt; Organization &gt; Design Layer Tab. Then select &quot;Design Layer-1&quot; and click Edit.<br/>
<br/>
7) Enable &quot;Enable Cut Plane at Layer Elevation&quot; and make sure the value in the field is &quot;1000&quot;. Then click OK.<br/>
<br/>
8) Check the 900 height wall. An unwanted line shows between the edge of the wall end cap and the wall.<br/>
<br/>
We think this line is supposed to be invisible, because the wall height is lower than the cut plane height.<br/>
<br/>
*As long as I tried, I see this problem also Vectorworks 2021 and Vectorworks 2020.<br/>

<br/>
In this case, the transparency shader also contains the same image, producing unpredictable results.<br/>
<br/>
I could see using the transparency shader to support legacy textures that may not have an color shader, however, Vectorworks should only look at the transparency shader if the color shader is not present.

Turing off distance falloff makes them more comparable.<br/>

Using an emitter does not improve the discrepancy. One would expect that when using an emitter, Renderworks and Redshift renders should have similar brightnesses.

Now I&#39;ve noticed a specific object (a Railing/Fence object) that seems to make this a lot more reproducible, so I was able to at least record the issue happening. Open the attached file, switch the &quot;Shaded&quot; render mode and just zoom in/out/around the object.<br/>

<br/>
I have a user having crashes since updating to Windows 11. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there is an error message stating &quot;GPU problem was detected&quot; when launching Vectorworks but it still works however, only on 2d view. When this happens accessing the Nvidia Control Panel will retrieve an error message stating the is &quot;no Nvidia GPU connected to the machine&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Drivers and Vectorworks are up to date. <br/>
<br/>
There are two GPUs. An intel iris and an Nvidia MX230. The selection of High Performance is set in the Windows Graphic Settings and when Nvidia allows being open, it allows to show the high-performance GPU for Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
I have referred the user to Nvidia but their support refers the user back to us stating everything is fine with them. <br/>
<br/>
Usually restarting sorts this problem. But sometimes not. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m almost sure this is an Nvidia or Dell or Windows 11 problem, but can you guys confirm this? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The default 3D render mode doesn&#39;t function as expected when entering and exiting a group following the next steps:<br/>
- enter the group from a top/plan view<br/>
- Go to a 3d view inside that group (shaded is applied)<br/>
- exit the group.<br/>
<br/>
You are still in a 3D view now, but the render mode did switch unexpectedly to &quot;wire frame&quot;. Possibly this comes from the fact that a top/ plan view is in wire frame by default, so the render mode &quot;returns&quot; to wire frame when you exit the group. Following that logic, it technically makes some sense, but for the user this feels inconsistent.

<br/>
One of our clients sends us this message:<br/>
<br/>
At Variofields (company) we run a Microsoft Sharepoint environment.<br/>
Vectorworks projects are saved in this sharepoint environment.<br/>
<br/>
Now we noticed that some files were missing after saving.<br/>
The reason for this is that Vectorworks writes a large number of Mesh files (probably while working on the project). This amounts to 30,000-40,000 files.<br/>
<br/>
Onedrive cannot write so many files so quickly.<br/>
My question now is, do you have multiple customer cases where people use Vectorworks in combination with. with Onedrive and Sharepoint?<br/>
<br/>
For now, I&#39;ve set the user to write all files from Vectorworks to the local desktop.<br/>
<br/>
This issue occurs when they export to FBX. Vectorworks file (including the auto save) and export are one the Onedrive/sharepoint.<br/>
If this helps: they don&#39;t use projectsharing<br/>
<br/>
I forwarded this question multiple times to Tech Support but I didn&#39;t receive an answer. <br/>
<br/>
Can someone give more information about this?

I assume this is due to the adjacent coplanar edge of the object to the right, which happens to stick out further than the surface I&#39;m trying to work on. However, a user would expect this corner that I&#39;m near to be an available snap point.<br/>
<br/>
This is an issue in Shaded render when using Automatic Plane in orthographic views. If I switch to wireframe I&#39;m able to snap to the corner of the object as expected. But it should also work in Shaded mode.

                Incorrect texture mapping for grass shader
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      ncorrect texture mapping for objects uses grass texture. Wrong texture is made from Grass Shader with image chosen eg. [TE]Trawnik.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Problem is more visible If you use higher geometry quality in render style preferences or bigger texture scale in OIP. Texture for testing should be created from Grass Shader with image chosen.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are a few factors, which have to be present at the same moment, to make this bug visible:<br/>
<br/>
- the base shape must be an irregular (extruded) polyline, circle etc. (for rectangles it works fine)<br/>
- the rendering mode must be different than Shaded (for Shaded it works fine)<br/>
- the Renderworks texture must be [TE] Trawnik <br/>
- The Color Shader must be Grass<br/>
- Grass Shader must have a image of grass available<br/>
<br/>
Some remarks<br/>
The grass image seems to cause a problem. Why?<br/>
1. When you delete this image from the Edit Grass Shader dialog, the problem won&#39;t occur.<br/>
2. When you use a preview rendering style (e.g. [RS] Exterieur Snel), the problem won&#39;t occur either, because this style doesn&#39;t use shader image for rendering.<br/>
3. When you use a final rendering style (e.g. [RS] Exterieur Finaal), the problem WILL occur, which migth prove the Robert&#39;s hypothesis...<br/>
<br/>
To really see this problem, you must increase the scale of this texture (in the OIP) significantly or zoom in a lot.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 it looks fine to me (scale = 50, the same texture is used, with a Grass Shader and Shader Image of Grass, Rendering Style = Exterior Final)<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the problem is in the texture but we don&#39;t know why. Can you take a look at it?<br/>

                Font Mapping does not preserve applied style of font variant
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The initial problem here is found when bringing a file with styled fonts from Mac to Windows. (TBD, also see if a parallel issue exists in the other direction).<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # On Mac, create a Vectorworks file with a text object.<br/>
 # Set the font of the text object to Helvetica Neue Bold‡, and save.<br/>
 # Transfer the fonts to a Windows PC.<br/>
 # In Vectorworks, open the font, and you should get a font substitution dialog‡‡<br/>
 # Attempt to map the font to Arial Bold<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: since there is no &#39;Arial Bold&#39; listed in the substitution drop-down, you can pick &#39;Arial&#39; and the mapping will automatically apply Bold<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: when you map to Arial, the bold quality of the original font is lost; hence, there is no way to establish a mapping from Helvetica Neue Bold to Arial Bold.<br/>
<br/>
‡Note, this is the actual font named &quot;Helvetica Neue Bold&quot;, _not_ a regular Helvetica Neue typeface with the Bold checkbox applied.<br/>
<br/>
‡‡If you do not get a dialog, the computer may already have a font mapping in place for this font; delete local app data/prefs, and/or use a different font, so long as it is a Mac font not available on Windows and you choose a &#39;Bold&#39; font variant.<br/>
<br/>
*Font system difference detail*: this issue partly stems from different OS font handling and presentation. On both Mac and Windows, there actually _are_ separate font family variants for Arial and Arial Bold. On Mac these are shown as separately selectable fonts in System font menus (sim. for Helvetica Neue and Helvetica Neue Bold, etc.), while Windows font menus tend to only show &quot;Arial&quot;. Since we know this, our code should be more intelligent about mappings such as this; if we are mapping a bold variant of a font to a Windows typeface (Arial) which also has a bold variant, we should automatically map to the similarly-styled variant. Or, we should provide a custom font menu that permits a specific variant (like Arial Bold) to be selected on Windows.

<br/>
Running Purge on Working file said operation could not be completed due to &quot;Design Layer-1&quot; being checked out by Walid.  However, going to File&gt;Project Sharing and under the Layer tab, Design Layer-1 did not show as being checked out.  Also tried checking out Design Layer-1, and still showed as being check out by Walid (see attached video).<br/>
<br/>
Reached out to POD group to verify what they also got the notification that Design Layer-1 was checked out by Walid without it should in the Project Sharing window.  <br/>
<br/>
Walid said: Using a different computer than he normally uses for our PS testing (Windows laptop from hardware testing VWTester account, so not Admin?) he had deleted Design Layer-1 yesterday, then followed with commit and release. <br/>
<br/>
Walid was required to do an Admin Release of the layer in order to resolve the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Just surprised this didn&#39;t show in the Project Sharing Layer list.  There was also a viewport checked out to Greg (that was actually checked out to Greg still), but was also not showing in the Project Sharing window as well.  This is not seen in the video since he was able to release the object.<br/>

Copies of Project Sharing and vwx files attached.<br/>

<br/>
Attached are two Vectorworks files, both files have the exact same objects, the only difference being that one file has all objects in a 2D Symbol and the other file has all objects in a 3D Symbol.<br/>
<br/>
In both files we execute the same action, select the symbol in the drawing (2D or 3D, depending on the file) and convert the Symbol to Group.<br/>
<br/>
With the 3D Symbol all objects remain in place.<br/>
<br/>
With the 2D Symbol objects shift place. More precisely, inside of the main symbol, there are other sub symbols which in turn have polylines and polygons. What I&#39;ve noticed is that the &quot;sub symbols&quot; when being converted to Group switch from their original place.

<br/>
In the enclosed file go to a design layer, make the layer options set to Show/Snap and render in Shaded mode. <br/>
<br/>
In the macOS 12.5.1 and Windows 10 everything is ok. However the user has Windows 11 which we do not have yet. This is the only thing I can suggest is the problem, apart from the actual GPU card in that as you can see from the comparison screenshots between 2022 and 2023 that Draw Edges, Textures and Crease Angle are unavailable in the Shaded options and thus the render if different to 2022.<br/>
<br/>
I also enclose the DxDiag file. Please note that although the driver is dated July he has since installed the latest one from August with the same result.<br/>

It gets stuck on the first frame. The resulting movie is incorrect. See &#39;Test25&#39; attched below. <br/>
<br/>
-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
-Create movie with these settings:<br/>
<br/>
Duration: 3 secs<br/>
<br/>
Render mode: Redshift Exterior Final (default settings)<br/>
<br/>
Quality: Very high<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve attached two screen shots showing two different times with the same scene showing. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note:<br/>
<br/>
After the movie was created, I noticed it was not created properly. The movie contains only the first frame? Not sure how this happened since it took 50 min for the movie to generate. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I did a quick test in &#39;Shaded&quot; and that worked as expected. See movie &#39;Test 26&#39; attached.

                Resource Manager: Previews + inconsistent VGM and other behaviour when detail levels of Spotlight and truss and other geometry set to low.

                                            <td class="description">      Hello,<br/>
In the enclosed file and movie you will see some truss symbols placed as truss objects. The symbols have been edited with the Generic Solids have only the &#39;Low&#39; level of detail settings checked in the OIP. The Magnets and simple extrude around the geometry are left as they are by default to have Low, Medium and High levels checked.<br/>
<br/>
This was done because of trying to work out this insufferable problem of the 3D previews in the RM not showing the truss geometry - rather it shows when rendered Shaded or HLR to show the simple extrude, thereby obscuring the geometry. This comes from the following VE I have done:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VE-100654<br/>
Spotlight Truss libraries have to have rendered thumbs and previews without simplified box obscuring<br/>
https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-100654?jql=text%20~%20preview%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC<br/>
<br/>
However when viewed sometimes you only see the truss &#39;connector crosses&#39; which are always visible. It seems that it might be a VGM issue because in some instances they do not show.<br/>
<br/>
If the document preference &#39;Auto display detail levels for design layers &#39; is checked sometime they appear yet others not. I do not think this is because I have the scale of the design layer incorrectly checked.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is that the RM preview should only show details that are set to Low, yet in wireframe it is blank. Also the actual thumbnails don&#39;t show. I&#39;m not being very clear here and apologies about the rambling movie but it seems this is not just a VE but now a VB when these settings are changed the previews and thumbnail are are wrong or don&#39;t show at all.<br/>

                Hidden Line Render (HLR) for Surface hatches inconsistent on certain solids

In the enclosed file there is a WW2 Nissan hut being modelled for a TV drama. The material is corrugated sheets of iron. Typically the groover run vertically.<br/>
This report is about how the repetitions of the Surface hatch when in HLR do not match up and make continuous grooves.<br/>
Also that if changed to running horizontally it is not a case of simply changing the texture&#39;s rotation in the OIP, but that the mapping of the element also has to be involved, sometimes to Surface UV sometimes to Auto Align. Sometimes the rotation has to be 90º other times 0º.<br/>
Then when looking at how these work when looking at the grooves in a Shaded render often the HLR and the Shaded render -Architect- are 90º to each other when they should be the same.<br/>
If all objects behaved the same then users could work out the logic, but alas not all do perform the same. This report is to highlight this as a bug as the rendering appears inconsistent when using Surface Hatches in HLR on curved solids.<br/>

I was making a video to report a Spotlight bug but as you can see from this enclosed video the graphic problems I was having are terrible. I enclose the Vectorworks file but as it hadn&#39;t been saved at the time of the video I don&#39;t think it is that (and it was a blank one anyway). <br/>
<br/>
I turned off &#39;Accelerate Graphics&#39; but it didn&#39;t make a difference. Braceworks snapping didn&#39;t work, Fit to Objects didn&#39;t, Multi Views didn&#39;t. Maybe they did but the screen didn&#39;t show as if they were. The video cuts off at the point I show the Spotlight bug which is in another report.<br/>

To reproduce, in the OIP, set the Symbols to be scaled symmetrically using any scale factor.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the by-face textures fail to show in all render modes.<br/>
<br/>
By comparison, if you scale the same objects manually (outside of a Symbol) the by-face textures remain applied.<br/>
<br/>
I see the same problem going back to 2022 SP1, but if I try it in SP0 this was working fine to some degree. So it looks like there may have been an SP1 change that caused a regression.

When entering Japanese text on Mac OS 12.6 with typical settings, hitting *esc* will not end editing. Also, one has to hit *enter* twice to end editing.<br/>
<br/>
The situation is somewhat worse on Ventura with default settings (which do not show a drop-down of candidate glyphs for Japanese input) - here, *enter* will not end editing, it will instead change the existing text. *esc* also does not end editing. (In my testing I&#39;ve actually gotten in the habit of switching back to US input just so I can hit esc/enter reliably to end editing).<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: even in non-Latin/alpabetic text input modes, *esc* and *enter* still behave the same way with regard to our text objects in edit mode - they both exit out of edit mode in the current text object.

I don&#39;t think that there is a list of reproducing steps that will always trigger this DSTOP, but I generally can get this DSTOP to trigger after setting a style, reverting to unstyled, and then changing settings on the OIP Shape pane until it triggers.<br/>
<br/>
See the attached video and the attached screenshot for a reproduced DSTOP and the location in the code where a bad cast is occurring.

                EJKerr DSTOP Duplicate! - spurious assert on resource import
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This issue is with the DSTOP statement at DocumentColors.cpp:2258, I&#39;m filing this for discussion for [~ejkerr] since I&#39;m not sure of the full scope or intention.<br/>
<br/>
This DSTOP on duplicate color gets triggered every time for a basic texture resource input in a new document. To reproduce from a debug build:<br/>
 # Create a new, empty document<br/>
 # Open Resource Manager to Vectorworks Libraries/Visualization/Materials/zNested Textures<br/>
 # Right-click and choose *Import* on one of the textures<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the texture gets imported without any asserts<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the DSTOP at the source line mentioned is triggered. The call stack shows that this AddColorToCaches() call comes via TDocumentColors::SetUp() ultimately from CResourceContent::ImportResourceItems(). I&#39;m not following exactly what&#39;s being attempted but I think the existence of the color record is actually expected here (it happens every time on resource import).<br/>
<br/>
I think probably the correct fix is to remove the DSTOP but I&#39;m not certain about the surrounding logic and context.

3) select the object<br/>

5) pick the outer edge of the object<br/>

When bending less than the full 180°, the object stays solid.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you will get an error message &quot;Deform failed.&quot; I&#39;m not exactly sure why. It may have to do with the point you click on in 4).

I can see two ways of improving this:<br/>

<br/>
In the HL render, note that it shows an extra, random line (see attached screenshot).<br/>
<br/>
If you enter the Elevation In-Place mode so that it shows the VGM HL render, the line doesn&#39;t show.<br/>
<br/>
If you simplify the Polygon so that it has a few less vertices, the problem will go away.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in past versions.

In this file, if you change the roll angle it sends some of the pieces off from the rest of the position. If you try and change the roll angle again, all of the 2D and 4D geometry disappear. I found that if I copy the hanging position and paste it into a new document, I can change the roll angle like normal. However, if I try and do the same thing and include the attached lighting devices, it breaks again in the new blank file.

 * Environment lighing<br/>
 * Environment reflections<br/>
 * Object reflections<br/>

will be activated for every new document in 2023. But when I test it in 2023 SP0 it isn&#39;t. Is this mend to be or is this a bug?<br/>

The same for the option &#39;Limit Shaded render mode to 8 lights&#39;. It&#39;s not standard activated for new documents in 2023 but it&#39;s mentioned in the video.

<br/>
Initial situation: Image effect edited by Image Fill in Accessory Manager. (In the example file &quot;Beton-Schalung Holz 02 BF&quot;).<br/>
Goal: Facade design with concrete image fill -&gt; Export as PDF.<br/>
Problem: Image effect not visible after export PDF. Only if PDF is exported rasterized.<br/>
<br/>
Cause:<br/>
As soon as the texture is scaled with &quot;Edit Fill and Texture&quot; so that the image starts to repeat once, the image effects are deactivated<br/>
<br/>
Feature: Only if the texture is scaled with this tool, the effect occurs. If a large rectangle is drawn and the texture is applied so that it repeats without texture scaling, the image fill is exported correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings <br/>
<br/>

Note that the Hatch fills show fine in the Viewports, but are the wrong size in the legend (see attached screenshots). This seems to happen regardless of the legend&#39;s scale.<br/>

Prior to the fix for VB-188417 the Hatches showed the right size, so this looks like it was caused by that change (changelist 664417).

                Windows - paste of styled text can produce badly formatted separate text objects
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      UPDATE: after encountering again in acceptance testing I&#39;m updating this bug with new fixtures. Pasting a particular document&#39;s text in while not in edit mode result in very badly formatted results. I&#39;m adding screenshots of the source document selection in MS word and the result of pasting into Vectorworks. Also adding the source MS Word document and the resulting .vwx file (from VW28 b6). I think this result is so bad that the customer would think the product had a serious flaw; it may depend somewhat on the source styled text.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Some odd behavior happens when pasting in styled text on Windows in certain active-tool scenarios. The behavior does not happen on Mac, nor with all types of styled text clipboard content.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t an acceptance test blocker, I&#39;m fairly sure this is not new and it seems low priority.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a new Vectorworks document<br/>
 # Open the sample-source-text.rtf document in WordPad.exe<br/>
 # Select and copy all the text in WordPad<br/>
 # In Vectorworks, create a new text object with insertion cursor and paste - note that the text all comes in and some style info is saved (though it does lose a little formatting)<br/>
 # Now end editing and activate another tool - selection should work, or rectangle, etc.<br/>
 # Paste<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the paste creates a new text object, with the copied styled text content<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the paste creates multiple text objects, each individually styled. While in some ways it looks okay there are some very strange things including the font size (which is much smaller, e.g. 8.3 pt or so). <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is in some way intentional in the Windows-specific clipboard handling code or text system, but it seems to be a bug to me because 1) it does not behave the same on both OS&#39;s and 2) I don&#39;t think the Windows behavior is standard even on windows - I think when a customer copies and pastes a whole passage of text, they want a single text object, and something like a normal size for the text.<br/>

The 2D graphics in this file are rather complex: a lot of layers of gradients and high- resolution images on top of eachother, lots of transparancies. It doesn&#39;t seem to be sufficient to just lower the resolution of some images of get rids of a few transparent layers, you seem to need to strip down the whole dawing to 1 non transparent layer in order to be able to output this drawing in a normal way.<br/>
<br/>
Lately we seem to see a rise in issues with outputting drawings with a lot of images and transparancy, especially when they&#39;re embedded in tile fills. I don&#39;t know this is because there&#39;s a flaw in VW 2022 or because users are creating more and more complex graphics.<br/>

in order to upgrade their license file to Vw 2022 or to shift the SPS to a different machine or in order to update the SPS. When this is done, the license file appears to have been deleted and no longer appears in the SPS &gt; License menu: !https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/threads/392273000035277012/inlineImages/edbsnf08ac8c3f0117feb562b991b9fd5a81af2ba6414760d9e4e772a8ae3f7bb10ee8754c87db7f42a9fda2e9f9c788528b77ccf50367da22be511c9d2337964a74cd5b1484e87d9da89e6022bae74fff91c?et=1805616c220&amp;ha=5a1eee50395291aa45a8efbd6604fdad816c2d35da5909c29ba4e9f32e6aea17&amp;f=1.png|width=508,height=320!<br/>
<br/>
however when their activation key is entered on the new machine or again on the existing machine, they get this message:<br/>

!https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/threads/392273000035239827/inlineImages/edbsn7627825b0505401f2791693377a3d5b457c756099bc711e3d5cafc884e864a63bb8a791b24201e4abc0e1fdfd12fe2d7dd10102612feb4a3f6a93a16561b7499bfe1f7165e9cb017d4734ddabf0ab51e?et=1805619a6c3&amp;ha=e9f01b40a1f33897fa1e6342a185375abdfaf710468ec719e47d566a670775ab&amp;f=2.jpg|width=432,height=129!<br/>
<br/>
The only resolution is to create a new activation key on Partner Services web site and while this is easy enough, it is inconvenient for users because they can not operate Vectorworks until the issue is resolved.<br/>
<br/>
In case it helps, in the most recent case the activation key that was revoked was: AC1-XK85PT-ZC-413703. I will be generating a new one in the morning.<br/>

Does it start when the rendering runs on VCS? or when a file is being started uploading to VCS?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Referring to the VCS help, there are the descriptions in each paragraphs below.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
 -Preparing .vwx files for processing in the cloud<br/>
&quot;If your sheets have complicated geometry and or rendering details, consider making adjustments to keep within the 24-hour rendering time limit.&quot;<br/>
 -What causes a cloud processing job to time out?<br/>
&quot;If a job is not complete within 24 hours, it times out.&quot;<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
As long as we tested as we uploaded a file to VCS, it looks like the 24-hours limit countdown starts when the file status turned to &quot;Queued...&quot; .<br/>
(See the movie [Vectorworks Cloud Service Test.mov] I attached.)<br/>
<br/>
Time index for the movie<br/>
0:55 : Published to the VCS folder.<br/>
1:58 : &quot;Pending&quot; status turned to &quot;Queued...&quot;.<br/>
2:14 : Checked the duration time on the VCS desktop app.<br/>
It&#39;s already 16 seconds at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you have any information.<br/>

<br/>
1. Export to PDF the Sheet Layer 594_05-013, with the Viewport Ansichtsbereich-5 having a rotation of -172,27 degrees. <br/>
<br/>
Result: Some objects will be missing from the Viewport (see with rotation.pdf export result).<br/>
<br/>
2. Now switch the rotation of the Viewport to zero and export it again to PDF. All objects will be displayed (see no rotation.pdf export result).<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this and try to find what is causing the objects to disappear when there is a Viewport rotation and hopefully solve the problem. Thank you in advance.

    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      One of the aspects that hasn&#39;t yet been cleanly solved with the deprecation of screen plane is trying to draw a crop object prior to creating a viewport. In VW2021 and earlier, you&#39;d simply make sure the plane dropdown was set to Screen Plane, then draw then crop, the create the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
In VW2022, the intended workflow is to first click the &quot;Align Working Plane with Current View&quot; button, then draw the crop geometry, then create the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
This works okay in orthogonal projection, but in Perspective projection this often fails, because the geometry is anchored on the document origin (I think?) which is often offscreen.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to capture an example of this in the attached screen recording. Note that after I draw the rectangle I have to move backwards in space (I&#39;m using a 3D mouse) in order to see the rectangle. Clearly this doesn&#39;t work for creating crop geometry.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t yet found a way to make this work reliably in Perspective. The only workaround as far as I can tell is to just make an uncropped viewport of the entire screen, then add the crop afterwards to the sheet layer viewport.

<br/>
If you rename a class and you have worksheets which use the class as filter, the worksheets doesn&#39;t work anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Just rename the class &quot;redd&quot; in the attached file and update the worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Marc

2. Lock Profile Plane and Fix Profile are selected.<br/>
2.1. Click OK.<br/>
<br/>
Result: We can see that the object isn&#39;t correctly displayed after the first curve. Its shape is distorted to something undesired.<br/>
<br/>
3. With the object selected, go to the OI and deactivate the option &quot;Lock Profile Plane&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Result: Now the object seems to be correct, but because the profile plane isn&#39;t locked, the opening that is wanted to remain on the bottom part of the object does not anymore. We can see it twists through the object, ending sideways instead of the wished bottom position.

<br/>
The round windows in the attached file leads to a wrong horizontal section on the sheet layer &quot;100&quot;.In the section, the 3D representation is still visible in addition to the 2D representation. This is due to the fact that in the horizontal section the 2D representation is not 100% above the 3D geometry and, depending on the cutting height, parts of the round window geometry show through.<br/>
<br/>

Background rendering of that interior elevation viewport is hidden line. Any other rendering like dashed hidden line also make those pillows visible. So it seems to be an issue with background rendering.<br/>

If the Slab is not Auto-Bounded to the Wall + I instead edit the top offsets of the relevant Wall components manually, the components will merge as they should, without any lines missing.&quot;<br/>

1) Draw a Rectangle in the Top/Plan view and set Fill Style to Hatch from Attributes Pallete.<br/>
2) With Rectangle selected, execute AEC menu&gt; Create Auto Hybrid.<br/>
3) Rectangle changes to Auto Hybrid and Hatch disappears. <br/>

<br/>
When walls are drawn with extrusion objects below section cut plane are not visible in a section viewport when objects below section plane are rendered in hidden line mode.<br/>
<br/>
See attached file for examples<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
Draw a retangle 4000x4000. Offset retangle by 150. Clip surface. Extrude clipped polyine 3000 mm. draw some objects or symbols within the extruded (walls) polyline. Make a section viewport with a cut on 2 meters. all objects below the 2m section are not visible in the section viewport with following settings.<br/>
&#39;display extents below cut plane&#39; settings:<br/>
Background render: hiddenline render<br/>
<br/>
Additional information:<br/>
<br/>
Backgroundrender: shaded settings show objects below cutplane<br/>
<br/>
When extrusion is replaced by wall. All objects become visible again.<br/>
<br/>
Making an opening in the extrusion alos fixes the problem.<br/>

I guess you already know about this, that you cannot snap on hidden objects in a SLSVP rendered by Renderworks. With other Renderers like Shaded it works.<br/>
It also work in a SLVP with front view.<br/>
So it is the combination of Section Viewport and Renderworks.<br/>
See Video and testfile.

In the file there is a Section Viewport of a Wall and a Window.<br/>

With Hidden Line and &quot;Display 2D components&quot; active, we can see that a few lines are being displayed that shouldn&#39;t. If we deactivate &quot;Displayed 2D components&quot; then its displayed as expected with Hidden Line.<br/>
<br/>
If we double click the Section Viewport and go to Section In-Place, we can see that Wireframe, Hidden Line and Dashed Hidden Line has the same representation. While Wireframe is correct, the others two are not.

<br/>
Example:<br/>
<br/>
Viewport 1/L E3 <br/>
- Before Update VW is using a bit more than 4 GB (with the file open).<br/>
- While Updating peaks to a bit above 24 GB. The update lasts close to 5 minutes.<br/>
- Slowly decreases to 18,74 GB but never to the value before performing the update.<br/>
<br/>
The other Viewports are as problematic in terms of memory used and time needed to update.<br/>
<br/>
Note: We can also see that the Viewports are not visible when the file is opened (this happens with 2022 SP3 beta 628500, but not with 2022 SP2.1 R1). The performance problems also happen with SP2.1.

<br/>
When you update the SLSVP you will receive a result of the Section and a Data Visualization. If you close and reopen the file, the Data Visualization is no longer visible. You have to update the Section.<br/>
<br/>
The customer Importance is &quot;High&quot; because the customer has a lot of SLSVP in his file. The attached file is just a Sample file from me.<br/>

<br/>
The file contains a Window object with custom graphics in its Front 2D Component, along with a few Hidden Line viewports (Section and elevation) that have &quot;Display 2D Fills&quot; enabled.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, note that the 2D graphics show correctly in the Section Viewports, but in the elevation Viewports it looks like there&#39;s some kind of stacking order issue that&#39;s causing fills not to show.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2022 SP0. This also happens in Mainline.

<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
First i do this in VW 2021 I draw a roof with a window in it. Then i make a horizontal section viewport through the roof and the window. In my viewport i go to the objects above the section line, in the list I choose the class 27 daken, because my roof is in this class. Here i give in the graphical settings and update my viewport. I get exactly what I expect.<br/>
<br/>
I save this drawing and open it in a version 2022, i update my viewport and al the objects above my section line becomes equal black.<br/>
<br/>
How ik can solved it to become that same result as in 2021 is:<br/>
<br/>
1. Make a copy of the viewport.<br/>
2. In the original viewport unmark the settings of the objects above the section line<br/>
3. in the copy of the viewport unmark to view te object under the section line.<br/>
4. Select the whole roof and place it from class 27 daken to the class 47 dakafwerkingen-bedekking-leien<br/>
5. set all the other classes which are part of the roof on invisible<br/>
6. Make the settings above the objects in the class 47 dakafwerkingen-bedekking-leien<br/>
7. Update the viewport and you get the right settings of the roof<br/>
8. Now you have to find in which class al the parts of the window are in so you can also set these graphical settings in this class.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a good workflow customers can not use the graphical settings on this way?<br/>

<br/>
- The login screen, which pops up at first lauch, renders white. Because of this the customer theoretiacally cannot start drawing in this version. I found a hack to resolve this for him, by creating a file &quot;First Time Run&quot; with value &quot;0&quot; in the registration folder in the registy. because of the presence of this file (which I see on computers where the log in succeded) Vectorworks seems to skip the log in screen. However the customer has to possibility now to work in Vectorworks 2022, he stil cannot login, so he misses out on the service select libraries.<br/>
<br/>
- Another issue for this customer: he cannot use Renderworks. Whenever he tries to apply a texture or choose a renderworks rendering, all renderworks functionalities seem to disappear from his workspace. I tried already the next things:<br/>
- Re- install windows redistributables<br/>
- Update graphics card<br/>
- Disable security software<br/>
- Download Re- install Vectroworks while all security software is disabled<br/>
- Delete as much bloatware as possible from his computer<br/>
- End non- essential processes in the task manager<br/>
- After the advice of thech support, I tried to start &quot;cineware.exe with a double click, but no error showed up<br/>
None of these worked<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these two issues are completely unrelated, but can it be:<br/>
- That the same issue is creating these two problems?<br/>
- That the Renderworks- issue is provoked by my improvised<br/>
<br/>
I added the properties of the computer in the attatchment.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you can that might solve this issue?<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks 2021 works fine on this computer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for taking a look.

<br/>
We do not have any computers with Sierra to test and search for possible solutions, hence we ask for help with this.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any known problem with VW2021 Renderworks and Sierra? Is there any idea what could be causing this or what should we check in the Customer computer to possibly fix this problem?<br/>

Thank you in advance.

this is more like a question than a bugreport. Customer has asked question I regretfully cannot answer.<br/>
<br/>
In Vectorworks 2021 there was a message bar at the bottom. Now in 2022 it is the status bar.<br/>
That message bar in 2021 displayed x, y, z, x&#39;, y&#39;, z&#39;, while the status bar only shows x, y, z. Why? Why taking away functionality from the customer? Or has it been placed somewhere else? I couldn&#39;t find anything.<br/>
<br/>
The z in 2021 showed the current height from objects plus the layer height. In 2022 it seems to be the layer height only. Why? Maybe it was a bug before 2022? Or due to a wish or change of concept?<br/>
<br/>
Of course I could answer the customer a nice story, but I personally like to know what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and regards, Klaus Lüttich

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the attached file (and accompanying video), during the update of a single section viewport update, all section viewports in the drawing become &#39;dirty&#39; and report as needing update, even though they were previous in an Updated state. No modifications have been made to the model, this is something that is being triggered by the viewport update process alone and I don&#39;t think should be happening.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The video shows the testing process and the point at which the failure occurred. I could repeat  the issue, and got it to happen on a number of occasions, although not all the time, but it did seem to happen more when updating the viewports numbered 21315-13 or 21316-17. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The file supplied has all the section viewports in a dirty state. Some should be updated, before trying those viewport numbers listed above. In my testing, the prior viewports had been updated individually.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the video, you&#39;ll see the individual update process that I went through (this simulates how users often work).<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to 1m30s - you&#39;ll see that viewport 21315-13 is being updated - and at 2.35 you&#39;ll see at the exact moment that the viewport goes into background calculation mode, the earlier updated viewports all switch to registering as dirty.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Although I first saw this while testing 2022, I have also had one experience of the same thing happening on the same file and the same viewport in 2022 SP3.

(Page 6, 5th line.)<br/>
<br/>
But the direct link seems to be not stopped automatically, as long as we checked with entering into a symbol object.<br/>
We checked this behavior with the steps below. <br/>
We would like to ask you that our way was suitable to check or not.<br/>
Please let us know if it&#39;s incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
The steps.<br/>
<br/>
1)Open an attached file.(0314-1.vwx)<br/>
<br/>
2)Select the Datasmith Direct Link tool.<br/>
<br/>
3)Click &quot;Direct Link Auto Sync &quot; mode on the tool bar.<br/>
<br/>
4)Select a symbol and double-click or select &quot;Edit 2D Components&quot; in the context menu.<br/>
<br/>
5)Direct Link is not stopped automatically.<br/>
<br/>
*Direct Link is stopped automatically when switching the current view to &quot;Top/Plan&quot; or navigating to a Sheet Layer.<br/>

<br/>
When you create a viewport from a shaded front view of a rectangular 3D object, the edges won&#39;t be visible in the viewport by default. This is confusing, the edges should be shown.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, the shaded- edges will be rendered, despite the tight crop. If this isn&#39;t technically possible, maybe this can be done by taking a small extra margin from the object by default.<br/>

In the attached file, if one updates the window width both the PIO and the wall opening update to the new size.<br/>
<br/>
If one edits the window style, in a way that changes the width of the window (Either changing from Sash to Rough Opening or Vice Versa, or say set a new width and set the By Style toggle) the PIO updates its size, but the wall does not update to the new size until a reset is forced. See movie to replicate.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly another issue, Copy pasting a wall with a recess that has a PIO inserted causes undesired moves, or wall display. This issue is shown at the beginning of the demonstration movie. Please let me know if I should file a separate bug for that issue.

1. Sometimes the black panorama is generated, along with Vectorworks crash. <br/>
2. Sometimes a panorama is not generated at all and Vectorworks still crashed. In both cases the Crash Dump was 0 KB.<br/>
3. Sometimes a black panorama is generated without a Vectorworks crash<br/>
<br/>
I was not able to get a successful rendering at all. The black panorama is also generated by the Cloud Amazon server instances. <br/>
If I change the render settings to Renderworks Interior Fast, a panorama is generated properly

1. Open the attached VWX-file. Vectorworks uses 3,75GB RAM.<br/>
<br/>
2. Update Section Viewport &quot;Schnitt-1&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Time Taken: 2 minutes and 32 seconds.<br/>
Memory in use after the update ends is 9,11GB, in the next second briefly jumps to 11,46GB and then to 9,99GB RAM.<br/>
<br/>
3. Update Section Viewport &quot;Schnitt-4&quot;. Right before updating the RAM in use was 10,07GB.<br/>
<br/>
Time Taken: 4 minutes and 30 seconds<br/>
Memory in use after the update ends is 21,77GB RAM, a few seconds later goes down to 20,09GB RAM.<br/>
<br/>
The RAM in use remains at around 20 GB RAm and the Section Viewports react very slowly when being reselected. The Object Info takes a long time to re-appear.

-Drag the blue Wall to the left<br/>
<br/>
Note that the in-Wall object disappears.<br/>

This only seems to happen when the object is wide enough to extend past the centerline of the vertical Walls. For example if you move the blue Wall to the left by 1/2&quot; before inserting the object, you won&#39;t see the problem.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

Notice the wall feature changes its look. This worked OK in VW2022, but when I saved the file in VW2023 and performed the above steps, this started happening.<br/>

The offset seems to work as expected when only the outer components are wrapped. However, when the offset value for the inner component is similar or higher than the other components, things don&#39;t look right in Top/Plan.<br/>
<br/>
 For example: if all three offsets are 1/2 inch, then this looks as expected<br/>
<br/>
If all three offsets are 3/4&quot;, then the wrapping is incorrect<br/>
<br/>
If the two outer offsets are 1/2&quot; and the inner offset in 3/4&quot;, then the wrapping is correct. <br/>

There is no issue in source file, it only happens in the referenced file.<br/>

Issue is present also when Tile is used for 2D fill of the component without using the Material.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Changing the insertion location from &quot;Core Component - Center Line&quot; to &quot;Core Component - *Left Edge*&quot; and &quot;Core Component - *Right Edge*&quot; gives inconsistent results. Do you agree?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note when the &quot;Core Component - *Left Edge*&quot; is set, the outer (purple) component loses its round wrapping profile. This is what I think is the bug. This is not the case when the insertion location is set to &quot; Core Component - *Right Edge*&quot;

 <br/>
<br/>
-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
Note the window has insertion location &quot;Core Component - *Centerline*&quot; with an offset value of 0.<br/>
<br/>
-Open Plugin Object Options dialog and change the offset value to &quot; - 1.5 &quot; or &quot; - 2 &quot;<br/>
<br/>
-Close &quot;Plugin Object Options&quot; dialog<br/>
<br/>
-Notice the extra lines on the outer component.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The same issue occurs if the insertion location is set to &quot; Core Component -Left Edge&quot; or &quot; Core Component - Right Edge&quot; with an offset value in the Plugin Object Options dialog.<br/>
<br/>
It seems this issue occurs once the window touches the 2nd interior component?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Minor issue though.<br/>

And this is what they encounter - the rendering flashes and becomes transparent.<br/>

As you can see from the enclosed movie, when placing a Lighting Device using the Instrument Insertion tool, a preview symbol icon populates the Resource Manager called &quot;NNA_LD_PREVIEW&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Even if a Lighting Device has been placed it remains until you have left the tool. For the purposes of this report I renamed my user folder so it doesn&#39;t appear to be a corrupt setting.<br/>

Apparently this was possible in previous versions ( I have no experience with this so I personally am unsure).<br/>

The include reference Braceworks calculation setting is on in both files.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If a viewport is created while in any type of projection that is not 2d plan or orthogonal the viewport scale will come up wrong. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 * create a basic draw in the design layer on a 1/1 scale<br/>
 * choose a normal perspective (or narrow or wide perspective)<br/>
 * draw a rectangle on the top of the drawing <br/>
 * with the rectangle selected, create a viewport and use it as a crop<br/>
 * place it on a sheet layer and use a 1/1 scale<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note the dimensions of the drawing in the viewport do not match the drawing in the design layer. And the same does not happen when the projection is set to 2d plan or orthogonal. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

Activate the Rectangle tool then try drawing a rectangle that snaps to nearby geometry. As seen in the screen recording, corner points aren&#39;t as snappy as they usually are, plus there are erroneous snap points scattered about.<br/>

When not inside that extrude I can snap to the nearby geometry as expected.

                Depending on the scale, view, and projection settings of the design layer, Perspective Distance may be set to a very small value.

If the viewport is created in that state, if the viewport &quot;Projection:&quot; is set to &quot;Perspective&quot;, the angle of view will change significantly due to the influence of the Perspective Distance.<br/>
<br/>
Setting example to reproduce:<br/>
 Scale: &quot;1:50&quot; / View: &quot;Top/Plan&quot; / Projection: &quot;2D Plan&quot;<br/>
 In this case, Perspective Distance is automatically set to a very small value &quot;0.1952&quot;.<br/>
 *Not reproduced when the scale is &quot;1:1&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How to check Perspective Distance:<br/>
View menu&gt; Projection&gt; Set Custom Perspective ...<br/>
*&quot;0.1952&quot; is set in &quot;Distance:&quot;, and even if the OK button is pressed, it will be rejected.<br/>
Also, when the Cancel button is pressed, Projection is automatically changed to Normal Perspective and Perspective Distance is automatically changed to &quot;9.76&quot;. Therefore, if this check is done before creating the viewport, run the Undo menu once, restore Perspective and Perspective Distance, and then create the viewport.<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction example:<br/>
1) Open a new file, right-click in the drawing area&gt; click Active Layer Scale ..., set the scale to &quot;1:50&quot; and create an Extrude.<br/>
2) Execute View menu&gt; Create Viewport ... with the view set to Top / Plan and the projection set to 2D Plan.<br/>
3) Check that Projection is set to &quot;2D Plan&quot; and Perspective Dist is set to &quot;0.195&quot; (grayed out) in the Create Viewport dialog, and click the OK button to create a viewport on the sheet layer.<br/>
4) In the viewport OIP, check that Perspective Dist is corrected and set to &quot;0.250&quot;. * In the case of the cross-section viewport, it is set as &quot;0.195&quot; without correction, but both &quot;0.250&quot; and &quot;0.195&quot; are still very small values.<br/>
5) As a result of comparing the angle of view by switching the setting of &quot;Projection:&quot; between Perspective and Orthogonal in the OIP of the viewport, it can be seen that the angle of view changes significantly in the case of Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Please also refer to the reproduced movie &quot;12874.mov&quot; and “12874.vwx”.<br/>
<br/>
This Bug has been reported by a customer. I think it&#39;s a common case to change the &quot;Projection:&quot; setting to Perspective after creating a viewport. If this bug happens in that case, the customer will be confused without knowing what is wrong.<br/>
<br/>

When you select a few sections and update them then edit the crop of a different section viewport, the bounding box border stays visible for those sections. A simple pan/zoom fixes the problem.

 *Notice* the objects do not preselect highlight, the cursor doesn&#39;t snap to their geometry, and they cannot be selected by clicking on them.<br/>
<br/>
Hovering over the Door or Base Cabinet&#39;s insertion point at their bottom will trigger that object to now be snappable and selectable.  However, the Window doesn&#39;t seem to work that way - my guess is because its insertion point is below any geometry in the Window.  Another way to trigger the snapping and picking for these objects is to marquee select them.  After that, they behave as expected.<br/>

here&#39;s a customer file.<br/>
Customer complains that always a message plopping up telling something about constraints.<br/>
Objects in wall get lost when moving a wall or walls connect another way.<br/>
It&#39;s still present in 2022 SP3 RC2.<br/>
When I open that file in 2023, then it obviously gets repaired by conversion of walls from 2022 to 2023.<br/>
I was able to repair this file that way and export it to 2022.<br/>
But still there seems to be something fishy with walls.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Create a Section Viewport as shown and set the render mode to Shaded or RW<br/>
<br/>
Note that, with the default &quot;Infinite&quot; height range, the props fail to show.<br/>
<br/>
-Now edit the Extents and set a Finite height range as shown<br/>
<br/>
Note that this still has no effect. The only way to get the props to show is to add a large Crop to the SVP.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

In VW 2022 the move in 3 results in the Z (height) being kept the same, which makes moving of windows in wall easy on the same level.

3) Select the Top view from the Current View menu, or press the &quot;5&quot; key on the numeric keypad. The view shifts and the Red rectangle is now in the center of the VW window. The page boundary is, as yet, unmoved.<br/>
<br/>
4) Select the Top/Plan view from the Current View menu, or press the &quot;0&quot; key on the numeric keypad. The Red square stays in the center of the VW Window, but the Page Boundary moves so the page is again centered on the Absolute Origin (Green square).<br/>
<br/>
5) Repeat the sequence Top view, Top/Plan view, Top view, Top/Plan view..., and watch the colored squares walk off the screen. <br/>
<br/>
6) Any 3D view change (Top, Left, Front, Left Iso, etc.) followed by a 2D view change (Top/Plan) will walk the colored squares off the screen, each in its own direction, if repeated often enough.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This does not happen in earlier versions of VW. I&#39;ve checked in VW 2022, 2019, 2018, &amp; 2015. The view and page stay centered on the Absolute Origin in each of these versions when the view is toggled as described above.

<br/>
They should be dimensionless points, which is necessary. The 2022 SP3B1 version was perfect for displaying dots.<br/>
<br/>
The display with squares is done in the DesignLayer and in the viewports. Some old versions had this problem, but the viewports were beautiful. Since 2022 SP4, this is no longer the case, DesignLayer and viewport both display square cloud points.

The original file was created circa 2008 and the model of the studio dates to that creation. In v2022 there have been two iterations of the set designs, this is the third. The sheet layers all date tot he earlier designs, as do the deign layers that are turned off.<br/>
<br/>
I have been working and rendering on Design Layers. I understand that IS NOT best practice, but it is my workflow at this stage.<br/>
<br/>
There was an issue with camera 1-5-- the 0-0-0 symbol was displaying outside of the cropped area. Quitting and restarting solved this problem<br/>
<br/>
Camera 1 is not rendering two Vectorworks Light Objects that should have gobos projecting. While they were amongst there first of these and the first with shadows ON, I have had to turn others off, They still do not render in Shaded or a Renderworks style.

I found this little sweet spot that allows you to destroy the camera object (best seen on the screen record). However, the area is so small that it only happens with a slipped double click. Therefore, the chance of destroying the camera is very small.<br/>

They should be ‘slapped/snapped’ onto the core like magnetic sheets… taking on door and window openings built into the core wall…<br/>

This also makes changing and controlling wall finishes (through classes) a lot easier. <br/>

To reproduce, in each version:<br/>
<br/>
- Run the View/Rendering/Start Batch Render command<br/>
- Drag the render job to the right column and click OK<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, note that the render takes about 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2023, note that it takes about 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
If I just render in RW directly instead of using Batch Render, the speed in 2023 is about the same as 2022, so this look like it&#39;s specific to Batch Rendering.

Randomly, some surfaces will display as solid red instead of their actual color/texture. The issue seems to arise in the midst of heavy navigation (such as entering and exiting symbols and switching between sheet layers and design layers). It also seems to mostly affect solid additions / subtractions, and more frequently when the objects are flipped. Sometimes the red will flicker in and out and may even go away after flying around a bit. Most of the time the red stays until I re-generate the object (such as cutting and pasting-in-place, or double clicking inside of it).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately when I try to save a file to submit with this bug, the red is always gone upon re-opening (which is probably a good thing anyways). Regardless I&#39;ll attach the file that the screengrabs were from, even though it may not be an easily reproducible bug.<br/>

<br/>
If you add the attached settings folder to the user folder, the space tool doesn&#39;t function that well anymore. The options in the OIP ear very limited compared to a normal settings folder. This issue only occurs in the NL version. When using this settings folder in a EN version, there&#39;s no issue<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
- These customers lost a lot of options in the OIP in when they started working in version 2022. So they call support to ask why the space tool has less capabilities in version 2022 compared to 2021. This was strange, because on my computer the space tool still had all capabilities in version 2022. I discovered, by renaming these customer&#39;s Settings folder, this issue was resloved. So I decided to report their settings folder, because something must have gone wrong.<br/>
- Both customers only used NL versions. I just tested this settings folder on the US version to check whether the issue is related to a specific language version or not. If it is a problem as well in the US version, I usually send customer- specific bugs to tech support first for more info, before I put it in Mantis. I show this manipulation with the US version in the video, to prove it is an NL specific issue, so it makes no sense to share this with tech support. The customer herself, wasn&#39;t doing this manipulation at all.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short: this specific settings folder comes from a customer with a VW 2022 NL version who lost many options in the OIP. The content of this settings folder is causing the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Nele: I don&#39;t know where to look to solve this. It seems to be a localizing issue. Do you have suggestions?

notice at some angles the scene goes dark as if everything was in shadows, however shadows is not on.  This issue doesn&#39;t happen every time; you might need to activate some other saved views and fly around more.  I reproduced in winOS GTX 1050Ti.<br/>

===== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION =========<br/>
<br/>
In this file, we are having big problems with the Heliodon and Direct lights. When we first place them in the scene, they show and correctly cast shadows. We then save the view. We then switch to another view and then switch back but the lights have then disappeared (they no longer cast shadows).

seems like transparent objects stop drawing after zooming and panning at some point.  The big viewport stop showing transparent objects when view is to the right of a particular location-- which seem to be zoom dependent.  maybe octree problem.. * open [^Werkplan.vwx]<br/>
everything is fine when panning after file is first opened<br/>
 * zoom in and try to find the X coordinate where VGM navigation stops showing transparent objects when you pass it.  <br/>
In the video I draw a vertical line object to identify the place

<br/>
One of our clients is having an issue with a file.<br/>
In the file &#39;Trap abonnement&#39; there is a stair where some of the steps are hidden under the slab.<br/>
This file is linked as a reference in the file &#39;Abonnement bestand&#39;. In this file, all the steps are visible.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Tech support answer:<br/>
I just tested this in a brand new blank file. I drew a couple floor and added stairs to the lower floor and made the stairs visible in the floor above. In this file everything looks as it should, just like in the model file.<br/>
I then referenced this file into another file referencing the layers in the old-style method and see that the stairs appear on top of the slab like in the file you sent us.<br/>
I even tried just doing the newer workflow of design layer viewport and the stair appeared above the slab there as well.<br/>
I would recommend sending this to JIRA to have a look. I had not encountered this before.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Files are from 2021, but the bug also happens in 2022 SP3 version.

Furthermore:<br/>
<br/>
1. Click on Fit to Objects<br/>
<br/>
2. Press cmd+A to select all objects. Count equals to 886 Objects<br/>
<br/>
3. Deselect the obecjts and with the mouse select the group of objects seen on the top right corner (Screenshot-1.png). Count equals to 878 Objects.<br/>
<br/>
This means there are 8 objects spread on the sheet (just like the Wall Objects) that I suspect it can&#39;t be selected with the mouse as well.<br/>
<br/>
4. With this in mind, select the 878 Objects and delete them. The wall object isn&#39;t in place anymore.<br/>
<br/>
5. Press cmd+A and we can see in the OI: 8 Revision Cloud Object Objects, but if we press on the &quot;Fit to Objects&quot; button the file behaves as if its empty.<br/>
<br/>
Info from our Support:<br/>
<br/>
From our Support I&#39;ve got the following information (file is the one that ends with CWD  in the name) from tests done with VW2021. Note that my report and file was all done with VW2022 SP5.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;1. I opened the file sent by Frank and activated all classes<br/>
2. I repeatedly select all groups (via activate similar objects) and dissolve them.<br/>
3. I change the orientation of all objects from BE to KE.<br/>
4. I delete the objects that are far away.<br/>
5. Then I selected all the objects and moved them to a new layer.<br/>
6. I created a table of all objects and displayed the construction levels and object types<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; Here and in the file info you can see that there are still objects on the old construction layer. And now Frank and I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Can you locate the objects and move them to the new layer?<br/>
<br/>
Although there are puppet objects in the file, when I delete the objects are still in the drawing.&quot;

If your plan is rotated and you create an aisle through a seating section with rectangular mode, the resulting isle is drawn perpendicular to the non- rotated plan in stead of the rotated plan. This leads to undesirable results.

                Question: Why does libcef.dll have so many critical events?
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hi team, <br/>
<br/>
When using Vectorworks on Windows a few years ago, the Reliability History graph in the Reliability Monitor app would typically display an excellent trend line. A poor trend line used to be a good indicator that their files or installation needed something corrected. But with more recent versions of Vectorworks, Reliability History reports many &#39;critical events&#39; most of which are not evident while using Vectorworks. Because the reported errors no longer correlate with noticeable problems: <br/>
<br/>
a) This graph can no longer be relied upon to get a sense of how stable a user&#39;s installation of Vectorworks is. <br/>
<br/>
b) I can&#39;t tell if these are false positives or if there are actual problems that need to be resolved - bugs, corrupt files/data, or a troubled installation of Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
One of the two most cited &#39;Fault Modules&#39; is libcef.dll. -I want to learn more about this library/component but despite searching and manually looking in all the normal places it should be, I can&#39;t even find it.- - I&#39;ve just found it. Duh! I&#39;m at a loss to explain why it didn&#39;t show up in my use of the File Explorer search function. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m aware that just because a DLL is cited in an error report it does not mean it is the true cause of a problem. And I&#39;m aware that libcef.dll is part of the Chromium Embedded Framework. <br/>
<br/>
Can you please advise - or at least theorise - why libcef.dll is cited in so many &quot;Critical Events&quot; in Reliability History? <br/>

<br/>
How to reproduce the problem:<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached Vectorworks file.<br/>
<br/>
2. Select &quot;Kamera-1&quot; and in the OI Activate Camera View.<br/>
<br/>
3. Switch Render to Shaded<br/>
<br/>
4. Open the Visualization Tool Set and select Walkthrough Gamer Mode<br/>
<br/>
5. With the left mouse button click on the drawing and move to mouse to the sides to look around<br/>
<br/>
6. Change Perspective to Normal Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
7 Repeat step 5.<br/>
<br/>
One of two happens during this actions: while rotating the camera to look around it will show the outside of the building, it is expected to show only the inside since the camera is inside. Other times also happened that the camera stays completely outside showing the outside of the building. Both results are wrong. We expect that while rotating the camera, the outside will not be shown at all, doesn&#39;t matter how close the camera is from the walls we shouldn&#39;t see anything further the walls.

If exported as &quot;Rasterize PDF&quot; it works ok but it isn&#39;t ideal as it loses most of its quality.  <br/>

<br/>
A user&#39;s Vectorworks file has somehow been converted from a professional file to an educational file. It is now watermarked, &#39;Vectorworks Education Version.&#39; I had explained to her about a week before how to avoid this, including not copy-pasting or importing any objects or resources from any educational files. All her files were converted from professional so she is not sure how this happened. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect she has used the Resource Manager to unknowingly browse an educational file she still had. She wants to avoid accidentally/inadvertently doing anything that might cause this to happen again. In order to do so, she has asked if we can identify what objects or resources she introduced (if any) to her file, that caused it to convert to Edu. <br/>
<br/>
*Do you have the means to identify objects or resources that were copy-pasted OR imported from an Edu file?* Is this simply a matter of searching a special sequence of characters after opening the Vectorworks file in a text editor?

Then you have to change in the OIP the type of the speaker (with type scrolling menu) for another speaker, then reselect again the first you chose, and the weight is correctly coming.<br/>

To reproduce, render in Wireframe and note that the red pen from the modifiers often fails to show on some or all segments. If you adjust the view slightly you can sometimes then see the missing segments, but it&#39;s not consistent.<br/>

If you don&#39;t see the problem at first, try updating the Site Model while rendered in Shaded mode, then switch back to Wireframe.<br/>

<br/>
Attached is a screen recording which demonstrates this issue (starting around 00:15).<br/>
<br/>
If I ungroup the extrude, the alignment fixes itself and the wood is correctly aligned to each edge. It should look this way without needing to ungroup the Extrude.

I first do it in Orthogonal Projection and it works fine. Then I switch to Perspective Projection. Notice how when I&#39;m trying to rotate the object, the cursor is arbitrarily snapping to certain angles / increments, even if I suspend all snapping options. (I don&#39;t think this issue is caused by snaps at all, actually.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is amplified when the cursor is near the fulcrum while rotating. There seems to be an issue with the screen resolution being used in the operation when in Perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I first noticed an issue along these lines in Fall of 2020. It may or may not affect more operations than just Rotate; however, today was the first time I figured out how to reproduce the issue.<br/>

====== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION =========<br/>
<br/>
This is minor but worth noting.<br/>
 In the video capture.<br/>
 -I have set the background color to dark.<br/>
 -Notice when I render in Shaded and Fast Renderworks or FQRW,<br/>
 the clip cube border is clearly visible.<br/>
 -But if I try with any of the Redshift render mode, the border is very difficult to <br/>
 see. This is because of the following combination. My use of Dark Background, and when <br/>
 you use a Redshift render, default sky background is created.

I tested in Windows&#39; Notepad application and I don&#39;t see the same issue.<br/>
<br/>
First you&#39;ll need to change the Windows OS system locale to Korean (See attached image)<br/>
-In your Windows OS, search for, &quot;Language Settings&quot;<br/>
-When the Language dialog appear, scroll down and choose, &quot;Administrative language settings&quot; or similar<br/>
-Switch to the, &quot;Administrative&quot; tab<br/>
-&quot;Change system locale...&quot; and choose Korean<br/>
-Apply the change and restart the computer<br/>
-Launch Vectorworks<br/>
-On the Windows TaskBar, toggle to the Korean (Hangul) input method<br/>
-Back in Vectorworks, select the Text Tool<br/>
-Type a few characters of text, then press the SpaceBar and you&#39;ll notice the last character you typed, is repeated, when Space is pressed (see attached video)<br/>

However, I find that occasionally the textures on some faces follow an edge that is clearly not the longest. I&#39;ve attached a file showing an example of this, where the texture on the top surface is aligning itself with the short &quot;horizontal&quot; edge rather than the clearly much longer &quot;diagonal&quot; edge.<br/>
<br/>
Also attaching a screenshot which shows the situation above, plus a similar object which is aligning the texture correctly.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Create a new Object Style from the Graphic Legend<br/>
-Edit the style, then edit the style&#39;s Cell Layout<br/>
-Set the dynamic Text object to use &quot;Text Style-1&quot; and exit<br/>
-Edit the Text Style and make some changes<br/>
-Update the legend<br/>
<br/>
Note that the legend shows the text correctly at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now edit the GL style and click OK without making any changes<br/>
<br/>
Note that the dynamic text reverts back to its previous settings, even though it still technically uses &quot;Text Style-1&quot;.

                VS commands SetWorkingPlane() and SetWorkingPlaneN() do not persist after script ends
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      My initial intent was to set a WP by script and have it persist after the script ended, but neither command effects persist beyond the end of a script.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought SetWorkingPlane() and SetWorkingPlaneN() did not work at all because the Working Plane (WP) was not active when the script ended. Then I tried using the WP while the script was running and found the WP was valid and I could draw on it but only during a single execution of a script. Both scripts produce equivalent workable results while a script is running.<br/>
<br/>
The documentation for *SetWorkingPlaneN*() says:<br/>
*Description*<br/>
   Set the active working plane.<br/>
<br/>
while the documentation for *SetWorkingPlane*() says:<br/>
*Description*<br/>
   Sets the x, y, and z offset of the working plane as well as the x-, y-, and z-plane rotational values.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the descriptions makes reference of the command&#39;s temporary nature.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the behavior of commands like SetView(), SetViewVector(), SetVCenter(), and SetZoom(), I expected SetWorkingPlane() and SetWorkingPlaneN() to persist after a script finished. The current behavior severely limits the usefulness of these two commands, and there appears to be no workaround in VS to achieve a persistent result.<br/>

<br/>
For any reason the window sills are getting rotated 90 degrees on the render style white model.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The window used is part of Vectorworks library. There was some modifications made to it on their settings. <br/>
<br/>
If the sill is made of brick or timber this does not happens. <br/>
<br/>
Seems the windows got corrupted? Could you spot the reason causing this? <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks!! <br/>

                VS command HCenter() does not work for 3D Planar objects after VW 2019
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In VW versions prior to VW 2020, HCenter() returned the center of a 2D planar object relative to its Working Plane&#39;s (WP) origin. In VW 2020 and newer, HCenter() returns the absolute XY coordinate of the 2D planar object. This newer behavior breaks a lot of scripts I&#39;ve written that work on 2D Planar objects.<br/>
<br/>
The attached file is saved in VW 2017 format, and can be opened in all versions of VW from 2017 to the present. Compare specifically how the script runs in VW 2019 and then in VW 2020. <br/>
<br/>
Open the file in VW 2019 (or older) and run the script. Note the planar rectangle&#39;s center shows as (0.25, 0.25) relative to its WP which is centered on the left side of the extruded square in the middle of the drawing. <br/>
<br/>
Open the file in VW 2020 (or newer) and run the script. Note the planar rectangle&#39;s center now shows as (-0.5, -0.25) which is the absolute XY point (Z is omitted) in 3D space of the rectangle&#39;s center. The returned value is in no way linked to the WP on which the object is drawn. <br/>
<br/>
Desired behavior — for 2D planar objects, HCenter() should return the coordinate of the object&#39;s center relative to the planar object&#39;s WP origin. This is a regression.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      In the attached file I have a planar square drawn on a Working Plane (WP) placed on the left side of a 2x2x2 Extrude. When the planar square&#39;s WP is displayed and the &quot;Working Plane Views&quot; icon (pink planar icon) is selected in the View Var, selecting the BACK view changes the WP and rotates the view to Rotated Top (-90°). <br/>
<br/>
This does not happen for some objects on other working planes, but it is 100 % repeatable in this example.<br/>
<br/>
I tried this in VW 2015 and get the same result, so if it is a regression, it is not a recent one. <br/>
<br/>
Open the attached file and follow these steps.<br/>
<br/>
1) Select the white planar square on the extrude&#39;s left side.<br/>
2) Double click on it to show its Working Plane (WP.) The <br/>
     WP appears as a semi-opaque pink square.<br/>
3) Select the Working Plane Views icon in the View Bar.<br/>
4) Use the keys on the numeric keypad to change the view<br/>
     relative to the selected object.<br/>
5) When you press the 5 (top), 1 (left-iso), 3 (right-iso),<br/>
     7 (back left-iso), &amp; 9 (back right-iso) keys the pink WP<br/>
     displays a solid pink border as the view shifts.<br/>
6) Pressing the 2 (front), 4 (left), 6 (right), &amp; 8 (back) keys,<br/>
     shows the WP viewed edge on and the edge of the<br/>
     WP takes on a dashed pink line appearance.<br/>
7) Press the 8 (back) key and note the WP now has a solid<br/>
     edge again. THE WP HAS CHANGED, and the view is<br/>
     now Rotated Top. You will have to double click on the<br/>
     white square again to reshow the white square&#39;s WP.

For example, in the attached file, most of the objects within symbols are on the None class. I&#39;ve provided a piece of geometry on the None class to hover over. You should see that there are numerous issues with the red highlighting being displayed:<br/>
<br/>
-Rotated symbols display an unrotated highlight.<br/>
<br/>
-Some symbols display the highlight offset from the geometry location.<br/>
<br/>
-The highlight is of the 3D part of the symbol even with hybrid symbols in Top/Plan.<br/>
<br/>
-In 3D, a double highlight is displayed, both of the 3D part of the symbol (but in the wrong spot) and of the 2D part of the symbol (a highlight which ironically doesn&#39;t appear in Top/Plan)... look at the pianos, for example.<br/>

Fact that it&#39;s so close to the Wall means you need to zoom in but when you do it behaves strangely. <br/>

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Activate the Offset Edge tool in Edge Loop Mode, with both Push/Pull modes enabled<br/>
-Offset the edge on the top face of the Solid Section object, using a negative push/pull value to create a subtraction<br/>
<br/>
Note that this works fine.<br/>
<br/>
-Now try the same thing on the top face of the Sweep object<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the push/pull direction is reversed (you have to enter a positive value for the shape to extend into the existing solid) and the resulting object is a Solid Addition instead of a Solid Subtraction, so the overall shape fails to change.

Open the attached test file and Update the OpenGL viewport on Sht-2 (the file is saved on it). Shortly after the rendering starts, Vectorworks crashes. I am seeing this issue only on my Windows computer, as well as on our Cloud servers, which are also Windows-based. The weird thing is that on the Cloud, the job completes successfully sometimes on the exact same server where it crashed previously, but most of the time it crashes.

In a sheet layer viewport with option text scale 50% the dim values get displaced. But only when show elevation is used. When show elevation disabled, then no displacement.<br/>
<br/>
No displacement when I create a new document and recreate the situation on my own. See my own testfile MyExample.vwx. I have created the dim standard MySIA in this file and it is working fine, which means no displacement.<br/>
<br/>
I also created a dim standard MySIA2 in customer file Bemassung.vwx. When I use this dim standard, then I get a displacement too.<br/>
<br/>
When I import dim standard MySIA from my testfile into customer file, I still get a displacement.<br/>
When I import dim stadard MySIA2 from customer file into my testfile, I get a displacement.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please have a look?<br/>
Maybe it is only the customer file which causes the trouble. This would be fine.<br/>
Or the custom dim standards from older files do cause the trouble when they get converted in to newer files?<br/>
I think someone should look into this to clarify this issue.<br/>

<br/>
notice the frame flickers between 1 and 2 pixels wide.  I believe VGM rasterizes wide lines as rectangles.  vw2021 might have had GL_LINE_SMOOTH on for frame. We would have to do multisample, some AA, or clamp triangle vertices to pixel corners (for vertical/horizontal wide lines) to get seemingly consistent pixel widths.  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-rasterizer-stage-rules#line-rasterization-rules-aliased-without-multisampling] talks about dx rasterization<br/>

=====ORIGINAL BUG by bervoets=======<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you view a 2D object with line thickness 0,35 or more in a 3D view, the line thicknesses are not displayed equally thick an all sides. This is a minor display bug, but it is a regression compared to version 2021.

<br/>
Such documentation is required as we need to provide official information to customers who are experiencing this issue.<br/>
*Currently, we are receiving inquiries from multiple customers who are experiencing this problem. And it is expected that the number of inquiries will increase in the future.<br/>
<br/>
How this question came about:<br/>
On some customers&#39; Windows PCs, Vectorworks2022 crashes when basic document window operations such as resizing the application window, switching between multi-file drawing windows, switching workspaces, and docking and undocking palettes occur.<br/>
Also, after the crash, the following error message is displayed.<br/>
&quot;DirectX 11 graphics has been modified by an external application and this is interfering with normal Vectorworks operation. Please see Tech Bulletin. Vectorworks will now quit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The following pages are linked from &quot;Tech Bulletin&quot; in the error message.<br/>
-Vectorworks 2022 crashing in DirectX 11 on some Windows systems --Tech Bulletins --Vectorworks Community Board<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/tech-bulletins/directx11/<br/>
<br/>
This page explains that this is a phenomenon caused by competing with utility apps of other companies that use DirectX 11, and gives an example of an app that causes this problem.<br/>
However, there are comments that the deletion of one example of the app that causes this problem does not fix it, or that the other apps have been deleted, so I do not know which information is certain and which information is uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, we have received requests from customers to disclose information on this issue in Japanese.<br/>
However, since it is information that requires the name of other companies&#39; software and it is difficult to disclose information with uncertain information, accurate information is desired.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have additional questions. Is there a plan to fix this problem with the SP of Vectorworks2022 in the first place?<br/>
If there is no plan to fix it, there are some concerns, for example, Dell&#39;s PC should be excluded from the target machines.<br/>
<br/>

- Make the section viewport calculation able to handle this<br/>
- Simplify the geometry of this object (for example use a texture to render the vertical bars or fix whatever is making this so heavy)<br/>
- Remove this object from the library<br/>

The visibility of the layer changes correctly, but the check box in the Navigation Palette does not update.  If the layer is visible and you pass N1=-1 it is set to invisible, if N1=0 then the layer is set to visible. This works properly. Only the Nav Palette update is incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Selecting the mislabeled layer in the Navigation Palette does not update the visibility setting. Selecting the mislabeled layer in the Data Bar Layers pull down menu does update the incorrect visibility settings.<br/>

This behavior is the same as in VW2021.

Labels will be simplified for human readability, compared to 2022 SP0.&quot;<br/>
 (Page 9, &quot;Improved Object Labels&quot; paragraph)<br/>
<br/>
We placed the same door style in Vectorworks 2022 SP0(604624) and SP3RC2 (635820) and exported as a Datasmith file, but we couldn&#39;t see any changes on the object labels on Twinmotion.<br/>
<br/>
We have checked with following steps as follows.<br/>
 We would like to ask you that our way is suitable to check or not.<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if it&#39;s incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
steps<br/>
<br/>
1) Place a door with the door tool.<br/>
<br/>
2) Select the door and choose &quot;Replace&quot; from &quot;Style&quot; dropdown on OIP.<br/>
<br/>
3) Click the drop-down and choose &quot;Hinged Doors Metric.vwx&quot; from Vectorworks Libraries on the left pane.<br/>
<br/>
4) Then select &quot;Door Entry w Sidelights(BSI)&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5) Run &quot;Export Unreal Datasmith (3D only)&quot; and export to any destination.<br/>
<br/>
6) Launch Twinmotion.<br/>
<br/>
7) Click &quot;Import&quot; and then click the &quot;GEOMETRY&quot; tab.<br/>
<br/>
8) Click Open and select the exported Datasmith file.<br/>
<br/>
9) Click the left-pointing triangle on the upper right of screen and the operation panel shows. <br/>
 Click the right-pointing triangle of &quot;Scene graph&quot; to expand the group, then click the right-pointing triangle of bottom.<br/>
<br/>
10) Check the object label &quot;Extrude_Glazing-Clear&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
*Even though following above steps in Vectorworks2022 SP3 RC2, the object label is still &quot;Extrude_Glazing-Clear&quot;.(SP0&amp;SP3.png)<br/>
 It won&#39;t be like images on the Task overview.<br/>
<br/>
*Please let us know the way of confirming the improve.<br/>

A user contacted us saying that after setting the class for a roof object to invisible, the roof disappeared (as expected) but then after setting that class back to visible, it did not reappear (without some wrangling). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since recreated this problem in a new blank document, and determined this problem only occurs when a Floating View Pane is present. See the attached file and screen recording.

&quot;Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t dealt with Solidworks in many many years. However, I believe that all &quot;solid&quot; objects in Vectorworks will only go out as surfaces. I think this is a limitation more than a bug. We do not handle solid geometry like some of these solid modeling applications. I am not aware of any way around this.<br/>

 # start in a blank file<br/>
2. create a test label legend to make sure 3D label legends work in the file<br/>
4. reference label legend from a different file<br/>
5. Go through a series of pop ups, the last one is the one about replacing the __NNA_SL_3DLabel_Record Format<br/>
6. switch the label legend of the fixture to the new reference label, see that it doesn&#39;t work, and the label is broken when switching back to the file&#39;s original test label<br/>
<br/>
I have included a video that they shared with me.  I started testing in sp2.1 and sp3 is giving me the same results.  I didn&#39;t include any of my test files since it seems all files and label legends do it, but I can upload any if needed.

                Polygon gets line endpoint style via class style

<br/>
On Windows, a line endpoint style is added to the polygon when you give it the class attributes. On MacOS in comparison, this does not happen. I think on windows the behavior should be the same as on macOS that it ignores the line endpoint style when adding the class attributes.<br/>

I rarely use snap to distance. When I used it today, I set the snap distance to 1/3. The percent snap did not change from 25% to 33.33% and indeed, even though I had selected &quot;fraction&quot; (1/3) it snaps to 25%<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clicking &quot;reset to defaults&quot; and then changing the fraction does result in a proper percentage.<br/>
<br/>
Strange initial behavior that can be fixed by the user but they need to know what to do.<br/>

Sometimes in specific files I have really hard graphical issues in shaded view. I&#39;ve included a video and file of what is going on.<br/>

This can usually be fixed by resizing the pane, but you might also have to resize and then move it.<br/>

The same thing happens going back to 2022 SP0 but I don&#39;t see this in VW 2021.<br/>

If I try to make the file smaller by deleting objects, the problem goes away.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-In the Resource Manager, delete the &quot;Paint-Tan&quot; texture<br/>
-Choose to replace it with the &quot;Paint-White&quot; texture<br/>
<br/>
Note that the sides of the Roof Faces take-on a black texture/color.<br/>

-Now select a Roof Face and go to the OIP Render tab<br/>
-Re-select the &quot;Paint-White&quot; texture from the texture menu for the Sides part<br/>

Note that the textures now show correctly in the drawing.<br/>

I want to make a 2D section that I can paste in my drawing file. When you open the file you should see the set designer&#39;s Section VP on a Sheet Layer.<br/>
<br/>
For me on my machine, I&#39;m finding this VP nearly impossible to deal with. Updating it takes a long time, same for duplicating. I&#39;ve tried set the 3D display to LOW and turning off the &quot;Venue&quot; Layer. I tried to do a &#39;Convert to Lines&#39; on the VP to get 2D geometry and my VW pretty much became unusable. I suspect the end result is tens of thousands of lines. I typically have to force quit. Not only does it slow down just VW, but my entire machine grinds to a halt.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do about this? I can&#39;t really tell the set designer &quot;don&#39;t use so many curves&quot;, etc. as they make one 3D model which they use for all the elevations, etc. Is it my machine?  Is this too much for VW to handle? Is there something particularly unique about this file that is causing the problem? Just looking for some help.<br/>

thanks,<br/>

Conditions that occur:<br/>
When creating an Extrude Along Path, if the Line of the path object is parallel to the Y axis and tilted with respect to the Z axis <br/>
<br/>
Reproducibility procedure:<br/>
1) Open the sample file &quot;12761.vwx&quot; with VW2022. Polygon, which is a cross-section figure, and Line, which is a path object, are selected. Line is parallel to the Y axis and tilted to the Z axis.<br/>
2) Run Model menu&gt; Extrude Along Path, make sure Line is selected as the path object, and click OK with the default settings in the Extrude Along Path dialog.<br/>
3) Looking at the cross section of the created Extrude Along Path, the angle is rotated 90 degrees. In the case of VW2020, it is rotated 34.14 degrees, so it is very different. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, if the path object is tilted even slightly with respect to the Y axis, there is no difference in the cross-sectional angle between VW2022 and VW2020. A sample file &quot;12761_Various_patterns.vwx&quot; that can confirm this is also attached. In addition, the sample file output for confirmation with VW2020 is also attached. <br/>
And just in case, I will attach a video of the reproduction with VW2022. <br/>
<br/>
The Vectorworks operation manual used by the customer already has a guidebook that considers the rotation of the cross section of the Extrude Along Path. In the first place, we do not understand the reason why the cross section of Extrude Along Path rotates.<br/>
Therefore, if it is a specification change after VW2021, please tell us the reason for the change. <br/>
<br/>

Linear PIO&#39;s should behave like lines in Unrestricted Interactive Scaling mode, reshaping them all. However, drawing the endpoint of the PIO produces no change in the objects.<br/>
<br/>
The reshape tool works as expected.

wall features are displayed incorrect at the connection point of two walls.<br/>

<br/>
Whether I am in an existing file, or creating a new file, the plant object&#39;s 3D graphics edit mode does not maintain the Shaded setting I have chosen for 3D view render mode. It does render Shaded when I then choose it from my render settings pull down menu, but in returning to top/plan and then trying a 3D view it goes back to wireframe.<br/>
<br/>
Users will want the shaded view to see the plant&#39;s rendered representation, especially if they are using image props, as this is the only way to actually see the plant image in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Note that outside of the plant 3D graphics editing, the Shaded render view is maintained as expected. This bug seems to be just in the editing screen operations.

<br/>
To reproduce, open the file in each version and resize the floating pane.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2021, note that the graphics in the pane remain static while the resize is done.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022, note that the graphics get stretched as the pane is resized, causing them to show the wrong aspect ratio temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens going back to 2022 SP0.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 10 this happens to some degree but it isn&#39;t as noticeable as Mac. On Windows the graphics also flicker as the pane is being resized (which doesn&#39;t happen in 2021).

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # In Preferences/Edit make sure *Edit text horizontally be default* is checked.<br/>
 # Set up a file with project sharing, with some text content - the Platform/Text Edit test file can be used, or create a new file with a text object that has some wrapped text.<br/>
 # Switch from Top/Plan to an isometric view e.g. via keypad 1<br/>
 # Double-click a text object to edit it, enter some text, hit enter.<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: after rotating for edit, the text returns to its orthogonal projection and appears as there along with the edit<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the text box is rendered as a solid gray block, you can no longer see any text. However if you force a re-render e.g. by dragging the canvas the text re-appears.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be a momentary 3D text rendering bug caused by project sharing. Happens on both Mac and Windows.

On their 16&quot; MacBook Pro M1 Max machine, the toilet symbol appears correctly in wireframe, but when rendered in Shaded mode, the pan shifts and is rotated down 90° (see image M1 Mac (incorrect)). On an Intel machine, this does not happen (see image Intel Mac (correct)). The file is also attached for testing (Wall Hung Toilet.vwx).<br/>
<br/>
In addition, ghosting also apparently occurs and images of other design layers remain on-screen when the layers have been hidden, with the only rectification being to quit and restart Vw.<br/>

This is not correct, there are no vectors in VS Python, meant are: tuples.<br/>
If we want to have a vector class, we must make one or use some external library.<br/>
<br/>
This is totally confusing for the novice Python user, expecting vector operations to work out of the box. There is quite a number of clarifications in this sense in the Techboard. <br/>
<br/>
We need the documentation to state the variable types as they are: tuples.<br/>

We find very strange that using Vw 2020 we can get the image put in a very close position to the expected one.

For what I can understand, any hybrid symbol will start showing as a filled rectangle when class is hidden. This happens in any 3D view, even if unified view is on or off.<br/>

3) Click &quot;Edit License File&quot; button in the middle.<br/>
4) The content of the license file shows. <br/>
Enter &quot;ISV vektorwrxport=1111&quot; on the last line.<br/>

5) Click the &quot;Update License File&quot; button.<br/>
6) Something like an error message shows and the changes are lost.<br/>

When double clicking the point plug-in object, the speaker will be inserted as speaker.<br/>
But that is an one-time event only. If you insert it a 2nd time, it will inserted as symbol.<br/>
<br/>
If doing the same with the 2D/3D symbol it will always get inserted as symbol and not as speaker.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how they managed to get an point plug-in object, but when checking this object, I can&#39;t even see the database of that speaker.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me what is going on here?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In my test, I placed a distro in a new blank document with auto numbering set to prefix &quot;Test-&quot; and starting value of &quot;A.&quot;<br/>

I then changed the prefix to &quot;Wrong-&quot; <br/>

Now, duplicate the one distro and note the ID name. It should read &quot;Test-A-2&quot;, but instead reads &quot;Wrong-B&quot;<br/>

3) If you hover the cursor on the truss created in step 1), a highlighted line shows and a truss connects to it when clicked.<br/>

                Mac - Resource manager shift-selection behavior temporarily broken after drag
    </p>
</td>

<br/>
When viewing the current file&#39;s imported resources in the Resource Manager, you can select multiple resources by dragging the mouse or by using shift-click to extend the current selection.<br/>
<br/>
You can also drag some resources into a folder. After you drop and those resources are removed from the current folder, another adjacent resource will be automatically selected.<br/>
<br/>
This automatic selection is in a weird state. You can&#39;t shift-click to select additional resources.<br/>
<br/>
It may not be obvious because if you change the selection by directly clicking on another object, by command-clicking, or using arrow keys, the problem is cleared up.<br/>
<br/>
I found it first in Mainline, reproduced in VW2022 SP1.1.<br/>
<br/>
I will look into fixing this as part of the other bug which also relates to selection after drag.

Savvy Linesets relies on this field to store and display the lineset on which rigging objects and soft goods hang. In the case of soft goods, most drawings with pre-rigged line sets will not include the pipe (or other rigging object) in drawings, so this field is critical in indicating where the item hangs. This is distinct from Position, which has been added, and would refer to a named position.<br/>
<br/>
The Location field was actually added to rigging objects at my request several years ago, and has worked its way into many users workflows.

This problem happens with Realistic background render styles. Also when there is a background fill within the section viewport.<br/>

-Open test file<br/>
<br/>
-Render in Realistic Exterior Fat or Realistic Spotlight background render modes then update the HSVP<br/>

-Edit annotations and move the drawing label then exit viewport annotation<br/>

<br/>
A little detail in the editing symbol mask overlay. When you switch to 2D symbol editing via the design layer, you are shown a view from top with the auxiliary axes X/Y, although the current view says Top/Plan. When you edit the 2D components of the symbol via the resource manager, you are shown a current view as top/plan without the auxiliary axes.<br/>
I think the view without auxiliary axes would be the correct one, since these are only displayed in 3D.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Make sure the Resource Manger window is visible and is set to auto-hide on mouse-out<br/>
 # Click in the search field and begin typing to search<br/>
 # While search edit field is still active, move mouse out of window<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: while actively typing in the search edit field, the window will not collapse due to accidental mouse movements<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the window disappears requiring you to mouse back over the panel title bar in order to show it again and continue typing<br/>

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a valid case for needing to hide the resource manager contents and see the document while in the middle of a search. If the user wants to stop searching so that the RM window will hide, they should be able to hit esc to exit the active edit field mode<br/>
<br/>
OTOH it is very easy, particularly working on a laptop with a trackpad, to accidentally move the cursor while typing and then have one&#39;s search interrupted by the window disappearing, making this a usability bug

                Resource Browser does not update downloaded badge after import of abstract person
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Minor usability issue found in acceptance testing - I think this is likely not new, will also check on Mac. <br/>
<br/>
Precondition: person resources have not yet been downloaded (so &quot;Abstract Person 1&quot; will show a cloud-download badge on its icon).<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # In Resource Manager (icon view) type &quot;person&quot; and hit enter in search field to show person resources<br/>
 # Find Abstract Person 1; it should not yet be downloaded and so should display the cloud-download badge on its icon<br/>
 # Right-click the resource and choose Import; accept the import in the dialog<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the Abstract Person 1 resource is downloaded and imported to the document, and its icon in the content pane is updated to no longer have the cloud-download badge<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the Abstract Person 1 resource still has the cloud-download badge even though it has been successfully downloaded and imported. If you change selection to the current document in the Resource Manager organizer, you will see the Abstract Person 1 icon there without the download badge.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE that this does not happen with all resources - for example when you download a texture, it seems that its icon will update immediately to remove the download badge, providing visual feedback that the download and import was successful<br/>
<br/>
ALSO ON MAC: I tested this and reproduced the same issue using a different un-downloaded resource, from furniture, &quot;Furn Knoll Generation Armless w/Casters&quot; in Premium Libraries/Interior/Furniture/Knoll.<br/>
<br/>
See attached screenshots.

<br/>
When editing first the image with the Attribute Mapping Tool to increase its size and afterwards export it to PDF, the result displays the image still correct. That is Test-File2.pdf result.<br/>
<br/>
...BUT... like its shown in the video, after increasing the image a certain size (more than the previous one), then the PDF result displayed the image darker than its original seen with Vectorworks. That is Test-File3.pdf result.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this. Thank you.

                ConnectCAD: Check Drawing gives signal type mismatch for passive sockets

                                            <td class="description">      [Conrad] Original title: Patchfield socket and signal type.<br/>
See Jess&#39;s comment below - in fact the problem is that he (and therefore other users) interprets the signal mismatch warnings as a fatal error and then gets into the trip of changing all the jackfield socket signal types. So in terms of what to do about this I think we should not flag a mismatch when one side of the circuit has passive signal type since in fact the circuit gets its signal from the non-passive side.<br/>
<br/>
[Jess] Currently when inserting a patch field it is only possible to set the connector type for each side (left and right) in the tool preferences. <br/>
 This means there is no way to set the type of socket (in, out, I/O) or signal for each side, you then have to manually edit the patch field sockets after creation to define this.<br/>
<br/>
It would help streamline the insertion process by adding the signal and socket type settings to the tool preferences so users can set this at insertion and not have to go back an manually edit the patch fields afterwords

{{kTolu: Invalid itemHit; It should NOT get here}}<br/>

Turns out pressing escape or clicking the X to close the dialog results in two messages being sent on the dialog handler on Mac:<br/>
kCancelButtonID (2) and kSetdownMessage<br/>
<br/>
On Windows, this is very different. * When pressing the X, only kSetdownMessage is sent<br/>
 * Pressing the escape key sends -1 (hardcoded, no constant exists) + kSetdownMessage<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most dialogs only process kSetdownMessage which behaves exactly the same on both platforms. The behavior of the other messages should be consolidated.

1) open new empty document<br/>

3) create symbol<br/>
4) insert symbol into design layer with different scale<br/>
5) edit inserted symbol and insert a new node<br/>
--&gt; new node has different scale to already present nodes<br/>
<br/>
To fix it you have to move all nodes in the network to reset their scale.

<br/>
There is a sample on the Developer web site that shows the use of tkinter and it will not run on a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
 https://developer.vectorworks.net/index.php/Python_sample_to_Import_elevation<br/>
<br/>
Download and open the SurveyEarchScripts.vwx file from the above link on a Mac and try to run the Import Elevations script. You will get an error message that tkinter is probably not installed.<br/>
<br/>
There is a post in the forum back in 2016 that tkinter needs a special install on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/46794-vectorworks-and-tkinter/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=238234<br/>
<br/>
If the sample scripts show the use of tkinter it should run.<br/>
<br/>
Since it appears in the Python Framework inside the Mac app package it should be installed.<br/>
<br/>
Expected behavior tkinter should be able to be imported into a Python script with no external library installation required.

If I edit the record format and uncheck use commas, figures above 999.99 will be reported in the tag.

<br/>
This makes sense because in 2D mode the Elevation Benchmark refers to the y-axis and  the Plan Rotation only rotates the view but not the axis itself. Therefore ther there is no sense in rotation the Elevation Benchmark.<br/>
<br/>
But with a Benchmark Datum set to Control Point the Elevation Benchmark can be rotated and this will consider the new rotated axis (of the object itself) as height to display. In this case, the Elevation Benchmark should be inserted with the current rotation.<br/>

However, the Mesh does show as having been selected in the OIP with all of the selection methods mentioned above.<br/>

This is most confusing when VW Pref &quot;Enable selection highlighting&quot; is disabled. When the pref is ON, there are still no selection handles. but the Mesh does glow with the selection color, though it still cannot be resized unless it was selected without the Option-Marquee method.<br/>

The customer is working on a tutorial file and linked vision to the ETC/Eos software on the same computer (via sAcn). It happened there regularly.<br/>

Working on a new file went well but working on an almost empty file (2 objects, 1 spot) and it also crashed.<br/>

The customer gets a crash report from the computer, not from Vision. When he restart Vision after a crash he gets the message asking if he want to start in save mode.<br/>

In the enclosed Vision file the are 4 viewports. All lights should be turned on and all viewports rendered as solid.<br/>

I left it open like that, put it in the background, did some other things notably not Vectorworks things but Vectorworks was open (3 versions idling). Using Slack and answering support email tickets via Safari.  <br/>
<br/>
When I returned to make Vision active all I saw was the spinning beachball. Sample process file enclosed. <br/>
<br/>
FYI, I reopened it, went File&gt;Open and the Finder window opened but was totally unresponsive. I had to force quit once more. Second time around the File&gt;Open Finder window opened and worked but was slow and laggy. Select the vsn file, delay for a second or two, click &#39;open&#39; delay for a second or two or three. It feels very unstable on this machine.<br/>

When changing visibility to different states and then clicking &quot;show all&quot; in Solibri does not however lead to any change in Vectorworks.<br/>

By default I would expect Vectorworks to then show all that is also visible in Solibri.

                Mac - Text Format Dialog preview is not WYSIWYG with Shadow style

                                            <td class="description">      See screenshot for an example.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a text object and open Format Text dialog with it selected<br/>
 # Change the size to something like 16 pt and apply the Shadow style<br/>
 # Notice the preview appearance - it typically looks bad because shadow is offset too far making the text illegible.<br/>
 # Apply the changes and notice the text object<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the text object appears like the preview in the dialog<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the text object generally looks better than the preview (smaller shadow offset)<br/>
<br/>
The fix is to make the Format Text dialog&#39;s preview actually use the same shadow rendering technique as the actual text object will use, with the same resulting appearance.

<br/>
On Mac, when you select an item, the highlight will only extend as far as the text of the item label. If the text is short, this can leave a large gap of whitespace. One might expect one could click in this large gap to deselect the item, but that does not actually work (because you are still clicking in the item, it&#39;s just an unused area of the multi-line label). Perhaps the highlight should go to the edge of the actual rectangular cell so the user can see where its edge is, when looking for a place to click to de-select?<br/>
<br/>
On Windows, when you select an item with a long title (normally truncated), it will actually extend to overlap an item below it.  This is probably by-design to solve the problem of additional whitespace, but it looks strange and if the icon of the item underneath is dark it will also obscure the text, making the feature useless.

This looks to be an issue with the content itself and the order the cells were placed in the symbol. I tested a few different Multi Cell LD and they don&#39;t all have this issue.  Also some are ordered differently than others, but still not in the correct order.  Examples of some of these are in the attached vwx file.<br/>
<br/>
Using Manual without the &#39;Single click manual numbering for multi-cell&#39; can be used to correctly number a Multi Cell Lighting Device that have this issue.

After playing around, I learned that the reason for the failure is that my vwx file was located within a folder called &quot;2207 SDC 1/2/3 [S123]&quot;.  When the &quot;/&quot; was removed from the folder name, the xml was created as expected.<br/>
<br/>
While I know it was probably dumb to put &quot;/&quot; in the folder name, I think VW needs to present a dialogue if such a task fails.  Or maybe the task didn&#39;t fail and the file is now floating around in my system hidden somewhere?

                Undo of Wrap text setting does not toggle checkbox in OIP
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is a very minor bug, showing a temporarily inconsistent UI state. Happens on both Windows and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a text block with multi-line text, including a mix of wrapped text and hard newlines.<br/>
 # Double-click in the text box to activate the caret / editing state<br/>
 # In the OIP, click the Wrap text checkbox to turn off text wrapping; the text object will resize<br/>
 # Choose undo / command-Z<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the text wrapping state / size of the text reverts, and the OIP checkbox changes back<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the text wrapping state of the text reverts, but the OIP checkbox remains unchanged<br/>
<br/>
This does not occur if you use the OIP checkbox and undo/redo when the text object is simply selected (not in active edit mode)<br/>
<br/>
After you end editing, esp. after selecting a different object and coming back, the checkbox updates to the correct value to match the object state.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this issue does not happen with other text-related OIP checkboxes; for example if you apply and then undo bold to a word while in editing mode, the OIP bold checkbox will correctly toggle with the undo to match the applied state.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a wrapped multi-line text object<br/>
 # Double-click the object to enter edit mode<br/>
 # Bring up the Font Dialog and repeatedly change the horizontal alignment, e.g. to right, center, left - and/or use the Text-&gt;Alignment menu to do the same<br/>
 # After the last such change (while still in edit mode), try Undo<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: you can undo these several alignment changes<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the changes cannot be undone<br/>
<br/>
NOTE this bug is specific to using the dialog or menu _while in edit mode_. If not in edit mode (with text object merely selected), you can make multiple alignment changes with the dialog or menu, and they are undoable. Also in edit mode, you can make multiple horizontal alignment changes via OIP and undo works in that case.

<br/>
In the Screenshot 2, after the Installation phase is concluded, we can see that &quot;Festplattenvollzugriff erlauben&quot; structure has changed and now the two &quot;ff&quot; have switched to the second line, hence breaking the word and in german this makes no sense.<br/>
<br/>
Please fix the spacing of the left menu, as it does not change when the Installation is concluded.

It often select objects outside of the marquee, which is very frustrating.<br/>

In the attached recording, it seems to mainly be affecting path-based objects, but I&#39;m not sure whether that&#39;s always the case. Notice how the Fence and EAP objects get selected even when nowhere near the selection marquee.

<br/>
This has been a bug since hidden line surface hatches were introduced. It has never been fixed. I reported this in VB-120429. It is not resolved.<br/>
<br/>
In the test file, you&#39;ll see a column, a wall ,and a pillar object.<br/>
<br/>
The texture &quot;Interior Pine Siding RT&quot; has a surface hatch that is oriented in the same direction as the vertical lines of the texture.<br/>
<br/>
Notice for the wall, the texture and the surface hatch are oriented in the same direction.<br/>
<br/>
For the pillar, the surface hatch on the sides is oriented horizontally ie. 90° to the shaded texture.<br/>
<br/>
For the column, the surface hatch is correctly oriented on the column base and is turned 90° on the shaft and capital.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Can we fix this bug? It would sure be great to have the surface hatches behave as expected in all objects.

                Button to say &quot;Exit Mesh&quot; when inside mesh

                                            <td class="description">      Currently when you&#39;re inside a Mesh, the button in the upper right says &quot;Exit Group.&quot; While I understand that a Mesh is essentially a special type of group that contains 3D Polygons, it would be clearer to users if this button said &quot;Exit Mesh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Users will often Group a Mesh in order to avoid accidentally moving individual vertices (i.e. there are 3D Polygons inside of a Mesh inside of a Group). So when you enter the Group the button says &quot;Exit Group&quot; and if you go all the way into the Mesh it should say &quot;Exit Mesh.&quot; As it stands, I sometimes get momentarily confused which &quot;level&quot; I&#39;m in since the buttons both say the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
[The one complication here..... When you&#39;re inside a Mesh, you can select multiple 3D Polygons and &quot;Convert to Mesh&quot; which causes the parent Mesh container to become a true Group, containing the new Mesh and, separately, and remaining 3D Polygons. So this would have to somehow be accounted for.]

I included a video to help show the issue.<br/>
 # Start with a Blank New Document<br/>
 # Activate Stair Tool<br/>
 # Got to Stair Tool Preference button in Tool Bar (or OIP after Stair has been inserted)<br/>
 # Go to Railing Tab<br/>
 # Notice the Parameter windows shows/flashes alone first, then it disappears and everything else on the page fills in.<br/>
 # It take moving the mouse over the Parameter window to make it reappear.<br/>
<br/>
As can be seen towards the end of the video, if the mouse is moved over the window from the side or bottom, the reappearance is spotty, not all at once like from the top.

If the text is longer than the bounding box then the bounding box does not adjust itself to the bigger size.<br/>
Is that a bug or intended.<br/>
I do ask, because if you insert such a symbol inside a wall and the text extend the bandbox and the bounding box would adjust itself automatically, then the hole cut out the wall would grow too, which might be not wanted.<br/>
What do you think? Bug or intended behavior?<br/>

_VerifyValidHandle(toWhom,THIS_FILE,__LINE__,#h,(GSConstHandle)h,bytes)<br/>

the kludge invoked by _VerifyValidHandle returns 307 instead of 0, throwing an assert<br/>

VWTextureShaderBase::GetShaderRecordFamilyAndPrototype will always fail, and thus ::IsShaderRecordObject will always fail, so none of the shader classes function correctly.<br/>

If I change values in the debugger so that VERIFYHANDLE returns TRUE, all code functions as expected.

<br/>
I think the solution to this issue becomes a little complicated as a result of the current functionality.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people suggest that they wanted to scale up via DMX so they could mimic fireworks. I&#39;ve seen people suggest that they wanted to scale down via DMX so they could mimic kabuki drops. I&#39;ve also seen people that want a truss to &quot;disappear&quot;, and so they push it wayyyyy up on the Y axis so it&#39;s &quot;out of view&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We apparently never stopped users from scaling a stick of truss and all of it&#39;s fixtures to zero to make it disappear like they would a firework or a curtain for a kabuki drop. I think we should try to find a way where we can still make fixtures &quot;disappear&quot; or become &quot;not visible&quot; if the parent layer &quot;disappears&quot; or becomes &quot;not visible&quot;. However, we need to approach this solution carefully to avoid breaking backward compatibility with things like DMX XForms.

There&#39;s some strange pane behave when I try to mark position in the list, that were not marked before. Instead of just single click action there&#39;s a need to do some extra click to highlight it first. in fact double click is demanded. It happens only when selecting some position. Deselection doesn&#39;t couse that kind of behave.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open the Image Effects dialog<br/>
<br/>
Note that the preview image appears fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
- Now resize the Bitmap so that its aspect ratio changes<br/>
- Open the Image Effects dialog again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the image is cut-off in the preview window, and if you apply image effects the Bitmap itself will get cut-off.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this problem with un-cropped Bitmaps.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

[i made a movie and now i can&#39;t find the movie on my new hard drive...]<br/>
<br/>
anyway, this happened *every time* I created a new label legend from an existing one. i could edit the label legend resource 2D component and send selected &quot;channel&quot; and &quot;container&quot; to back. but when i opened the edit symbol window, the lighting resource that was active when i created the new label legend is now ADDED to the 2D component window! yowsah!<br/>
<br/>
if i can ever find the movie i&#39;ll add that to this filing. to review: 1] after executing the &quot;create label legend from lighting device&quot; the channel data and container move to the front of the label legend, and 2] the source lighting device 2D component is added to the label legend 2D component edit window. both of these issues should be addressed. thanks.

 # Using the Straight Truss Tool (or Curve Truss Tool), create a piece of truss<br/>
 # With both Truss and Path selected, Go to Edit&gt;Duplicate Along a Path<br/>
 # Put a value in Number of Duplicates (suggest 3-10)<br/>
 # Any of the check boxes can be checked/unchecked<br/>
 # Click Preview<br/>
 # Click OK<br/>
 # Notice the truss quantity multiplied the number of duplicates by itself. (depending on the shape and original placement, the truss might be stacked on top of each other.  check OIP for count if not obvious)<br/>
<br/>
As seen in the video:<br/>
 * When Preview is NOT clicked (skip Step 6), the command runs correctly with the correct quantity and placement.<br/>
 * If Preview is clicked, followed by Cancel, the Previewed truss remains in the drawing space.<br/>
 * If changes are made in the Duplication Along a Path window after click Preview, with objects other than Straight Truss, the Preview clears and needs to be clicked again (Expected Result).  This does not happen with the Straight Truss object, if Preview is clicked again, it reruns the command multiplying the number again by itself.  This can happen even when a change has not been made in the window.<br/>
 * Using Truss from the Truss Tool (Symbols), shows the expected results and works correctly.<br/>

If these classes are not already in the destination document, then there may be no need to control their appearance in the Legend in the destination document, and they may not need to be created.  There may be a lot of them and the user may not like having to delete the ones they don&#39;t want.  (Julian was not expecting them when he cut+pasted).<br/>
<br/>
Viewports experience a similar issue.  Viewports can be copied from one document to another.  Viewport styles may one day be implemented, and introduce the import path for them, like we have for Graphic Legend styles.  The issue of resolving whether the classes are imported may arise with the design of Viewport styles.<br/>
<br/>
We may need a resolver dialog that offers the user a list of classes that would be created as a result of a paste/import and allow them to uncheck the ones they don&#39;t want.  We will need to see what users prefer when they start to work with Legends.<br/>

<br/>
However, if you have the Fillet Edge tool set to &quot;Select Faces,&quot; holding Shift to add to the selection does NOT work. Clicking on a face resets the selection even while holding shift, meaning you have to re-select all the existing faces.<br/>
<br/>
This might be relevant to other features such as chamfer edge and shell, but I only tested on fillets.<br/>

The file contains a few Rectangles with custom pen attributes, some of which are set by-class. It also contains a Graphic Legend that shows the pen attributes and lists Line Type names via dynamic text.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Edit the Class Properties for the viewport<br/>
-Override the pen attributes for one of the classes, using a different Line Type<br/>
-Update the legend<br/>
<br/>
Note that the legend correctly shows the new Line Type image, but the dynamic text still shows the old Line Type name.

A little bug, but a rendered bitmap distorts when pasted onto a sheet layer.<br/>
When pasted as a bitmap, it looks fine. But it would be nice if it worked both ways.<br/>

<br/>
When trying to use the Push/Pull Tool on a rectangle with the Narrow/Normal/Wide Perspective active, it is not possible to select the rectangle and use the Tool at all. This also happens with closed polylines.<br/>
<br/>
If Orthogonal is active, the Push/Pull Tool works correctly.<br/>
<br/>
When using the Oblique Perspectives, I wasn&#39;t also able to select the rectangle like its shown in the video.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be file specific and we couldn&#39;t find what its causing this in the attached file.

notice images render with some strange copy of the rendered bitmap in them, offset in the model. <br/>

Seems like the upgrade to render bitmap tool to generate 3D plane bitmap objects instead of screen-plane bitmap object doesn&#39;t work quite right in perspective views.  Ortho view works better.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an option in Render Bitmap tool to not exclude render-bitmap-generated-bitmap-objects ? hm..<br/>

<br/>
Marker is not centered on top of the line if the length is edited to something higher than the standard 3,175mm. In the video I show with a 50mm length, as that&#39;s the custom wished length by the Customer.<br/>
<br/>
The smaller the length, the less we can notice the Marker shifting its center from the line, but it does clearly shift to the right side. All other options from the Custom Settings seem to work correctly.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
1. Make a multi-line, wrapping text object.<br/>
 2. Select the object; selection tool should still be active.<br/>
 3. In OIP data pane, change Hoirz. Align. to different values several times - it may take 8 or 10 changes to see the issue.<br/>
<br/>
When the issue occurs, you will see the object fail to reflect the new state (e.g. you may change align to Center but it will still show Left, or similar) and also lose the selction outline and/or the selection handles.<br/>
<br/>
When you do something like move the mouse over the drawing area or otherwise prompt a redraw, the issue will be corrected.<br/>
<br/>
This does not occur on Windows.

The hatches in a rotated viewport are not shown right, if the have the property &quot;rotate in wall&quot;. If you zoom an a sheet layer with active accelerate graphics (VW preferences &gt; Display) you can already see the right alignment from the mapping, as it should be.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      This is likely by design, but it is also an inconsistent user experience &amp; a bug.<br/>
<br/>
When you have no text object selected and the selection tool active, you can go to the Text menu and set a style (e.g. Font Style-&gt;Bold), and that style will be active when you then select the text tool and create a text object.<br/>
<br/>
We have keyboard shortcuts for these styles on both Mac and Win - cmd/ctrl-B for bold, cmd-ctrl-I for italic, cmd-ctrl U for underline. These keyboard shortcuts work when you are actively editing text, but they do not work in the scenario described, to set a style as default for a new text object.<br/>
<br/>
At least on Mac the normal behavior for menu items with keyboard shortcuts is to not disassociate them based on context - if a keyboard shortcut works for a menu item in one situation, it should work for that menu item in every situation where the menu item applies, otherwise the lesson to the user is that they can&#39;t rely on the keyboard shortcut.

                                            <td class="description">      When a uniformly styled block of text (or entire text object) is selected, the OIP and the Text menu will reflect applied styles consistently. E.g. if the entire block is bold italic, the bold and italic checkboxes are checked in the OIP, and also in the Text-&gt;Font Style menu.<br/>
<br/>
If a block has words of differently styled text, the program behaves inconsistently. For example, create a text block that has one word bold, and one word italic. If (in edit mode) you put the cursor in the midst of each word or select each word individually, it behaves as expected - bold is checked in the bold word, italic is checked in the italic word.<br/>
<br/>
If you select both words in edit mode, bold is checked (in OIP and in Text-&gt;Font Style menu) but italic is not.<br/>
<br/>
If you end editing with esc, activate selection tool and select the object, the OIP again shows bold as checked but italic not checked, but the Text-&gt;Font Style menu applies three check marks to Bold, Italic, and Plain Text.<br/>
<br/>
There are more inconsistencies that can appear with more combinations of different styles. In some cases I was able to get OIP to display a sort of half-disabled intermediate state for multiple-styled text, but I could not determine the logic, and it did not match Text-&gt;Font Style behavior (which would put checkmarks on multiple items).<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the OIP and Text-&gt;Font Style items are consistent with each other and also reflect intermediate states unambiguously, e.g. by using a dash rather than a checkmark for styles that only apply to part of the selection, permitting the user to make reasonable changes (toggling one style on or off amid multiple styles).

<br/>
Attached is the VWX and MVR files used for this test.  An onPC Lighting Console will be needed for reproducing.  A video &amp; PDF chart has been included to better illustrate.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to open the PDF for review while watching the attached video.  The PDF is a quick chart that breaks down the different effects/values found in the Shutter/Strobe channel and the results seen for GDTF and LIT using the attached test file that is seen in the video.  In the video, the GDTF fixtures are Upstage (higher trim) and the LIT fixtures are Downstage (lower trim).  The fixture tested was Robe 800 LEDWash in mode 1.<br/>

                Vectorworks changes screens after minimizing and restoring
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I just started noticing with 2022 SP3 build 629344 that when Vectorworks is running on an external screen and I minimize it, when restored it will switch to the laptop screen.  In this setup my laptop screen is the main screen, screen 1, and the external monitor is screen 2.  <br/>
<br/>
Screen 1: laptop display, 3840x2400, scaling 250%, set as main display<br/>
<br/>
Screen 2: External monitor, 2560x1440, scaling 125%<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce: <br/>
<br/>
1) Open Vectorworks and have it running on the external monitor.<br/>
<br/>
2) Minimize Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
3) Click on the Vectorworks icon in the system tray, does not matter on which screen.<br/>
<br/>
4) Vectorworks will restore on the laptop screen.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect this might be some sort of graphics driver issue.  All versions of Vectorworks on the laptop now do this, and I can reproduce it with 2021 SP5 as well.  Other apps on the laptop do not exhibit this same behavior though, it seems limited to just Vectorworks.  For example outlook, slack, chrome etc all restore correctly when minimized.

                Parasolid Import and Export: Where is all the data in Vectorworks?

</td>

<br/>
When exporting a parasolid file from TopSolid, we can tell that it comes with a certain structural hierarchy by opening the file in the eDrawings Viewer. From the structural names within the (text) file, we can tell where this information comes from.<br/>
<br/>
When importing the parasolid file in Vectorworks, there is no telling where the information is stored: objects have no names and record formats don&#39;t exist. But we know information is conserved, because 1) there are nested groups within the model group and 2) when we export the model back to X_T and open the file in eDrawings again, we can see parts of the information remained in the model, but the structure is flattened all throughout the model.<br/>
<br/>
This leaves us with two issues:<br/>
a) Where is the information stored within Vectorworks and why can we not access, read and change it?<br/>
b) Why is Vectorworks not able to export the model with the same hierarchy it was imported or a hierarchy that can be configured by nesting groups?

 <br/>
<br/>
I have converted a VWX file from 2019 to the 2022 version. <br/>
I have exported the &quot; Saal&quot; layer - as MVR (see screenshot).<br/>
Only the active elements when opening the file &quot; 20221029_Sparkassengala Duisburg_Raumplan_v1.3 v2022 &quot; were exported.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I import this MVR again Vectorworks becomes extremely slow.<br/>
<br/>
The memory is nearly full. See screenshot<br/>
<br/>
What can we do here ?<br/>

However we try to support them as good as we can. At the Moment their biggest problem is instability. Beside that they try to continue some workflows they had with the old CAD and there it was the daily business, to reshape 2D Drawings. <br/>
It would be possible to reorganize the drawing, making symbols, connect single lines to polylines etc. Also hiding unwanted Objects etc. <br/>
Through the eyes of those users it just like Vectorworks can&#39;t handle the same drawing as the other CAD Applications. And I must agree, 3000 Selected Objects and 30&#39;000 overall visible Objects should not bring Vectorworks go down in the knees. OK so far to join in that it is a workaround but not a good option to just reorganize the drawing till it works.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks 2015 takes about 3 seconds to reshape the drawing. Vectorworks 2023 needs over 100 Seconds for the same action which looks pretty the same. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a specific issue with the selection highlighting option. Even if there are just 200 objects selected it is very laggy. That brings me to the suspicion, that there could be a Bug in the reshape tool. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it could be  a pragmatic solution, to track the amount of objects and then deactivate the selection highlighting in the tool temporary? <br/>
<br/>
I know it is not a 100% Bug it is more a downgrade of speed. But in 2019 it is the same speed. We have to go back many years (2015 or 2016) to see, that there was a time it worked faster.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very glad, if you could take a look at this issue. Thank you<br/>

The problem is in function {*}CClosingOperation::CloseContourOnBoundary(){*}. More specifically functions *VWPolygon2D::IsPtOnPoly2D_Fast* and *VWPolygon3D::GetPlanarPolygon* are slow because they are called many times due to the fact that the boundary of the site model has ~3000 points.

<br/>
We have decided to mark this as QRT, because of slow performance and memory leak of a file that contains Spotlight objects and we are close to an Update (SP3.1) that has to do with Spotlight. Maybe this is worth to take a look and see if a fix / improvement can be included in such Update.<br/>
<br/>
After opening the attached Vectorworks file and updating the Viewports that are in the file, we can see that the RAM in use increases significantly and does not go down after the Viewports being updated.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, if we navigate the file (zoom, pan, etc.) the file drags a lot and the objects disappear and take a long time to reload. The memory also went up a notch again.

The problem is related to the creation of unique DXF block names (there are around 15000 IFC Entity objects). We have optimized the routine for Group objects, when groups are exported as named blocks, but we might need a more general solution.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have received a file form a user complaining that the site model is very slow to work with. I have noticed that navigating through the file seems to take long sometimes but just trying to do anything with the site model itself like updating it takes a very long time. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The model is created out of about 40 stakes and does not seem to be too complicated. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I tried to copy the site model into a new file and it took quite long to paste it in. But seems to be very responsive when i update it in an empty file. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Could this be an issue with the site model having trouble with complex site modifiers or generally the site modifiers used are overly complicated? User mentioned that this was working better in 2022, but i find in most of the situations users will say that when they might not have had such complex site modifiers in 2022. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Sorry for not purging the file i thought it will just make more sense to see the whole thing just to have the same experience as the user.

it is not uncommon to have about 100 doors in a drawing. The doors are labelled by data tag. This works pretty fine and is very fast.<br/>
But the moment the data tag writes data back to the assigned object, things do become very slow. See video.<br/>
I do log this as a bug, because I think the data tag becomes more and more important.<br/>
Tested also in latest 28.0.1.<br/>
There are two testifies. One with a regular data tag (100 US-Türen mit Datenstempel) which is pretty fast and one which writes data back to the object (100 US-Türen mit Datenstempel und Datenverknüpfung Tür) which is beyond slow.<br/>

When using the Move Tool, there is a visible delay after performing the second click for the wished location of the object. This delay is even more visible with Windows.<br/>
<br/>
Attached are two videos, one with Mac and another with Windows. The Customer complains about a general slow performance of the file, while testing I have noticed that is more obvious when moving objects, sometimes while using zoom / pan / drag with Windows, but mostly when moving objects with the Move Tool.

                Mac: Graphic Legends progress dialog and work on main thread kills event loop
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      On a complex file with graphic legends - such that making a change to recalculate will bring up a progress dialog - the dialog which comes up is implemented poorly in terms of event-handling and multi-tasking on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, even though the progress dialog appears to be non-modal, it will block many user-invoked actions from completing and can also cause very awkward/non-professional looking UI behaviors such as disappearing or stuck menu items.<br/>
<br/>
This is the general issue which caused ModeBar-branch bug VB-191129. A workaround has been implemented for that bug, but the general issue remains.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Open the attached file.<br/>
 # Select the graphic legends object in the active Sht-11 layer.<br/>
 # Make a change that triggers the re-generation of the graphic legends such as changing the dimension font size via *Text-&gt;Size* menu item<br/>
 # While the progress dialog is regenerating the graphic legends, attempt to click on menu items and carry out other commands. (Specific items are mentioned below)<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the menus show, with available items enabled and others disabled; clicking on an enabled item correctly invokes its behavior<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the menu items sometimes do not show when you click them; when they do, they may go away as you move the mouse around, which makes the program seem very glitchy; when you succeed in choosing a menu command, it does not actually do anything.<br/>
<br/>
SPECIFIC ENABLED COMMAND FAILURES:<br/>
<br/>
*File-&gt;New, Open, Save As..., Project Sharing, Print* etc. are enabled, but selecting during progress dialog does nothing<br/>
<br/>
{*}Edit-&gt;Cut, Copy, Undo, Redo{*}, etc. are enabled, but selecting during progress dialog does nothing<br/>
<br/>
*View-&gt;* has many enabled items which do not produce any action, including {*}Zoom{*}, {*}Class Options{*}, {*}Look at Working Plane{*}, *Create Multiple Viewports...,* {*}Save View{*}..., ** etc.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every other menu also has items enabled that will do nothing: {*}Modify{*}, {*}Model{*}, {*}Tools{*}, {*}Text{*}, {*}Window{*}, and *Help.*<br/>
<br/>
RECOMMENDATION: the easiest fix may be to make the progress dialog an actual modal which prevents interaction with the rest of the app until it&#39;s done; this is what we&#39;re actually doing, so this would resolve much of the appearance of glitchiness and unresponsiveness. Presumably the modal state will actually disable most menu items which are currently left enabled.<br/>
<br/>
*A better fix,* recommended for the future, is to rewrite the way that we do this task and show this progress dialog. I think TProgressDialog&#39;s {{{}*DoYield*{}}}() approach to multi-tasking is fundamentally outdated and incompatible with the Mac OS event loop. All this work is done on the main thread, including the synchronous updating of the progress dialog, with DoYield() permitting occasional idle event processing; this is backward. The progress dialog should get asynchronous notifications to update its progress display, not get synchronously updated on the mani thread, and the main rendering work should not happen on the main thread. The menu items that cannot be invoked while this process is underway should be disabled; any enabled item should still trigger its expected behavior.<br/>

<br/>
Comparative Testing: <br/>
<br/>
Importing same PDF with lots of geometry into: <br/>
 * Vectorworks 2020 = 14 seconds<br/>
 * Vectorworks 2021 = 12 seconds<br/>
 * Vectorworks 2022 = 42 seconds<br/>
 * Vectorworks 2023 = 45 seconds<br/>
<br/>
This issue became apparent while examining and testing a customer&#39;s file to identify and report what opportunities they have to improve their efficiency with Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
At first I thought the problem only occurred when opening their file which had 16 embedded and cropped PDFs with quite a lot of geometry, but then I noticed similarly long delays when importing PDFs into a file new blank document and similarly long delays when switching _back_ to any of their Design Layers that had embedded PDFs so perhaps the issue might relate to either the process of interpretation or displaying PDFs. Then again, their file at times induces 27 GB or RAM on my 16 GB Mac, so perhaps the delay when switching Design Layers was due to memory handling processes. <br/>
<br/>
*The bottom line is;* Importing PDFs (perhaps only those that have geometry in them) takes _*four*_ _times longer in VW2023 and VW2022, than in VW2021 and VW2020._ Something to look at here for sure! <br/>

On my Mac in Debug it takes ~2.5 minutes for the information to appear.<br/>

Time profiling shows the majority of time is spent in CExtObjectHardscapeShapePane::Activate.<br/>

I understand that algorithm which collects the information for OIP contributes to the problem - we call TParametricTypeController::UpdateWidgets for each selected object and it takes time.<br/>

The purpose of this bug is to investigate if some optimization can be done in CExtObjectHardscapeShapePane::Activate

The viewport in the attached test file takes at least 20 mins to render in Hidden line. After rendering, try to zoom using the mouse wheel. Notice this operation is a bit slow.<br/>

The viewport has lots of geometry ; however, the laptop has 64 Gb RAM so I would&#39;ve expected fast zoom operations. <br/>

The Customer complains that her Macbook M1 freezes and has to terminate Vectorworks, when updating the Section Viewport 1/1 that is shown in the video.<br/>
<br/>
I could not reproduce such a freeze, but when updating the said Section  Viewport, we can see that the RAM is increased to 8,4 GB RAM and it stays in such value even after the update is done (VW does briefly freeze). VW does use immediately about 4GB RAM since the file is open.<br/>
<br/>
The Logs sent by the Customer do not seem to have anything relevant to help find a reason for this, but I have attached them anyway in case I have missed something.<br/>

<br/>
I have this File here with a bigger delay with caching the graphics for loading the crop from viewport.<br/>
It makes a big difference if you load the crop with active accelerate graphics or not. I stopped the time and get this two results:<br/>
active accelerate graphics: *±00:18.47s*<br/>
inactive accelerate graphics: *±00:01.68*<br/>
(The values given are mean values from several test runs)<br/>
<br/>
This results in a delay of 999.4% to the stopped 18.47s.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped also the time, when the two options for the crop are inactive and also with active accelerate graphics.<br/>
The time was *±05.76s*. The delay to 18.47s is here 220.66%<br/>
This workflow is used by the customer and currently provides satisfaction. However, they hope that this process can still be accelerated significantly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached the file. As well as a screen record, that shows the three progresses.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Denis<br/>

Retesting Spell Check in this file in Vectorworks 2023 Build 662280 as well as Vectorworks 2022 SP4 Build 653494 &amp; SP3 Build 646432.  Both experience a hang when Change All is selected (hang for Change is usually less significant).  If let sit, the Vectorworks seems to eventually come out of it, but some times takes up to 30 minutes.<br/>

Tested Vectorworks 2021 SP3 Build 588748 and this performs much better, like VW2020 SP3.<br/>

-Open test file and go to an isometric view - make sure the drawing is rendered in shaded ( set &#39;Default 3D View Render Mode to &quot;Shaded&quot; if necessary)<br/>

I noticed the &#39;geometry&#39; progress bar when the layer is activated. Maybe this is what is causing the delay for the PDFs to appear?

<br/>
I attached a customer file with the problem, that the graphic of geometries are shown in an offset to the to the real object after a zoom in/out when the image structure is recalculated.<br/>
I was able to reduce the cause to the layers &quot;Partnerinnen-Bereich&quot; and &quot;Backstage&quot;. Are these layers invisible, the image structure is correct.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing.<br/>

<br/>
To test, open a new document.<br/>
<br/>
Place an array and select the bumper and various random speakers from the generic offerings. Populate the array via the Populate Array button in the OIP. Notice the speed.<br/>
<br/>
Place another array and this time choose symbol based objects for the bumper and speakers. Populate again. This time around it should take much longer to complete the task.<br/>
<br/>
Next, move each array set around the drawing. The generics move much faster than the symbol based.<br/>
<br/>
Our user are going to want to use our extensive libraries of symbols rather than generic shapes. Speed is critical and performance should be similar between the two.<br/>
<br/>
Demo file attached. To immediately see my results, simple move each array and compare the about of time it takes.<br/>
The generic array takes 1.2 seconds to move. The symbol based version takes 35 full seconds to move.

What happens is I&#39;ll be working on modeling a design, and navigation will be smooth and responsive – then at some point navigation becomes very slow and sluggish, seemingly unrelated to model complexity. I&#39;m not sure what triggers this change. Today it happened quite suddenly after simply adding a few extrudes to the model.<br/>
<br/>
The issue seems to only affect navigation with the SpaceMouse, as using the regular Flyover tool still works fine.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, closing and restarting Vectorworks doesn&#39;t solve the issue. I have to completely restart my computer, then navigation is once again smooth and responsive.<br/>
<br/>
This issue doesn&#39;t seem related to any particular file or action, so I&#39;m not sure how to add better documentation to this entry, but I wanted to file it anyways. The motivation for filing this today is that I started a brand new file this morning for a new design, and around 2p the slow navigation suddenly began. This was also the first time I confirmed my suspicion that it takes a computer reset to fix the issue.

The issue seems to be related to having Favorite files in the RM. If I temporarily remove all my Favorites from my User Folder then restart Vectorworks, Resource Selectors pop up in under a second. But when I bring my Favorites back the delay returns.<br/>

The delay is present on ALL Resource Selectors in various tools/contexts.<br/>

As part of their workflow they create repetitive flat units as Symbols. They also model custom Doors and Windows as Symbols then either insert directly into Walls or create Door and Window object using Symbol Geometry.<br/>
<br/>
See attached screen recording and files - once IFC is exported, these symbols don&#39;t keep their position, but explode to random locations (possibly Symbol and Project Origin). Only way to keep them where they should be is to attach IFC to Flat symbol at top level, but that means no objects within can be individually queried in the BIM model.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need further information or clarification. I have a customer that is stuck with their IFC exchange and would appreciate some feedback.<br/>

<br/>
If you plot the values returned from these calls back to the implied origin it can be seen that the &quot;Faux Origin&quot; is rotated twice the distance as the plan rotation angle.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached file, the plan angle is 10°, but the ModelVecToScreenVec(), and ModelPt2DToScreenPt() calls are returning values as if the plan angle is rotated 20°.<br/>
<br/>
These errors only occur when the Plan is rotated AND there is an offset to the User Origin. If the User Origin is NOT moved, or the Plan is NOT rotated, the calls work correctly in all VW versions.<br/>
<br/>
It is also assumed, but not proven that the inverse calls ScreenVecToModelVec() and ScreenPtToModelPt2D() also have problems. Please verify that these calls execute properly in Rotated Plan View with and without a shifted User Origin.<br/>

I&#39;ve attached a screen recording when this happened.<br/>
<br/>
I can navigate on 1 drawing but when I switch to one of the other open drawings I can&#39;t navigate them. When I zoom in and out, for example in the first file, its zooming in and out of the third file which I&#39;ve not selected. Similar behaviour with panning.<br/>

Steps to reproduce the problem:<br/>

IFC4 become more and more popular though there is no certification.

<br/>
I had not realised that GUIDs are still not automatically created for all object types upon their creation. (eg objects such as Walls, Slabs Stairs do get GUID assigned to them upon creation, whilst Windows, Doors, Beams and Columns do not). Is this something that can be fixed?<br/>

For some reason the Pset field IfcWallCommon.ThermalTransmittance exports anything but what is written in the field formula.

<br/>
Here is the description of the behavior:<br/>
<br/>
. a multilayer wall is to be exported to Ifc-format using the &quot;Export Separate Instances&quot; option.<br/>
<br/>
. in this case each wall layer creating an own opening (IfcOpeningElement) per object (window/door)<br/>
<br/>
. The multiple openings (IfcOpeningElements) have the same GUID per object in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
. This leads to irritation and miscalculations in planning<br/>
<br/>
Question:<br/>
<br/>
Is the behavior correct and BIM compliant?<br/>
Or is it a BUG?<br/>
<br/>
Can you please suggest an workaround?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For a better overview, please have a look at the video and the files in the attachment.

We have a serious problem exporting this project in IFC format.<br/>
When you open in Solibri, all the building geometry becomes black and some objects are placed on the ground - see attached images.<br/>
Could you please let us know if this are a Vectorworks problems or there is a way to fix the model?<br/>
 <br/>
It is really important for us to know if those problems could be addressed soon, because this client needs to provide the IFC model to the contractor.<br/>

You can download the Vectorworks file and the corresponding IFC one from this link:<br/>

A story that once existed in this document is still present in the IFC-Export dialog on the Layer Mapping tab. (see image &#39;IFC-Export-Layer-Mapping.png&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
And while it&#39;s not part of the current story structure, (see image &#39;Stories.png&#39;), it is still being exported to IFC. (see image &#39;BIMcollabZOOM.png&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
Usually an empty IfcStory wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but maybe something else is borked in the IFC export with this particular file. I cannot tell.

Dominique:<br/>
https://analytics.vectorworks.net/crashes?serial=EHXNWN-0Z031S-EB2TYS-Z00508<br/>
<br/>
Since about one or two year, we hear often about crashes related to some (random) dlls like kernelbase.dll, libcef.dll, BCGCBRO3060u141.dll and others. They are all on Vectorworks 2022 or 2021. <br/>
<br/>
Also in some cases there is an error Message &quot;Encountered an improper&quot; or &quot;Eine Resource konnte nicht gefunden werden&quot;. A low-level Windows Messages. Related to driver or system Resources? Normally we can wait and since a Windows Update, Driver Update VW Update those reports gone away. <br/>
<br/>
In this case we still hear often about this crashes. Now we have an import customer for us which have some issues and the main issue is, that they have 4-7 crashes a day they work with Vectorworks. I guess it must be related to some kind of geometry in their Drawings but it is very hard to reproduce. Well I can &quot;reproduce&quot; the crashes in a statistic way like this: <br/>
1. Open File &quot;Layout Blättern Crash&quot; <br/>
2. Open 4 additional Documents (Architectural Template in the International Version) <br/>
3. Turning the Modell in &quot;Layout Blättern ....vwx&quot; in Solid and Wireframe <br/>
4. Switching the Layouts in one of the templates by using ctrl arrow up and down 5. Do the same in &quot;Layout Blättern ....vwx&quot; <br/>
6. Repeat, here I have crashes every 10-20 Minute when I &quot;work&quot; on this like explained above.<br/>
<br/>
Attached some movies with crashes. The best to see is maybe &quot;Crash 1503&quot;. The number is the Time here. The crash is always at the end of the movies. I know this Tests looks rude against Vectorworks but the users can &quot;reproduce&quot; those crashes by:<br/>
1. switching Documents, <br/>
2. open Documents, <br/>
3. switching to layout, <br/>
4. just do noting or edit the drawing <br/>
5. Exit Dialoges<br/>
and being more friendly to Vectorworks than me in my test. <br/>
<br/>
We have really a lot reports from windows customers about similar crashes. It would be very important to be able to target those crashes, we really hope you are able to help and to analyze some known issue or be able to profile and reproduce those crashes on you own machines and would be able to give us some feedback.<br/>
<br/>
The customer also switched on the detailed log now. Also I am able to reproduce it similar like the customer.<br/>

<br/>
When the Partner Services&#39; website facility, &#39;License Session History&#39; shows many successive lines showing only &#39;Begin Session&#39; actions and zero &#39;End Session&#39; actions, one imagines the user concerned is either experiencing many, many crashes or is using &#39;End Task&#39; or &#39;Force Quit&#39; a crazy number of times. But there are probably other things that can cause successive &#39;Begin Session&#39; actions, such as: <br/>
* The internet being unavailable when Vectorworks is quit, but is (strangely) available only when it is opened. (Which is _super_ unlikely in any case). <br/>
* The Vectorworks License Session History server being unavailable, again coincidentally only during End Sessions. <br/>
* I cannot think of any other reasons…<br/>
<br/>
*So my question is:* <br/>
Can we rely on successive &#39;Begin Session&#39; actions in the License Session History page as an indication of how frequently Vectorworks is _either_ crashing or being force quit?

I sent them a screenshot and a simple IFC test file. (I&#39;m attaching everything here).<br/>
<br/>
In their last email they told me this:<br/>
{quote}Our development team has informed us of the following:<br/>
 <br/>
Some BIM programs export IFC files in wrong ways regarding spaces.<br/>
When this happens, every space will be related to the building story container twice. Once through IFCRELAGGREGATES and another through IFCRELCONTAINEDINSPATIALSTRUCTURE.{quote}<br/>
and attached a screenshot showing the double relation.<br/>
<br/>
The email continues like this:<br/>
{quote}{color:#000000}BIMcollab ZOOM handles these badly exported IFC&#39;s by making sure that the geometry of the IfcSpace is not duplicated in the model, but unfortunately, removing the double space from the navigator is not something very obvious to do.{color}<br/>
 <br/>
{color:#000000}In any case, our development team has reported the problem in the ZOOM backlog and will work towards improving this in a future release.{color}{quote}<br/>
I had to make new files, because I couldn&#39;t find the old ones. But you can see the same issue.

<br/>
It seems, that if we have a sub-object inside a PIO, which is defined as an IFC Object which is a Symbol, it is exported as its Coordinates of the PIO internal Plane instead of the World coord system.<br/>
<br/>
I was not able to find another PIO which contains symbols to test, if this is a general behavior<br/>
Also unclear and what would happen, if the sub-objects of the PIO would get different IFC Types or Informations. <br/>

<br/>
The new button &quot;(object) Data...&quot; opens the dialog titled &quot;(object) Data&quot; and changing information there will always change this information for all selected wall instances only.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when editing the &quot;(object) Style&quot; - like the wall, making changes to the data will overwrite all Data set in &quot;Wall Data&quot; dialogs for wall instances, if the user ticked the checkbox &quot;Replace Data&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I know many customers have all or at least most checkboxes ticked by default, when working with walls. And as such making changes to the Wall Style equals making changes to all Wall instances with this style.<br/>
<br/>
This can lead to quite some confusion within teams, when expectations of what certain buttons do are not what happens in reality.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the dialog title to &quot;Edit (object) Instance Data&quot; for example would be a great way towards avoiding confusion about what this button actually does.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that the button could be grayed out if set by style (that would require a toggle within the style dialog). Or you could get a warning that says &quot;You are about to edit style based Data.&quot; or the opposite if the current logic remains.<br/>
<br/>
Food for though.

When exporting a referenced viewport as IFC, the wall components are missing, if they are linked to a story. It is so that the components are not present in the viewer at all. However, if the individual components have a relative value to the wall with an additional manual offset, they are exported correctly.<br/>

The attached video describes well the problem. We can see that the User has difficulties to Snap objects (eg. group objects) and there are &quot;hick-ups&quot; (graphical difficulties) while trying to drag, edit, snap the objects in the drawing.<br/>

<br/>
However, when I created the Landmark UK BIM template, I turned off the page breaks and the watermarks, turned on the grid, and set it to A1 (landscape).<br/>
<br/>
If I open a new version of it from a new build in 2023, it opens with page breaks on, and the A1 size is not ticked in the dialogue box. If I then adjust these settings in the Document Settings, close the file and open a new one from the same template, it now has the correct settings. It seems like the settings you manually set up becomes a Vectorworks preference instead of a document preference.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t happen with all the settings - units, for example, seem to stay as set up in the template.<br/>
<br/>
This is making me a bit confused - what is actually part of the Document settings and what&#39;s not?

In 2022 using the dimension class, if dimensions are placed the text and lines are the same color. With dimension tape, the text will stay black and not take on the dimension class color.<br/>

I have tried also doing the above steps with a new blank file in 2022 and 2023 Beta, and in both of those cases the dimension tape stays black.  Open the 2021 file in 2023 results in the same issue above.

For example.  A.03 on the room schedule shows 17,45x17,43 and I have attached a screen shot showing how that dimension is derived.  <br/>

As a work around I explained the user would have to return to top plan and physically rotate his design, or manually input the space dimensions in each space settings.

The witness lines are not displayed as expected in the Viewport. The Viewport scale seems to be correct and we don&#39;t find a reason for this, please take a look.<br/>
<br/>
Like its shown in the video, the vertical witness lines are displayed too big in the Viewport compared to the Design Layer and the diagonal witness lines too small compared to the Design Layer. When going in the Viewport Edit Mode and putting on and off the OI arrow inside option, refreshes the witness lines causing the vertical ones to get smaller. Now we have both vertical and diagonal witness lines too small in the Viewport, compared to the drawing. Why? Thank you in advance.

<br/>
As example, some numbers of the two dimensions are marked with a red square, to make easier to compare the size between numbers.<br/>
<br/>
The red square is showing the size of the number 7, when using the red square again in other numbers (keeping the square height), we can see that the 5 and 0 are bigger than the 7, plus the 3 and 8 are smaller in the dimension below than the 7.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look why the numbers do not have all the same size, despite the settings are exactly the same and if possibly create a fix.

<br/>
Currently, it is possible to generate PDFs from within the cloud. But there is a big difference (advantage!) when it comes to measurements if the PDF creation is triggered through the Nomad app or in the cloud portal / publish command in Vectorworks.<br/>
 * From the cloud: The scale can be read and snaps are detected for correct measurements<br/>
 * Trough the VCS portal (in browser): The measurements in VCS have to be done without snapping and the scale needs to be calculated manually from the sheet layer scale (e.g. in millimeters).<br/>
 * Publish (in VW): The measurements in VCS have to be done without snapping and the scale needs to be calculated manually from the sheet layer scale (e.g. in millimeters).<br/>
<br/>
Of course the user would expect the snaps and scale detection in every PDF.

guess this is not really a bug but more like a question about a behavior on windows PC.<br/>
When you draw a simple geometry like a rectangle or line, then the Vectorworks symbol in Windows taskline gets doubled.<br/>
If you go to the taskline settings and ungroup all the symbols then you can see it better.<br/>
Is this a bug? Or something related to Windows? What&#39;s the explanation I can pass to our customers?<br/>
See video.<br/>

What have been done until now:<br/>
1. PRAM, SCM reset<br/>
2. Disconnect all external devises except Keyboard/Mouse<br/>
3. New User<br/>
4. Disabled all non-standard-fonts<br/>
<br/>
We told, that kind of issue is typical for corrupted hardware or driver issues which is triggered by Vectorworks because the use of Graphic Engine or a cache RAM which is not used without Vectorworks. But I am not sure. Do you ever heard about that issue or have a solution?<br/>

Both seem to use the Line start point and line end point markers as part of the relevant geometry.<br/>
The problem only seems to be on Mac, I can&#39;t replicate it using windows 10 and seems to be specific to 2022.<br/>
[~jwoodward] is experiencing the issue on the cable object side, constantly<br/>
and the forum thread linked below seems to be experiencing the same issue with the hoist measurement label. <br/>
 [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/92022-hoist-data-display/]<br/>
<br/>
I have also spoken with [~jvanhassel] who has seen this intermittently with cable objects as well, he has suggested it may be Mac Os related<br/>
<br/>
The problem in both cases makes it almost impossible to work the affected object size the markers are so big that they obscure important details and any attached objects.

Users expect that all objects above the cutting plane will be rendered the same way. If the &quot;include hidden lines&quot; is off, I should only see top outline.

<br/>
One would expect the text to apply to ALL selected viewports, since that&#39;s how fields typically work when multiple objects are selected.<br/>
<br/>
Drawing Title is not a unique field (like Drawing Number is), so there&#39;s no reason that the entered text shouldn&#39;t apply to the entire selection.<br/>
<br/>
As an example of why this is a problem, within my industry it&#39;s common for a sheet to have up to two dozen elevations, all with a unique Drawing Number [we actually use a letter] but they all have the same Drawing Title — simply &quot;Elevation&quot;. It should be fast and easy to select all of them and type this in, but as it stands, I have to enter the title individually for every single viewport. This wastes a lot of time when I&#39;m creating dozens of elevations per week.

                In recent VW versions, locked objects cannot be duplicated and moved (Opt-Click-drag), so why are they duplicated in place?
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In VW 2018, the behavior of duplicating locked objects changed. In VW 2017 and earlier a user could select objects, some, or all of which may be locked, and Opt-Click-drag them to a new position. All selected objects would be duplicated and moved, including the locked objects. Upon duplication, no duplicates would be locked.<br/>
<br/>
From VW 2018 to the present, Opt-Click-drag duplicates all selected objects but only moves the unlocked ones. Additionally, the duplicated locked object(s) remain locked, whereas in earlier versions duplicates of locked objects were created unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
This is a significant change to a very long history of VW behavior and one with a significant unwanted side effect. If locked objects cannot be moved on duplication, why are they even duplicated?<br/>
<br/>
Copy and Paste of locked objects still works as it always has. Locked objects can be copied as part of a selection and pasted in a new location and the copies of locked objects are not locked upon pasting. In my opinion, Opt-Click-drag should work the same way.<br/>
<br/>
See the video Mark Doubleday posted in this thread [VB-185298: Locked objects Duplicate with the Move by Points tool|[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/92601-jira-vb-185298-locked-objects-duplicate-with-the-move-by-points-tool-mark-doubleday/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=421332]]<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Cmd-D, the keyboard shortcut to &quot;duplicate selected objects&quot; suffers the same behavior as Opt-Click-drag when VW Pref &quot;Offset duplications&quot; is enabled. Unlocked objects are duplicated and shifted, but locked objects are duplicated in place. This defeats the preference&#39;s setting of shifting duplicated objects.<br/>
<br/>
In all, I think this is a regression. To me, the locked attribute does not imply that a locked object is off limits to duplication. It just states that the locked object cannot have its attributes or position changed without first unlocking it.<br/>
<br/>
To see the effect:<br/>
<br/>
1) Draw 3 rectangles.<br/>
<br/>
2) Lock one of them.<br/>
<br/>
3) Select them all.<br/>
<br/>
4) Option-Click-drag the selection to a new location.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2018 to the present, only the unlocked objects are moved, but the locked object was duplicated and remains in place. Note the OIP shows 3 objects selected.<br/>
<br/>
5) Select All.<br/>
<br/>
Note in the OIP there are now 6 objects selected which indicates the locked object was definitely duplicated. <br/>
<br/>
In VW 2017 and earlier, all selected objects are duplicated and moved. This should be the desired behavior.<br/>

When creating a viewport on a sheet layer, there is a white object, an old deleted garden bed that keeps appearing, can&#39;t click it, can&#39;t force select, it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not there, like a ghost. <br/>

Kosta and Aleksandar, this goes back to our discussion in late December and early January about &#39;flipping&#39; markers. For simple markers (those that do not involve concatenated text), the behavior we have implemented is fine and correct. But when the user has complex markers, the text can read backwards and be confusing (for example, &quot;3.25m + Second Story&quot; instead of &quot;Second Story + 3.25m&quot;). There are two possible solutions:<br/>
 # automatically determine concatenated text and draw the text blocks from left to right always (I think this will be difficult and troublesome); OR<br/>
 # provide a contextual &quot;Flip Elevation Benchmark&quot; command that will flip the EB graphics around the insertion point and leave all the leader lines in place. (I think this will be easier and allow the user to always get what they want, even if they have to take an additional step.)<br/>

&quot;Hi Jeroen,<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this is a possible bug that has been submitted recently, but our engineering team has not been able to reproduce. It might be related to the PDF Viewer or Reader that is being used. Can you submit this as a bug on JIRA so our engineering team can follow up with you directly?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Unless you attempt to reference a database row cell. VW won&#39;t do it. I don&#39;t see why not. There&#39;s no calculations involved, just a request to copy the contents of 1 cell into another worksheet.

* We repaired his installation... After logging in (login succeeds), he gets the message he&#39;s not part of the VSS program.<br/>
* The customer checked his Vectorworks Preferences, but his preferences lack the ability to check the &#39;Enable Premium Libraries&#39; box.<br/>

For some reason, this customer has 3 VSS contracts assigned to his account. We wonder if that could be the cause of this issue, or something else?<br/>

I believe there is something wrong with the attached PDF, but perhaps VW can figure out what and work around it.<br/>
<br/>
When the PDF is imported into VW2022 and zoomed in and out of a few times it causes a hard crash to the desktop. Mac OS does not recognize that VW has crashed for several minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Import (I used a drag) the PDF into a blank VW file.  Zoom in. Notice that the lines show anti-aliasing rather than being smooth vector lines. They show as smooth lines in Preview.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Zoom in and out a few times and VW should crash.

-Launch VW , draw two rectangles and select them both<br/>
<br/>
-From the OIP, toggle the &#39;Next Object in Selection&#39; and &#39;Previous Object in Selection&#39; several times then on the last click, keep pressing the button and move to cursor on the Rectangle with no red highlighting<br/>
<br/>
-Click on it<br/>
<br/>
-Notice the red highlighting stays on the other rectangle. Even deselecting both rectangles keeps the red highlighting visible.<br/>
<br/>
(You may have to try this more than one time to see the problem - see movie for details)<br/>

I see this behavior in VW2022 as well. <br/>

The IT guy told me, that their security is very tight and prevents any unauthorized software to even start.

<br/>
Hello!  <br/>
 <br/>
I’m working with Dave (cc’d) on an issue with activating Vectorworks 2023. <br/>
 <br/>
We have our license server at swe-licserv-vectorworks.g.apple.com, port 5053. We’re observing that Vectorworks 2023 does not activate unless you also have Vectorworks 2022 installed on the machine. <br/>
 <br/>
If you attempt to license Vectorworks 2023 without 2022 installed, we’re observing that the app tries to talk to an API at activation.vectorworks.net, which then redirects to api-load-balancer-public-18656393.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com, but then something happens and the app fails to activate. It never gets to the point of attempting to contact our license server, per the macOS logs. <br/>
 <br/>
We’re observing that the issue goes away if you install Vectorworks 2022 and check out the license from that app. <br/>
 <br/>
Are there any known issues that sound like this? What logs could we provide to help with the investigation? <br/>
<br/>
Additional info:<br/>
Apple allows calling outside hosts so that&#39;s not what the problem is from what I can tell since once I install 2022 it works fine connecting to the same license server.  <br/>

Early in the translation phase, you should hit the HandleObjectInheritanceError() function DSTOP, which occurs when it seems to think it is translating an old-style round wall but the tdType in the object is 0.

This does not seem to have any effect on the resulting file.

<br/>
1) On the Vectorworks 2023 System Requirement, it says &quot;Vectorworks runs successfully within remote and virtualized environments.&quot; in &quot;Remote and Virtualized Environments&quot; section.<br/>
Does this mention include the Series G?<br/>
<br/>
2) Until VW2022, License Files were issued as &quot;Virtual Machine Use: No&quot;, unless ordered.<br/>
If the Series G runs on virtualized environments normally, from now on VW2023, will every License File be issued as &quot;Virtual Machine Use: Yes&quot; by default?<br/>
<br/>
Please reply urgently.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce, open the attached file and look at the multi-line text objects in Layer 3. The OIP shows that they are single-spaced, but they appear to be drawn with larger spacing (about 1.5). However the selection bounding box is drawn at the size they would be if single-spaced. Also, the background color is not drawn to the same area as the text, but is only drawn under the bounding selection box.<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Section Viewport that displays a building model. The file includes a layer named &quot;Main Floor-Furniture&quot; that has a bunch of mesh-based Symbols from default content. This layer is set to invisible in the Section Viewport.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Update the SVP and then enter its Section In-Place mode<br/>
<br/>
Note that it takes about 45 seconds for the section and render to complete.<br/>
<br/>
- Now close the file without saving, then reopen it<br/>
- Delete the &quot;Main Floor-Furniture&quot; layer<br/>
- Update the SVP and enter its Section In-Place mode again<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it only takes a few seconds, so it looks like VW is doing some kind of calculations for all the invisible objects on the &quot;Main Floor-Furniture&quot; layer. However, in the first scenario, if you manually make the &quot;Main Floor-Furniture&quot; layer visible after entering the in-place edit mode, it still goes through another long update phase.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happens in past versions.

The current workaround is to address the web interface via IP and not via domain name or FQDN. This is problematic in large networks.

<br/>
We have a user: &quot;genesiscm&quot; who submitted an animation. It has timed out even though there is 1 day and 16 hours still available and that there should be 48 hours allocated for animations.<br/>
<br/>
I have little doubt that his settings are set to High and he is using Final Quality Renderworks. He had not set the server to be Sydney. I have spoken to him about this and he is resubmitting with less onerous settings. However I report this as the animation stopped even though it said there was a day to go. Is the processing clever enough to know it can not be computed in the time frame thus it quits the job or is this some sort of error as he contacted us about it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this is enough information for you? His serial is:<br/>

We have a company that suspects their files got corrupted because of the setup and disc space issues on their server. They sent us some of the files to try and recover as much information as possible but file sizes changed and they are nowt less than 5mb when they were at least 20 to 30 mb big before the corruption. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Is it possible to recover anything from these files at all?

- Choose &quot;Yes&quot; in the dialog that appears<br/>
- Now zoom/pan on the sheet<br/>

Note that now one of the viewports will appear empty. If you select that viewport and, for example, move it to the front of the stacking order, it&#39;ll then become visible but another one of the viewports will become empty.<br/>

When I try this on Windows 10, four Viewports become empty instead of just the one on Mac.<br/>

Note that a highlighting box shows on the Screen pane in a random location. This will remain even if you exit the symbol. The only way I could find to get rid of it was to close and reopen the file.<br/>

There&#39;ve been other cases of this that were fixed in past versions (VB-164379 for example).<br/>

                Format Text Dialog should apply vertical align before applying line spacing change

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is a minor text layout workflow/usability issue. It is not new.<br/>
<br/>
One important way our text object Vertical Alignment setting is applied involves changing of line spacing. If vertical alignment is top, and you change line spacing from single to double, the text object will grow downward. If vertical alignment is center, it will grow equal amounts upward and downward. If vertical alignment is bottom, it will grow upward.<br/>
<br/>
When using the OIP or Text menus to change these things, behavior is predictable because you only change one setting at a time.<br/>
<br/>
However when you use the format text dialog, you can change both vertical alignment and line spacing in a single operation through the dialog. In this case, the dialog should first apply the vertical alignment, then adjust the line spacing; it does the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
*To reproduce:*<br/>
 # Create a multi-line text object with single spacing and vertical align set to Top<br/>
 # With this object selected, open the Format Text dialog<br/>
 # Change vertical alignment to Bottom and line spacing to Double<br/>
<br/>
{*}EXPECTED{*}: the text object will resize its top edge higher to accommodate the double-spaced text, leaving its bottom edge unchanged<br/>
<br/>
{*}ACTUAL{*}: the text object resizes by lowering its bottom edge, as if it was still top-aligned; it now shows it has vertical alignment Bottom but it did not use this setting when resizing for the new spacing.

Note that now the default background is bright pink.<br/>

If I try this in VW 2022 before the Home Screen was added, the default background was solid white.<br/>

This might be related to the bug reported in VB-190088, which also involved a pink fill showing in the background.<br/>

This only affects Mac. The same thing happens going back to SP0.

Does anyone know the problem that the SWAP file is not deleted because you update references? So, during the saving process of file “A”, someone opens file “B” where the file “A” is referenced and during the opening process of file “B” the references are automatically updated. There is no error message when saving file “A” but the SWAP file remains on the server (with a different file size). When file “B” has finished opening and file “A” is saved again, the SWAP file disappears.<br/>
It looks like the update reference process blocks the saving workflow. Isn&#39;t updating references not only a read-only operation?<br/>
<br/>

Background render: Dashed Hidden Line<br/>
- The Slab is fully represented, but the Line is not Dashed.

When we switch to 2D view, we can see that the object on the left has Cut Plane Elevation of 1000 and if we switch the Cut Plane Elevation to 1193 or higher, it will display an opening in the middle, but if 1192 or less with will be displayed closed. Please take a look at this. Thank you.

Like its shown in the video, the objects in the drawing are duplicated (and the file size doubles as expected), afterwards the Purge Tool is used to delete duplicates and the file size goes back to its original size, but the duplicates remain in the drawing. After saving the file, the double size is again back.<br/>

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Create a new sheet layer Viewport that displays the DLVPs<br/>
- In the viewport&#39;s Class Properties dialog, enable the &quot;Use embedded design layer viewport settings for: Class overrides&quot; option<br/>
<br/>
Note that the embedded DLVPs all show the original texture, ignoring the class overrides. This happens with Shaded and RW modes.<br/>

The same thing happened in past versions.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open the Organization dialog and go to the Stories tab<br/>
- Edit Story-1<br/>
<br/>
Note that the browser lists &quot;Top of Slab&quot; above &quot;Finish Floor&quot;, and &quot;Ledge&quot; above &quot;Bottom of Slab&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
- Now edit the &quot;Top of Slab&quot; or &quot;Ledge&quot; levels and make a change (enable the &quot;Use Elevation Benchmark&quot; or &quot;Create Layer&quot; options)<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the dialog changes the listed order of the Story Levels, and the Story Level that was just edited moves downward in the list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding that this can make things pretty tricky when you&#39;re editing multiple levels and the order is constantly changing.<br/>
<br/>
This only seems to happen with Story Levels that share the same elevation, when the dialog list is sorted by Elev Offset (which it is by default).

                DOM: Permission Issues Site Protection Installer Monterey 12.6
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Hello<br/>
I have some issues installing the Site Protection server on my Computer after a Customer have the same issues. We both try to install on an intel mac with Monterey 12.6. We tried different installers by the customer he get an error -148. I think The Installer exptected a System Folder, that do not exist or a permission issue on a Folder so that the installer could not save a license File. On my Computer I got ActivationMessage11 with the International Site Protection Installer. With the German Installer I got the “Aktivierung fehlgeschlagen, da der Ordner mit den Aktivierungsdaten nicht existiert” <br/>
in english: “Activation failed, because the Folder with the Activation Data is missing”. This is an english Version on a French System.<br/>
Serial GHXENZ-0Z33BL-ECY2Z1-2DD61B<br/>
Activation: AC6-T5Q3GF-EN-2DD61B<br/>
<br/>
I think it is not a license Issue. Also the same issue with other Activation Keys from other Versions. It seems to be an issue on Monterey or a permission issue/ issue with existing files from older installations.<br/>
<br/>
After I manually created the Folder &quot;Reprice&quot; which was not existing. Unter MacHD/Library/Application Support, the Installer was able to go forward. I think the installer do not have enough permission to create a Folder in this directory on Monterey. Some users already have this folder so they have no issues. <br/>
<br/>
Every issues with site-protection results in customer, that are not able starting Vectorworks so I desided to rate as &quot;critical&quot; because on two monterey &quot;site protection servers&quot; I tested installation it failed at the same place<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Please watch attached movie. There is a significant delay when the stairs are duplicated. But quite a lot of the delay does not happen within the stair&#39;s regeneration code as you would expect but in CStairPane::TransferValue (which is derived from IProviderShapePane and called by Vectorworks).<br/>
The stairs need to update certain widgets in the OIP by adding up all these values from all other selected stairs. So in TransferValue, a loop is called that traverses all selected stairs in the drawing. THe problem seems to be that TransferValue seems to be called for each of the newly created stairs thus causing each of them to traverse the entire drawing. SO the time for this is O(n*n) (n being the number of &quot;new&quot; stairs). This is causing the enormous delay. I think Vectorworks should do something to avoid this delay as there is actually only 1 OIP. Maybe TransferValue should only be called once after all stairs are duplicated and reset or there should be some way to inform IProviderShapePane::TransferValue that VW is in &quot;Duplicate along array mode&quot;.

<br/>
To reproduce, in each version, enter the viewport&#39;s Section In-Place edit mode.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the ruler bars show in 2021 but not in 2022 (or in 2023).<br/>
<br/>
This also happens in Elevation In-Place edit mode for non-section Viewports.<br/>
<br/>
When on a design layer the ruler bars do show in Front views, so it seems like they should also show here.<br/>
<br/>
Ruler bars were removed in some areas as part of the 2022 Screen Plane Deprecation task (T02121), so I&#39;m guessing this is related to that.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The attached video demonstrates this bug, which I think is a result of a mistaken logic in the color picker for detecting a change to a multi-color text selection.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a text object with three words, in default black color<br/>
 # Change two of the words to distinct colors<br/>
 # Select the text object; note that black pen color is active in the Attributes panel<br/>
 # Click the pen color and select black as the color, attempting to change all text back to black<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: there is a way to coerce all text back to black<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: no change is applied because the color picker doesn&#39;t think you&#39;ve changed anything, even though there are non-black text runs selected<br/>
<br/>
ALSO: if instead of selecting the text object, you enter edit mode and select all of the text, the same issue occurs<br/>
<br/>
BUT: you *can* change the color of all text in both scenarios _as long as you choose a color that is not currently displayed as the attributes pen color_. That is, the logic of whether you can make a change is not based on the colors of the text you have selected, it is based on whether or not you would change the active pen color shown in the Attributes panel (which does not show &#39;indeterminate&#39; color for multi-color selection, as it probably should).<br/>
<br/>
Found in the latest mainline build (2024) but went back and verified it&#39;s there in VW 2021.

                Mac - Vectorworks fails to paste styled text from PDF even though same text from RTF works
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      This is a bug in the text clipboard-paste handling in Vectorworks on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce this issue:<br/>
 # Launch Vectorworks, create a new document<br/>
 # Open the *VectorScriptGuide.pdf* file in the Preview application<br/>
 # On page 6, select multi-line styled text beginning with *An Example Script* and including some of the procedure source code below that and copy it to the clipboard via Edit-&gt;Copy<br/>
 # In Vectorworks, create a new text object and paste into it, _OR_ with the selection tool active and nothing selected, choose Edit-&gt;Paste<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: in both cases, we end up with a text object that has multi-line styled text with the heading bold, the paragraph text in a serif font, and the procedure source text in a monospace font.<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the text style is not preserved in the Vectorworks test object; the title, paragraph text, and source code text are all just in the currently set default font.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE that if you go to the TextEdit application and paste in the text copied in the PDF file, it will paste in correctly styled. If you then select it again in TextEdit and paste it into Vectorworks (using either approach), Vectorworks behaves as expected (applying text styles).<br/>
<br/>
The data which the Preview application copies to the clipboard does include styled public.rtf data, so Vectorworks is simply not handling it properly.

                Resource Usability: no feedback that you can&#39;t apply an image as a material
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      In the resource manager when you are searching for an resource it is easy to mistake an image resource for a texture resource. Although it is possible to filter correctly, the lack of feedback when you try to apply an image as a texture is still confusing and could be improved.<br/>
<br/>
The feedback is inconsistent because, if you try to apply a material texture to a 2D object, you get a warning beep and the attempt does nothing. Applying an image to a 3D extrude does nothing to it, so it should also provide at least a warning beep, better yet an explanatory dialog.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce a problem scenario:<br/>
 # In an untitled Vectorworks document switch to a 3D iso view and shaded rendering mode.<br/>
 # Create an extrude and leave it selected.<br/>
 # In the resource manager, leave All Resources as the filter type and in the search field type &quot;Wood Decking Barn&quot; and press enter<br/>
 # Notice that there are several resources which appear which look very similar<br/>
 # Right Click on &quot;Wood Decking Barn Wood IF&quot; and click Apply<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: since this is an image resource that will not apply to our 3D object, a warning should be issued - at least a beep, better yet an explanatory message<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the texture will be downloaded (if needed) and imported to the current document, but there is no change to the selected extrude and no beep<br/>
<br/>
Note that if at step 5 you instead right click on &quot;Wood Decking Bar Wood &lt;Surface Hatch&gt;&quot;, the procedure will result in the texture applied to the object, which is probably what the user would be after in these steps. (If you have selected a 2D shape instead of an extrude, applying the image works properly creating a fill for the 2D shape.)

We have a Windows user who has uploaded his font &#39;Metropolis&#39; to the VCS. He can see it there in the list on his machine and in the folder. He has checked that his mapping in the VCS app + Vectorworks are not mapping Metropolis.<br/>
<br/>
Yet each time he publishes using the cloud it gets mapped to Ariel.<br/>

I have installed them on my Mac and it all works as expected. I am reporting this as a bug because I can&#39;t get any further on this issue. Screenshots and fonts enclosed. He&#39;s on 2022 SP4 ( SP5 not released yet in Australia).<br/>

Open test file<br/>
<br/>
Update the viewport<br/>
<br/>
This is where I noticed the crash.<br/>
<br/>
I had the Kitchen Counter file open first and was able to update the viewport there without any issues. I got the crash when I opened the &quot;Lounge&quot; file and updated the viewport there. This could be a fluke but thought it is worth logging as a bug. <br/>

                T02274 - Site Modifiers are Selectable in Plan View When Invisible
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Movie and test file are attached. The file contains a Planar Pad modifier with default settings.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Make the Site-DTM-Modifier class invisible<br/>
-Draw a marquee around the modifier<br/>
<br/>
Note that it can&#39;t be selected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now enable the &quot;Show Surface in 3D&quot; option for the modifier<br/>
-Again try to select it with a marquee<br/>
<br/>
Note that now it can be selected even though it&#39;s invisible.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like this is happening because the surface component of the modifier isn&#39;t assigned to the Site-DTM-Modifier class, so it&#39;s technically staying visible/selectable even though it has no plan graphics to show. This leaves an odd situation where you can select things that you can&#39;t see.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally the surface&#39;s visibility would also be tied to the Site-DTM-Modifier class. Since the modifier surfaces aren&#39;t intended to be viewed alongside the Site Model, they&#39;ll need to be hidden most of the time and that would be an easy way to do it.

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Try to select the Pad<br/>
<br/>
Note that it works fine at this point.<br/>
<br/>
-Now select the Texture Bed and enable the &quot;Show Surface in 3D&quot; option<br/>
<br/>
Note that now the Pad can&#39;t be click-selected, even if X-Ray Fills is used. <br/>
<br/>
Since the surface of the modifier only shows in 3D it doesn&#39;t seem like it should be occluding things in Top/Plan.

<br/>
Open the document<br/>
Try snapping to any of the geometry in the viewport.<br/>
-&gt; You will notice that you can snap to objects near the outside edges but not the inner part.<br/>
Enter the crop.<br/>
Delete the crop and exit back to the sheet layer.<br/>
Now, you should be able to snap to the expected points. <br/>

<br/>
After Zoom, time taken for the objects to be sharp displayed:<br/>
<br/>
- With 26.0.5(622768): 6 seconds<br/>
- With 27.0.4b(645900) and Accelerate Graphics active: 57 seconds<br/>
<br/>
- With 27.0.4b(645900) and Navigation Graphics not active, Vectorworks at first freezes right after I scroll the mouse wheel to zoom out, shown in the video at around 3:05 until around 3:58, thats 53 seconds of freeze! Afterwards it loads partially the pdf. It will need a full minute more to load the rest of the PDF. Thats about 2 minutes on total to load a sharp image of a PDF Import with Accelerate Graphics off.<br/>
<br/>
This means even if a Customer has Accelerate Graphics ON, it will take almost a full minute for the PDF to be sharp displayed everytime its zoomed in or out.<br/>
<br/>
I am marking this as Regression, because of the huge difference of time between 26.0.5 and 27.0.4 and also as QRT because the time needed to sharp the pdf is really bad for the Customer.

To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
- Open the test file and zoom<br/>
- Now create a new blank file<br/>
- Close the blank file<br/>
<br/>
Note that it takes about 40+ seconds for the file to close and the focus to return to the first file.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead of closing the second file, you manually switch back the first one, the delay is only about 20-25 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened in previous versions.<br/>

This test file originated with the VB-153415 report which also involved performance issues, so it&#39;s possible the two are related.

When we rotate the drawing in 3D view, we can see the content inside of the Viewports also rotating. Is this behavior expected and correct?<br/>

  a message dialog that online help is not available and you have<br/>
  the option to use one locally.<br/>
-Now if I access the color selector through the Organization dialog by editing<br/>
 a class or design layer fill/Pen. Now if you click on the help (question mark icon).<br/>
 notice no message dialog about local help doesn&#39;t appear. Sometimes new windows Os <br/>

                SBE: Vectorscript Parser can&#39;t handle files containing BOM (Byte order mark)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      About 7 years after the unicodization of Vectorworks, Vectorscript parser reports a syntax error if a Vectorscript file contains a byte order mark (BOM). This is very annoying. In Unicode times, it often happens - after editing a VS file or by some weird behavior of Perforce - that a Vectorscript dialog suddenly gets a BOM and after that the dialog can&#39;t be executed any more because Vectorscript reports a syntax error in the first line.<br/>
<br/>
As BOM is an official part of text file format in Unicode times, the Vectorscript parser should handle this also.<br/>
<br/>
Problem exists on Mac and Windows.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce, just add a BOM to an arbitrary VS dialog script (most text editors support this) and try opening the dialog in Vectorworks.<br/>

                Windows Character Map paste overrides active text style and color

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      I&#39;m not sure if this is a bug or a feature request, but given that Character Map is a source of special characters (not really a source of styled text content), I think if possible we should let the active Vectorworks text style prevail and only paste in the (unformatted) text. I&#39;m not sure if the Windows clipboard API makes it possible to disambiguate this.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # With nothing selected, open Format Text dialog and set font to Arial, size 20 pt, style Bold<br/>
 # Also use Attributes panel to change pen color to blue<br/>
 # Create a text object and type some text and verify it&#39;s 20 pt blue Arial in bold<br/>
 # Without changing anything create another (empty) text object<br/>
 # Open the Character Map program and Selector or double-click a number of characters so they appear in &quot;Characters to copy:&quot;, and click copy<br/>
 # Paste into your new text object<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the characters are pasted in using the style set for the text object, much as if they had been typed<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the characters are pasted in using a default size, style, and color (Cambria 15.2 pt plain, black pen color)<br/>
<br/>
Note that MS word gives the option to paste with or without formatting, so that&#39;s how this could be a feature request, to have additional format-aware paste options.<br/>
<br/>
Also note that if you first paste into notepad.exe, then copy from there, the behavior is as expected - we get the extended characters in 20 pt blue bold Arial.<br/>
<br/>
Even with general default support for pasting styled text from other applications, I wonder if it&#39;s possible to detect that the pasted text is coming from Character Map and in that case treat it as unstyled.<br/>

<br/>
We have a user calling about frequent crashes in Vectorworks 2022 but we can&#39;t see what could be causing the troubles. He doesn&#39;t seem to have any specific action or command that causes the crashing for him as well.<br/>
<br/>
The user in question is Andrew McIntyre (andrewtmcintyre@gmail.com) and their Serial Number is EHXUSZ-1ZYKMZ-ZRZDZC-G0AGNV. We haven&#39;t seen any crash reports on the Analytic Site.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached some of the more recent .DMP files from their Vectorworks User Folder as well as the information we have from the Windows Reliability Monitor. I&#39;m sorry if this isn&#39;t much to go off of, but any advice or knowledge is appreciated. Thanks for your time and have a great day! :)

                End key moves cursor without clearing selection, results in weird behavior
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The text edit behavior in a text object can get into a state where it shows both a blinking cursor and (at a different location) a selection, which makes it indeterminate what will happen when the user carries out an action, such as typing or pasting.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a text object and type &quot;hello bug&quot;<br/>
 # In edit mode, select the word &quot;hello&quot;<br/>
 # Use Ctrl-C/Cmd-C or the edit menu to copy the word; hello should still be selected<br/>
 # Use the End key to move the blinking cursor to the right of the word &#39;bug&#39;<br/>
 # Either type some text, or use Ctrl-V/Cmd-V or Edit-&gt;Paste<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: because there&#39;s a blinking cursor after &quot;bug&quot;, the text typed or pasted will be inserted after &quot;bug&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the text typed or inserted replaces the selection on the word &quot;hello&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Note that if you use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the end of the string, the selection on &quot;hello&quot; is cleared so the bug does not occur; paste or typing happens at the end as expected.<br/>
<br/>
I think the fix is to make use of the Home/End keys clear a text selection esp. when they move the cursor outside of the current selection.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably a pre-existing bug.<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: this occurs on Mac as well as Windows, if the Mac keyboard has home/end keys (e.g. Apple Magic Keyboard)

                Multiple text object style changes behave inconsistently in OIP, Format Text Dialog, Text Menu
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      These issues were found while trying to implement the text style button behaviors for the new View Bar (task T02250, ticket PLAT-247). This is a counterpart to VB-184926 - that bug talked about the visible UI controls, this bug is about the applied functionality.<br/>
<br/>
When applying a style like italic or bold, the code paths are very different from different UI components (OIP vs. Text menu vs. Format Text dialog), and the actual behaviors are also different from the user&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To reproduce the issues:<br/>
 # Create a new Vectorworks document with three simple text objects<br/>
 # Using the OIP while selecting each object separately, make one object bold, one object italic, one object plain text.<br/>
 # Select all three objects.<br/>
 # With all objects selected, toggle bold on*<br/>
<br/>
*do this three different ways: 1) using the Text-&gt;Style-&gt;Bold menu item, 2) using the Text-&gt;Format Text dialog clicking the Bold checkbox and hitting OK, 3) clicking the Bold checkbox in the OIP<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: all three approaches to applying bold (step 4) result in the same outcome<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: if the Text-&gt;Bold-&gt;Style menu item is chosen, bold is toggled in each selected text object, so you end up with a bold-italic object, a bold object that was formerly plain, and a plain object that was formerly bold. If the Format Text dialog is used, all objects become simply bold; note that the italic object loses its italic. If you use the OIP bold checkbox, the bold style is added to all objects; plain object become bold, bold object stays bold, and italic object becomes bold-italic.<br/>
<br/>
This has been an issue for some time, reproduced in VW 2021 and 2022, on both Mac and Windows. The code that implements each of these control paths is quite complicated, with proxy-UI code for menu dispatching in the first case, code specific to the font dialog in the second case, and very entangled OIP proxy-UI/widget code in the third case.<br/>

In the attached file we have a Group inside of a Group, which has complex objects that seem to be a Mesh. Not possible to be certain, because after trying to enter the second group layer to Edit, Vectorworks and actually the full Computer has frozen.<br/>
<br/>
It was using around 13GB RAM by when it was frozen.<br/>
<br/>
Before trying to enter the Group to see the objects inside, while simply panning and rotating, Vectorworks stutters a lot and freezes here and there momentarily.<br/>

-Click on the update button in the object info palette.<br/>
-Notice when it finishes rendering, it still in wireframe, but<br/>
  if you change the zoom value slightly it will update to Shaded.<br/>
-If you do the same exact steps in Windows 11, it will update with no<br/>

<br/>
I desperately need help with an important German customer; one of our biggest customer with over 400 licenses.<br/>
Unfortunately this customer is working with Vectorworks 2019 on one project.<br/>
See attached files and video.<br/>
Customer want to copy a group from file Bag sorters 20211123.vwx to file CopySymbolsProblem.vwx.<br/>
The group is on layer C100-006608-WALMART_GEN-2.0_US Bag sorter SMF_ILOX Edits_R1LR.<br/>
Copying it to file CopySymbolsProblem.vwx does not work correct. It results in a very big group container containing 140 objects, but you don&#39;t see the objects.<br/>
Copying it to a new empty file is working well.<br/>
Could you please help?<br/>
By the way, it does work in Vectorworks 2022 without any problems, but the customer needs it to works in Vectorworks 2019.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and regards, Klaus Lüttich<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we already had problems with this project in Vectorworks 2019 before, see VB-185526. Now it is a new problem.

<br/>
Some objects from a Viewport (eg. walls) are not exported to PDF. For further details watch the videos and read the steps described below.<br/>
<br/>
1. Open the attached Schnitt_Support_v2022.vwx file.<br/>
<br/>
2. Update the Referenced file that is also attached a &quot;broken references to other files&quot; warning will pop-up. Screenshot attached.<br/>
<br/>
3. Update all Viewports.<br/>
<br/>
4. Export to PDF like its shown in the attached Video.mov file.<br/>
<br/>
Result: Objects from the Section Viewport that are in the Viewport 120/1, eg. Walls, will not be displayed in the PDF.<br/>
<br/>
In the Video 2.mov we can see that when changing the Background Render of the Viewport 120/1 to a different render like for example Hidden Line, some objects will not be displayed anymore. Eg. the same walls that are not exported to PDF.<br/>
<br/>
When we switch the background render back to Wireframe, the display is not the same as originally was.<br/>
<br/>
Due to all of this, this render and export functions are obsolete for the Customer, hence we do request someone to take a look at this asap.

<br/>
Can certain resources be changed in such a way that it takes up less space? Sure, but this is not the question I&#39;m posing here.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:<br/>
Where is the difference?<br/>
<br/>
Deleting a certain symbol definition from an 800MB vwx document (with VGM cache) reduces its file size to 527MB, but importing this same symbol into an empty file and orbit the view to get the VGM cache and then saving that file, results in only 82MB, NOT 273MB.<br/>
<br/>
[Here|https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-184863?focusedCommentId=828810&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-828810] [~rberge] says, that this symbol takes up 223MB.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching four documents and a video explaining these documents and their differences.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore:<br/>
Disabling VGM cache for HK-078x100.vwx reduces its size from 82 to 9.1MB, while disabling VGM cache for HK-078x100-support-mesh.vwx does not reduce its size of 9.3MB. Quite astounding, wouldn&#39;t you say?

<br/>
In the attached Vectorworks file we have a few rectangles that have Tiles as a Fill. This rectangles are touching each other and should be displayed as such, despite that we can clearly see gaps in between this rectangles and the same when we export to PDF.<br/>
<br/>
While panning the drawing (shown in the video after the pdf export), the gaps aren&#39;t being displayed... in fact while we hold the mouse middle button and pan the drawing, we can see how the drawing should be displayed, without gaps.<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at this and if you also know of a Workaround to present the Customer, we would be greatly appreciated. Its important for the Customer to have in the drawing represented an intact floor without any gaps at all, as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.

<br/>
However if there&#39;s no text object selected you can also make atomic changes to the default text style for new objects through the Text menu, for example changing the font, size, or typographic style. If such a change is made which differs from the mode bar&#39;s active text style, the latter should revert to &lt;Unstyled&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Specific reproduce instructions:<br/>
 # Create a new document and activate the Text tool<br/>
 # In the mode bar set the text style to Notes 10 pt<br/>
 # In the Text-&gt;Size menu change the size to 20 pt; note that this size will be used when you create a new text object<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: at step 3 since the size no longer matches &quot;Notes 10 pt&quot; that style should no longer be shown in the mode bar text style pull-down<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the mode bar text style pull-down continues to show &quot;Notes 10 pt&quot; even though the text tool is now configured to create text objects with 20 pt size<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested everywhere but I suspect this is a pre-existing issue on both Mac and Windows. Found in VW2023 but reproduced in VW2022 also.<br/>

<br/>
After opening the Purge Tool, which took a few minutes to load, we can see (screenshot attached) that there are 112352 Design Layers, although in the Navigation Palette we can only see 22 Design Layers. Why is this?<br/>
<br/>
When deleting this 112352 Design Layers, it also deletes needed Layers that we can see displayed in the Navigation Palette. I could do this only the first time. After trying to Purge this again (attempted two more times), Vectorworks freezes and after 30 minutes is still trying to execute the operation. The first time needed a few minutes, can&#39;t say exactly how many as I unfortunately didn&#39;t measured the time (one of the reasons I have tried to Purge a second and third time. other was to better test performance).<br/>
<br/>
After the first and only successful Purge, the file is visibly faster, but it deleted also many objects that are in the file and are needed for the Customer. This is not a viable solution for the problem. Nevertheless, I believe that first detecting what is causing the performance problem is a priority.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to see what is causing this file bad performance? Please take a look.

                Format Text dialog size field does not honor selected range of text

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      If you are editing a text object with a varied run of fonts, styles, etc. when you select a word or sequence of characters with uniform formatting, the OIP and Text menus will reflect that selection. For instance if just one word is bold and you select that word, you&#39;ll see bold checked in OIP and in Text-&gt;Font Style menu. The same is true for font, size, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The Format Text dialog works this way too, except for font size. For some reason it just picks one size used in the text object and displays that, even if you have text of a different size selected.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Create a text object with the text &quot;small medium large&quot;<br/>
 # Edit the text object and select each word in turn, using OIP (or sim.) to change &quot;small&quot; to 10 pt text, &quot;medium&quot; to 14 pt text, and &quot;large&quot; to 20 pt text.<br/>
 # Now while still editing, put the cursor in each word (or select each word) and note that OIP&#39;s size pulldown updates; sim. for Text-&gt;Size menu.<br/>
 # Now do the same, only open the Format Text dialog from the Text menu as you put the cursor in or select each word.<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the size field in the Format Text dialog reflects the active text size based on edit selection or insertion location in the multi-styled text.<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: the size field always displays the same size no matter what you select in this text object - for example it might always display 10 pt, even when you have the 20 pt word selected.<br/>
<br/>
This is not new - same behavior exists in VW 2021 and 2022, both Mac and Windows.

In the attached video, I have already launched Vectorworks, with Braceworks and ConnectCAD enabled on another computer.

<br/>
The assumption in the comment is not correct.<br/>
Mouse-entered and mouse-exited events are associated with the drawing view (fActiveView) that has just been entered or exited.<br/>
It can be different from the active one if there are two document windows open.<br/>
<br/>
This is a BUG-only assert but I think understand if something unexpected is going on here.

<br/>
This is from user Tom Klaber on the forum:<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks seems to be running slower and slower.  It will just stop and think about nothing for MINUTES.  A change in sheet layer will be met with 3 to 5 minutes sitting there.  No operation done - just a change in view.  The view is visible - but it will go into Not Responding for MINUTES.  What is going on??  What is it thinking about?? Its just a sheet with 2 elevations.  It is so frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even changing panels in the Navigation panel - not even switching layers - just switching between Sheet Layers and Design Layers in the Navigation pane - can seize VW up for minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What is going on??<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So - its definitely a memory issue.  I have isolated it to the fact that after I publish the set - the memory is shot - consumed to 96% and will not recover.  I have 32 GB - but I need to quit VW / restart the machine to get any useability back.  This is extra frustrating because if I need to make a small change to the export - I have to republish which will Cookie Monster my memory like a sheet of warm fresh baked Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. <br/>

I am not tech savvy enough to understand why this would be - but I have noticed that the more BIM hidden line renderings I have the worst it is. <br/>

Vectorworks gets stuck on Mac. Had to force quit. On Windows VW quits silently right after update command is run.

It took close to 4 minutes for the Sheet Layer to load and be workable, in the meantime the RAM has risen to 20,85 GB. This value will not go down afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
3. As example for the Viewports, Update the Viewport &quot;Ansichtsbereich-4&quot;. It will take about 1 minute to update and the RAM in use will increase one more GB, getting close to 22 GB. Curious is that after the update is done, the RAM will decrease to 18,66 GB, which is less than the initial value of 20,85 GB.

The Viewport, like shown in the video, has a few 2D/3D Symbols which the display is pixeled on the edges if JPEG is the Default Compression in use.<br/>

When switching to PNG, the display is then correct.

notice that the pan operation is undone, and it shouldn&#39;t be because I didn&#39;t click Edit-&gt;Undo.  Looks like changes around 592131 about deprecating screen plane might have introduced this.

This seems to only happen if the object is rotated.

About Problem<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
When running any Renderworks rendering with &quot;Crop perspective view&quot; enabled, 2D objects outside of the crop frame display.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;Turn off unified view&quot; in &quot;Legacy 2D&quot; tab on &quot;Document Preferences&quot; is turned on, 3D objects outside of the crop frame display as well.<br/>
<br/>
Steps:<br/>
1) Go to File &gt; Document Settings &gt; Document Preferences...<br/>
2) Check &quot;Enable legacy 2D feature&quot; in &quot;Legacy 2D&quot; tab and click OK.<br/>
Then go to &quot;Document Preference&quot; again.<br/>
3) Check &quot;Crop perspective view&quot; in &quot;Display&quot; tab and click OK.<br/>
4) Draw a 2D and a 3D object.<br/>
5) Set the current view to &quot;Right Isometric&quot;.<br/>
6) Set the projection to &quot;Normal Perspective&quot;.<br/>
7) Drag the frame corners to decrease the size of the window, to be the objects are on outside of the frame.<br/>
8) Run any Renderworks rendering. (Ex. Final Quality Rendering)<br/>
9) The 2D object that is on outside of the crop frame displays.<br/>
10) Go to &quot;Document Preference&quot; and check &quot;Turn off unified view&quot; in &quot;Legacy 2D&quot; tab.<br/>
11) The 3D object that is on outside of the crop frame displays as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Remarks<br/>
-If exporting as PDF, both 2D/3D objects that are on outside of the frame don&#39;t show.<br/>
-In case of runnning &quot;Shaded&quot; or &quot;Hidden Line&quot; Rendering, objects on outside of the frame don&#39;t show.<br/>
-With enabling &quot;Turn off unified view&quot;, 2D/3D objects that are on outside of the frame show when running Fast / Final Quality / Custom / Artistic Renderworks.<br/>
-With disabling &quot;Turn off unified view&quot;, 2D objects that are on outside of the frame show when running Fast / Final Quality / Custom Renderworks<br/>
-Only when running Artistic Renderworks, objects will show properly.<br/>
<br/>
Please refer to &quot;sample12819.vwx&quot;,&quot;movie12819.mov&quot;,&quot;Turn off unified view_ON.png&quot; and &quot;Turn off unified view_OFF.png&quot;.<br/>

The code should differentiate between viewports and parametrics and use TDLViewportHandler in the latter case.

In the file we have some referenced symbols that represent kitchen objects, which we can see that are double displayed in the Viewport, although when we open the Edit Viewport Dialog, the objects are not doubled.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot find the reason why this objects are being double displayed, please take a look at this.

<br/>
*Issue:* with different selection order different (and wrong) deterministic results will be accumulated.<br/>
 *Reason:* consequtive iterations of different object flags leads to consequtive two-by-two comparisons (saved and iterated value). The new (D)eterminted or (N)ot result overrides the old one.<br/>
 *E.g.:* (1-0-4) &amp; (0-2-4) = (N-N-D). Then (1-0-4) &amp; (1-0-0) = D-D-N. The last comparison overrides any previous results, instead of starting from determined and only changing to not-determined specific field values with each iteration.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
 * Reproduced in earlier release versions too.<br/>
 * Depending on the plugin implementation, there might be issues with two or three+ objects in multiple selection.

<br/>
When placing the next truss object, the entire truss highlights instead of just the single line indicating the direction of the truss.<br/>
<br/>
I found if right click on placed truss and select customize truss symbol data, then just clicking ok on the next two dialog boxes, it resets something and that symbol of truss starts to work as it should.  This needs to be done on every different type of truss though.<br/>

<br/>
In the file, depending on the plan rotation, not all 2D components are displayed in the section of the symbols. If the plan rotation is 0.00° , all 2D components are visible in the section. However, if the plan rotation is rotated to, for example, 90° , some objects from the symbol are missing in the section.<br/>
I think it would be easier if there was a threshold in the rotation of the setction-evelation line line for rendering the 2D component view as described in this report. https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-163622<br/>

A Best Performance problem with tile in walls. They won&#39;t be visible on a sheet layer, if you deactivate the accelerate graphics. Also they include in a pdf export. Here I think that the pdf export does not use the Best Performance rendering.<br/>

I tested that with 2020 (I have no 2018 accessible right now) and found a Speed regression from about 500% in 2022 compared to 2020. It would be nice if you could take a look at that. Thank you very much.

                Windows: Significant delay on creation of new text object in new document

<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
 # Launch Vectorworks, wait for new untitled document to load<br/>
 # Select the Text tool<br/>
 # Click on the draw area to create a text object<br/>
<br/>
EXPECTED: the new text object is immediately created and a cursor becomes active allowing you to type text content into it<br/>
<br/>
ACTUAL: there is a delay of several seconds, with a spinning delay cursor, before the text object actually appears<br/>
<br/>
This only happens initially - after that text objects are created on first click.<br/>
<br/>
This does not happen on Mac.

I think that the problem is not in the Landscape project because I found that in the function _void CheckForClassObjectWithoutByClass(BlankHandle u, void* env)_ ( SRefListMgr.cpp ) it is checked whether the parent of current object is a _kParametricNode_ and if it is not only then _env.found / foundText_ will change to true which will lead to calling the function _gSDK-&gt;SetTextStyleByClass_ and the subsequent recalculation of the text object.
