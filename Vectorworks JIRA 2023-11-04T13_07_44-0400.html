We&#39;d like an additional setting under 3D Vectorworks Preferences, to control the default projection of plan and elevation views separately from the &#39;isometric&#39; views.<br/>
<br/>
We have had the ability for some time now to control the default 3D View Projection, between Orthographic and Perspective, which is great.  However, as mentioned by Andy in [this thread|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/101471-change-default-projection-to-perspective-when-orbiting-from-topplan/#comment-444368], if we set this to Perspective then this setting not only applies to &#39;isometric&#39; views but also to the plan and elevation views, which is not desirable. Instead we&#39;d like to be able to set the isometric views to perspective while setting the plan and elevation views to orthographic.<br/>
<br/>
*2. Provide option to have these settings apply regardless of which projection the user is switching from*<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we&#39;d like an option to have the above settings apply regardless of which projection the user is switching from, instead of only applying when switching from Top/Plan view, as they do now.<br/>

<br/>
This comes from the following issue with the information copied from the original bug VB-189062:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you open the &quot;Blank (Imperial).sta&quot; file and look at the Colors in Active Document, you&#39;ll see that these three swatches exist by default:<br/>
<br/>
• CMYK: (0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000)<br/>
<br/>
• CMYK: (0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000)<br/>
<br/>
• CMYK: (0.000, 0.000, 0.000, 0.467) [side note - why is this not 50% gray?]<br/>
<br/>
It would be better if these default swatches matched the nomenclature in the Standard Vectorworks Colors palette:<br/>
<br/>
• White<br/>
<br/>
• Black<br/>
<br/>
• Gray 50%<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise when you choose black or white from Standard Vectorworks Colors, these are brought in to the file as new swatches, so now you have two blacks and two whites, etc. This is messy and annoying.<br/>
<br/>
The blank template should be updated to be consistent with the standard color palette.<br/>
<br/>
(This wish is magnified by the fact that we can&#39;t currently delete and replace swatches in a file, which is a necessary future improvement.)&quot;<br/>

<br/>
In the object styles settings of the structure elements, the &quot;choose profile&quot; option is not locked. As a result, the structure element adapts to the dimensions of the object style, but not to its shape.<br/>
<br/>
See video<br/>
<br/>
Video is made in the Dutch Vectorworks but we are using the same structure element objecstyle. We just translated the symbol names. So the same bug appears in the English version.

<br/>
Non-Rigging objects do not move at all inside Hanging Positions when the command buttton is activated and neither does the Hanging Position height either.<br/>

This means that any custom-made rigging objects will not work with this command at all.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps there&#39;s a built in technical limitation causing this, but it would be great if this window appeared more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering - does Vectorworks have to load everything for all 10 categories / panes before the window appears? Could it just load the Sheet Data pane, then load the rest in the background after the window appears? (Not sure how this works, I&#39;m just hypothesizing)<br/>
<br/>
Also, (perhaps this should be a separate VE) it would be nice if Sheet Data fields existed directly in the OIP as well so we could just enter and edit data on the fly more responsively.

<br/>
However, if you change the name of the catalog, it&#39;s impossible to launch the two commands &quot; &quot; Update plant data&quot; or &quot;Update Vectorworks Plantes style&quot;, the message indicates that &quot;*_there were 0 updated in the Vectorworks Plant Database and (..) were not found by searching their Latin names_*&quot;. But if you edit the plant style in the preferences, and choose the catalog, the plant automatically recognizes the latin name.<br/>
<br/>
Many of our customers have a huge library of plant styles, and unfortunately they have this problem of the catalog name being changed and not remembering the old name (or just  they have created a catalog based on a filemaker file). They can&#39;t link the plant styles one by one, because it would be a lot of work. The question is :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;_Is it possible to force a plant style to recognize the new catalog, in order to update the plant styles automatically_ by latin name ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I tried to use the  data manager &quot;Sourceplantlist&quot; to get the link, or with ODBC, but it doesn&#39;t work, ans it&#39;s very limiting for the customers. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here are the files I got from a customer <br/>
- His filemaker file (.usr)<br/>
-His Vectorworks file with plant styles ( _Plantes_listes champs (Design express).vwx)_<br/>
-His catalog (.txt) (EDJ 2022)<br/>
- A video explaining the description of the ticket

<br/>
The textures I&#39;m currently looking at are roof textures with &quot;vertical&quot; elements (repeating in the horizontal direction) like Standing Seam, Clay Tile roofs, etc.  While other textures should also be looked at, the Roof ones are the most critical due to how they&#39;re mapped to Roof and Roof Faces.<br/>

See that attached VWX file to see the issues with one of the standing seam roof textures.  Other texture need to be evaluated.

This make it incredibly slow to up date label positions if you are working with more than a single hoist, as each label has to be moved separately. <br/>
With the old hoist object the hoist had a set of label coordinates that defined its offset from the hoist. This enabled users to both preset the label offset before insertion of a hoist and to easily update the label offset of existing hoists by either group selecting and entering the offset into the properties or using Spotlight numbering.<br/>
The measurement label does have X Y offset fields.<br/>
<br/>
The old hoist object had label offset controls<br/>
<br/>
The offset value is fairly important for documentation as although you can in theory use a data tag for the label the tag will not be colorized as a result of a Braceworks calculation when displaying the calculation results.<br/>

This is not what you put into these fields. You put in insertion size (i.e. the size of the plant at planting _or_ the size used in the design (which is not the same as mature). <br/>

Mature size is only extra information about the plant, found under the &#39;More data&#39; tab, and has nothing to do with the size you set up your plant style as.<br/>
<br/>
This is most obvious when looking at trees - an oak could have a mature spread of 40m+, but you&#39;d never place the tree at that size in a scheme (it takes hundreds of years for it to grow to that size).<br/>

Can we change this to &#39;spread/height at design/insertion&#39; or similar?<br/>

Open a new blank Vectorworks file.<br/>
With the resource browser pointed to HS Library.vwx Place three hardscape objects in the new blank file by dragging the hardscape style objects from the HS Library (in the resource browser) into the drawing window of the new blank file.<br/>
<br/>
Note that each of the hardscapes placed in the new file have different names.  These are the names of the hardscape when the style was created.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that each of the hardscape styles are found in a folder of the same name as in the library file.<br/>
 <br/>
Duplicate the third placed hardscape.<br/>
<br/>
From the resource browser Drag one of the Hardscape styles over one of the placed hardscapes in the new file (with a different style) to change the style of the placed hardscape.  Note that the name changes to match that from the style and the hardscape appearance matches the new style.  This is the expected behaviour.  Note also that the hardscape styles remain in the same folder.<br/>
<br/>
Select the third hardscape and using the object info pallet style pull down replace the style with the style with the first object shown in the resulting dialog. Do not attempt to select a different different style.  Note that the resultant hardscape name does not change to match the style.  This is the bug and it is concerning as it might result in a number of placed hardscape objects that have names that do not match there appearance leading to quantity take off errors.<br/>
<br/>
There appears to be a second bug if you select a style other than the first one offered and this will be reported separately.

In the rescue manager isn&#39;t the dialog for the object style options present. So you can&#39;t edit the primary class of the plant. It would be nice, when you can definet beforehand the object class and also the other insert options. Currently the plant tool uses by the insert the active class.<br/>

If you reshape one of the Pads slightly so that the edges _don&#39;t_ coincide the problem goes away, so it doesn&#39;t seem like this elevation error should be happening.

If you have a Site Model and place the 2D Contour Labels into their own class via the Settings&gt;Graphics, users are able to make them visible or invisible.<br/>
<br/>
If they are made invisible then the contours have unsightly gaps where the labels once were. This is a cosmetic bug. Surely the labels once made invisible should not make the contours discontinuous? <br/>
<br/>
As the labels are placed by the program the gaps can be cosmetically very unappealing.<br/>

Please see the enclosed screenshots.<br/>

By default, newly created classes in a document are set to be &#39;Invisible&#39; for existing Saved Views and existing Viewports. This can be changed if you create a new class and change the pull down to &#39;Visible&#39;. The Help at the bottom states:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Select a visibility to be assigned, for the new classes, in all existing saved views/viewports. This does not apply to classes that are already in the document&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Logic assumes that from now on any new classes are preset to be visible and they are. Logic also assumes that this setting applies to all new classes introduced into the document. <br/>
<br/>
The bug is that this is not true. If any new classes are introduced into the drawing by bringing in a symbol or an object or a PIO that has new classes attached, then these classes are invisible in existing Saved Views and existing Viewports! There is no way to change this behaviour although users think that having set it up before in the New Class dialogue they should be visible. This defies logic. <br/>
<br/>
The only solution is to tediously change the visibilities of existing Saved Views and existing Viewports in a drawing. Few users know that in the Organisation dialogue the Visibilities button top right allows them to do this editing quickly. Mostly they do it on individual viewports and Saved Views and this can happen many times in a design as new things are introduced. This is a regular complaint about the program being complicated and in this case illogical. Movie enclosed.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Being able to sort cells is great in the Cell Visibility and Sorting dialogue. However as the naming (or &quot;Summary Value&quot;) is an incomprehensible list of letters and numbers it is impossible to know what cell is what.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that this Summary Value could relate to something for users, and also that there was a preview button. This preview button would be like the one available in viewports for class and layer visibilities. <br/>
<br/>
At least then users can have an idea about what is what but in the Cell Visibility and Sorting dialogue they are blind. A preview button would be an immense help as one has to go back and forth and it is very tedious.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Previously, you could select a space object and using the double-click option to directly reshape the boundary line. In VW23, data tag will instead be selected if the 2d boundary is off. If you only have a simple square room, you can find the boundary line in the upper right corner even when the 2D boundary is off, but if there are walls all around, this will not work. As the wall for example will be selected instead. The only way to edit the boundary line seems to be if the space object has the 2D boundary line active and even esier if it´s also filled. Compared to how it worked before, when you could quickly double click on a space object and get to the reshape mode of the a boundary line, I find it much harder to reshape the space object quickly now. I would like to see an easy way to flip between the space object/boundary and the data tags for example by hitting tab when one of those obejects are selected.

    </p>
</td>

It&#39;s currently not possible to create Pathway-type modifiers using the &quot;Create objects from shapes&quot; command, though, which presents some limitations.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie and test file show an example of this. The file contains a few open Polygons.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Convert one of the polys to a Pathway-type Hardscape using the &quot;Create objects from shapes&quot; command.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this creates a pathway Hardscape as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now convert the other poly to a Path-type Site Modifier<br/>
<br/>
Note that it always uses a boundary-type configuration, with no way to treat the input poly as a longitudinal path line.<br/>
<br/>
This means the only way to create pathway-type Site Modifiers is by drawing with the Site Modifier tool itself. This can be difficult because you have to draw the line perfectly; if you make a mistake you&#39;ll either have to start over or manually reshape the path after it&#39;s created (it&#39;s very difficult to keep a consistent width at that point).<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, any closed poly would be treated as the outline for a Boundary-type modifier, and any open poly would be treated as the longitudinal path for a Pathway-type modifier.

The switch to a symbol-based tool, that can project onto any surface and considers the given data of both lenses and projectors, would meet the desires.<br/>

These composed nouns are very frequent in Dutch, and oblige translators to adjust translations for these nouns, which is not always a very elegant solution.<br/>

<br/>
I see this more as a bug than a VE. But, maybe I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands separators are not working on data tags or any other places, even if the option is configured on system preferences (Os). This is happening on Vectorworks 2022 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Versions before (I can&#39;t be precise on when it was gone), Os units had an impact on Vectorworks units display, especially on areas. Right now it only affects the decimal point. <br/>
<br/>
Now the user is having clarity loss for larger numbers (more than one thousand).<br/>
See the image attached.<br/>
<br/>
The fix can be:<br/>
<br/>
1. Use thousands separators option checked should work for area units and perimeter also. Only works for linear dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
2. Use the Os setting for the symbol used in the OS system preferences. <br/>
<br/>
This should work with area units, perimeters, and volumes, in every part of Vectorworks: <br/>
object info (displays) and reports (data tags, for example)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Effectively this means that there is no way to use a speaker or speaker array with the Electrical components.

<br/>
Open the attached document and notice that Symbols 1, 2 and 4 can be scaled asymmetrically, but Symbols 3 and 134 *can* *not*.<br/>
There&#39;s a screenshot of the produced error message - _&quot;Some of the objects in the symbol could not be scaled asymmetrically.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
Steps to reproduce:<br/>
1) Create an extrude out of a polygon, rectangle or any other shape.<br/>
2) Rotate the extrude 45 degrees.<br/>
3) Create a Symbol from that extrude.<br/>
4) Notice that when applying an asymmetric scaling on a single axis the extrude isn&#39;t scaled - an error message is shown.<br/>
<br/>
This might be WAD, as I have seen marked on some similar bugs. But scaling asymmetrically in the direction of the extrusion seems like it should work even on rotated extrudes. As this type of scaling will preserve the object type.

<br/>
New tool features:<br/>
<br/>
Allow closure of an open polyline with the Connect/Combine, Fillet or Chamfer command - in addition to checking the closed box in the OIP and getting an odd angle between open endpoints, allow a user to select either mode and settings to close using either tool.<br/>
<br/>
Allow a user to &quot;redo&quot; a Connection, Fillet or Chamfer<br/>
 Currently on a polyline, once a fillet is complete, there is no easy way to adjust the fillet - the two lines that were used to determine the fillet are still present, but I cannot use the fillet command to eliminate the current arc and redo the fillet easily. This seems basic? As long as the lines selected are co-planar eliminate whatever existed previously between them and join the lines at a point (connect/combine), or with a fillet or chamfer. For some reason the polyline is getting in the way of constructing the desired shape, I know this is possible in other software.<br/>
<br/>
New modes to the Fillet:<br/>
 # Trim and Join - join the two lines and Fillet into a single polyline<br/>
 # Fillet with largest radius - use the endpoints and angles of two lines being joined to determine the maximum radius (and join)<br/>
 # Tangent, Tangent, Radius - similar to above, allow selection of two lines and calculate the largest radius available between the two, auto fill that number, but allow user to manually enter a number below that maximum. (and join)<br/>
<br/>
Update Chamfer Mode selection<br/>
 Move Fillet mode selection out of settings and onto mode bar<br/>
<br/>
New Chamfer Mode:<br/>
 # For line length allow setting angle relative to line one, two, absolute.

<br/>
Preferences: For example, there are multiple sections within the Vectorworks Prefs, Doc Prefs and Spotlight Prefs.  Customers must know which one of the three to navigate to and then they need to find the preference they wish to change. New customers may not even know that there is an option to control a particular preference much less know where to find the preference.  By having an option to search prefs included in the QS, customers can quickly type and then be swiftly directed to the appropriate preference.  i.e. typing &quot;Off&quot; (offset) which auto-populates with &quot;Offset&quot;, &quot;Roller Chain - Offset Link&quot;, &quot;Roller Chain - Offset Link - 3D&quot; and now &quot;Offset Duplications&quot; which can be found in the Edit Section of the Vectorworks Prefs.  <br/>
<br/>
OIP: Rather than customers needing to scroll and scroll and scroll the OIP to find a particular setting, they can use the QS while an object is selected they will be directed to the appropriate place on the OIP.  Note the two pics of one OIP attached.  It is a lot of info to scroll through.  Reducing this time will benefit customers by saving them time and frustration.

<br/>
_sigh_<br/>
<br/>
My read of their reaction is that in a typical working situation, the default contextual hint &quot;icons only&quot; are too vague or mysterious for users to quickly digest and understand if the user is unfamiliar with the feature (which many users still are.)<br/>
<br/>
Once I tell people what those &quot;things&quot; are, how to use them, and how to invoke them, they have typically appreciated the Smart Options Display. However, I can&#39;t be there to tell everyone what they are. I have no doubt that many others are still puzzled or annoyed by them because they don&#39;t know what they are.<br/>
<br/>
But I have thought of a way that I believe will help boost their adoption and use...<br/>
<br/>
Changing the default &quot;Show initial Options as:&quot; from &quot;icons only&quot; to &quot;icons and text&quot; should, I believe, provide the visual cue to let users know what they are seeing and to them either use the S.O.D. or investigate further themselves. By adding the text to the S.O.D pop-up, users will have another cue (their native language) to engage with the feature, try it, and incorporate it into their workflows. <br/>

<br/>
It would be great –if it&#39;s not too complex to do– for this enhancement to be implemented in either 28.0.0 or perhaps in a SP update. The sooner we can get customers using our great  Smart Options Display, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.<br/>

<br/>
Right now typing an open round bracket after a function gives the user a preview of which parameters need to be used for it to work. The idea here is that the usage of a certain short-key would insert the complete function preview with placeholders. Often the programmer knows which function to use, but don&#39;t know or cannot see the actual variables because those are outside the visible code. But copying a variable (from somewhere else in the code) makes the preview disappear. So, with the preview inserted you can easily scroll up and down and copy paste strings without losing the function preview information and format.

Can we also please add support for sequential numbering. <br/>
<br/>
The objective here is to match the &#39;Title Block Sheet Data.Sheet Number&#39; field with the stacking position. This would support simpler workflows such as Interior Design and Events etc. where a drawing set need only be issued once and the drawing numbers need to reconcile with the PDF page numbers. Auto Coordination needs to be preserved, so the Sheet Number value needs to be used (ie; it&#39;s not sufficient to use the Page Number value).

<br/>
This isn&#39;t a huge deal until you start needing to import OBJs from a collaborating vendor multiple times a day. Then it becomes a huge headache, particularly if the imported models are dense meshes, and it takes several minutes to do these steps each and every time.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, having to manually rotate &amp; place the model removes any possibility of importing design iterations and automatically keeping the 0,0,0 origin in the same place upon each import.<br/>
<br/>
For reference, I&#39;ve attached a screengrab of Blender&#39;s OBJ import window which has settings for &quot;Forward&quot; and &quot;Up,&quot; meaning once I&#39;ve set these appropriately I never have to worry about it again. Blender is free, open-source software, and I&#39;d expect Vectorworks to be just as capable with a model format as common as OBJ.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, why is Vectorworks&#39; default &quot;Up&quot; axis for OBJ seemingly different than every single other software that handles OBJ? I&#39;ve never had a single one import in the expected orientation).

This usually results black surfaces covering the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, it would be helpful if there were separate options for importing fills and lines, so a user can choose to only import the lies in black, while the fills keep their original color.

Vectorworks is 35 years old and was the first CAD program to have built in reports. Yet in 2022 it is staggering that there is no way to paginate them. Presenting them nicely is crude and very manual and time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
For example I just had a new user create a report of plants with nice images along with other information ready for their client, and the list is long (this is a big project with many species). There is no easy way to do this. They were dumbstruck by this.<br/>
<br/>
It is staggering that they have to crudely and very time consumingly create many cropped viewports in order to do so. It is not the same when printing directly from a worksheet as users want to present them branded with their title blocks etc on a sheet. The discontinued add on &#39;Worksheet on Drawing&#39; could do this 20 years ago along with different colours for rows etc etc!<br/>
<br/>
It is virtually impossible for Spotlight users to present a worksheet with any finesse as they might have hundreds of rows to deal with (and don&#39;t want to buy Lightwright to do it for them).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

Open a vectorworks file and publish a sheet layer to PDF<br/>

Now print the same sheet layer to PDF ( go to print then save as a pdf )<br/>
<br/>
The two PDFs should be the same paper size. Notice the published PDF sheet has a much larger file size than the printed to PDF sheet<br/>
<br/>
I understand this is due to two different PDF engines being used - one for publish and one for print.<br/>
<br/>
It would be beneficial if publish PDF used the same engine as print, or least produced a smaller file size.<br/>
<br/>
Large size PDFs are difficult to share and sometimes collaborators cannot even open the files or find them so bulky they can&#39;t use them

It is not possible to store a chain hoist in a defined class. This will always be inserted in the active class when used.<br/>

This issue causes us additional effort to assign the chain hoists to the right classes manually. Sometimes we have to deal with hundreds of chain hoists.<br/>

For the truss symbols there is already a function &quot;Take classes from symbol&quot;. This function is urgently needed for hoists.<br/>

For trusses there is already an option in the &quot; Spotlight settings &quot;.<br/>

<br/>
It would be great if the colors used in Vectorworks were exported to the IFC file more often. We still have to create rules for objects with materials and textures, since many objects are provided with textures after all. But at the minimum it would be great if the colors and color channels of textures were exported.<br/>
<br/>
We think, the following color sources should be considered by the IFC Export:<br/>
 * Color defined in Attribute Palette (incl. color of class if defined &quot;by class&quot;) *-&gt; Currently, the only one supported.*<br/>
 * Color of Sub-Objects (e.g. Color of Component)<br/>
 * Color of texture if the Shader Color has clearly defined colors (e.g. Color, Obj Attribute)<br/>
 * Color of current Data Visualization (Like DWG/DXF Export)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t think it is necessairy to interpret a color from images of textures. In this case, it could ignore the image and only export the color as described above.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Marc

<br/>
This is also true of Eyedropper Tool, Revit import/export, and other settings.<br/>

There should be the option for users to check the box for all saved settlings instead of have to guess which ones will not migrate, and then manually copy the rest somehow.

Imagine the bath/shower tool. Baths typically are sized around 70cmx160cm to 90cmx180cm while showers are sized around 70cmx70cm to 120cmx90cm.<br/>
<br/>
If I want the possibility to edit the shower size manually I can&#39;t make the size parameters by style. So when I swap from a bath (80x180) to a shower I&#39;ll get a 80x180 shower... If I would check the &quot;Replace &#39;By Instance&#39; parameters&quot; box, I&#39;d get a shower sized like the default object style size, but I&#39;d be able to change that size by instance.

If I create a 3D viewport of the scene and render that VP in Shaded mode, it is also to blown out. I feel like I I should be allowed to change the Emitter brightness in the Lighting options of that VP, but currently, it does not affect it.<br/>
Likewise, we need overall brightness controls for Shaded mode in design layers.

Making this feature not workable.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Vectorworks could make use of the &#39;&amp;startIndex&#39; parameter. See here: [https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/430493/how-to-get-all-records-if-wfs-output-limited-to-1000]<br/>
 <br/>
From what I understand most GIS applications use this by default to get around the limitation. That&#39;s properly why it&#39;s not an issue for me to load the same source completely in Qgis. See attachment. Would be nice if VW recognize by itself that the limit has been reached and use the startIndex function to load the remaining data.<br/>

 * [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/95204-our-current-vw-irrigation-wishlist/#comment-428301] #6.<br/>
<br/>
In discussion with [~bgoff] yesterday, I believe we found an elegant way to accomplish this goal. Rather than worrying about getting irrigation emitters within a Plant Style Symbol. I think adding a tab to the plant style titled something like &quot;Water Use&quot;, &quot;Sustainability&quot; or &quot;Maintenance&quot; could allow us to define a plants maintenance and water needs in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
Looking specifically at water needs, This could be beneficial in several ways. Visualizations could be set to to easily determine if adjacent plant materials had compatible water use. This could also be used to define point source irrigation - in my experience, irrigation directed at a single plant can be accomplished in one of thee ways:<br/>
 # Dedicated bubblers - generally for trees, something like Root Watering Systems [https://www.rainbird.com/root-watering-system]<br/>
 # Point Source Emitters [https://www.hunterindustries.com/irrigation-product/micro-irrigation/point-source-drip-emitters]<br/>
 # or rings of drip emitter line [https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pinalcentral.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/db/9dbe68cd-fe63-55d3-875d-e953818d2eab/5e21dc5d5aae2.image.png?resize=400%2C224]<br/>
<br/>
To make this work, the irrigation portion of the new tab would require:<br/>
 # a pull-down on the irrigation tab for &quot;emitter style&quot; (pick one of the 3 above)<br/>
 ## &quot;Emitter Style parameters&quot;<br/>
 # a &quot;Supplimental Irrigation&quot; requirement, (maybe inches/week)<br/>
 # and an &quot;Establishment factor&quot; that would be some multiple of the supplemental Irrigation, generally allowed for the first year or two, depending on Jurisdiction<br/>
 # We would need to the ability to &quot;connect&quot; plant styles not covered in other irrigation - drip areas, or overhead spray directly to laterals or drip lines.<br/>
 # Callout of the emitters could be done with data tags.

<br/>
Yes, technically this is works as designed and the user may have caused this issue by unknowingly setting a parameter to by style when it should have been left as by instance.  But Bryan G. and Scott L. have determined that there are some plants in our default content that have parameters set to by style instead of instance, and that could easily cause this if added to a document.<br/>
<br/>
We need a way to allow the users to sync the by style/instance setting among all the plant styles to allow for mass modification of plant settings, they were easily able to do this in 2021 and have lost that ability now in 2022.

When using Laubwerk plants as 3D geometry in the plant tool - you cannot quickly change Laubwerk&#39;s 3D settings in the info palette.

                                            <td class="description">      The following Bug although it is in reality a Wish, it was requested to me to register this as a QRT Bug. This request comes from our biggest Customer (Knapp AG), which wants to upgrade several hundreds of users to 2023, but currently that is not be possible due to what is described in this report, hence the emergency to report this as a QRT Bug.<br/>
<br/>
Below is the original e-mail from Knapp AG (translated to english) and attached are the screenshots also sent by Knapp AG:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Since we want to switch from Vectorworks 2019 to Vectorworks 2023, we are now facing the problem that after installing Vectorworks, a Vectorworks account is now required to activate the license. However, since we have to manage several hundred users and licenses across the globe, there will be huge problems rolling out Vectorworks 2023 in our company. Unfortunately, I have to admit that our employees would probably be overwhelmed with that. Most of them will probably break down the door and ask us what they should enter there or why they have to do it all at once? It worked fine without it for years.<br/>
<br/>
By manually setting the &quot;First Time Run&quot; entry in the registry, you can skip the &quot;Sign In&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Nemetschek\Vectorworks 28\Registration<br/>
<br/>
We have a client-server solution for installing Vectorworks. We administrators set on the server which user should have a Vectorworks installed with which license. The client on the user&#39;s computer then automatically downloads the installer and installs VW in silent mode. In the course of this, we would then run a script at the end of the installation, which then makes the entry in the registry.<br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, this entry is only related to the user (HKEY_CURRENT_USER). In this way we would only prevent the account requirement for the user who carried out the installation. But if someone else then logs on to the computer and starts the VW, there is of course no registry entry for the current user and the sign-in dialog appears again.<br/>
 <br/>
While this won&#39;t happen often on users&#39; laptops, we also use Vectorworks a lot remotely.<br/>
We have over 10 terminal servers (+ graphics card) where Vectorworks is installed. The users do not always get on the same server, but are automatically redirected to the individual servers depending on the load. The Vectorworks is started directly. More than 100 users work with it every day. That would mean that in the initial phase they would have to register with an account on every server at some point.<br/>
<br/>
What Knapp AG needs is that the &quot;First Time Run&quot; key is not defined for the user, but that it can also be defined globally for the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why I wish it were possible to relate the entry &quot;First Time Run&quot; to the computer and not to the user. I tried making the entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. However, it had no effect. Vectorworks probably only looks at HKEY_CURRENT_USER for this.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Nemetschek\Vectorworks 28\Registration<br/>
<br/>
If this were possible, all our problems would be solved. We would then manually set the entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE during installation on the server. Any user who then starts a remote Vectorworks would then not notice anything about this account requirement and can work as normal as with previous versions. We wouldn&#39;t have to do any extra work with regard to accounts either.&quot;<br/>

These two parts correlate with the large flat surfaces we typically see when in a room, so when texturing we need to know whether we&#39;re looking at the Left or Right side of a wall.<br/>
<br/>
Currently it&#39;s only possible to differentiate which side is the Left vs the Right if you&#39;re in Top/Plan. This is done by looking for the blue arrow near one of the control handles, which indicates the starting point of the wall, and from there you can interpret which side is the Left vs the Right.<br/>
<br/>
However, texturing is typically done in 3D, and this arrow does not appear in 3D. There is currently no way to determine which is the Left vs Right side when looking at a Wall in 3D, so you can resort to trial and error (which is frustrating when you get it wrong) or you can switch to Top/Plan to check, but this interrupts the visual design workflow of your brain.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally one day the Texture tool will work on Walls, but that notwithstanding, it would be incredibly helpful to have an indicator of the Wall direction when viewing it in 3D.<br/>
<br/>
Attached are three images. The first shows an example of looking at a Wall in 3D and having no idea which side is Left vs Right. The second image shows that you can see a direction arrow when in Top/Plan. The third image show a mock-up of adding that same blue arrow in 3D which would fulfill the wish described here.

<br/>
The fundamental issue is that they often have to move trusses a small distance in response to Braceworks calculation results or changes requested by clients/venues but the the hung lights and other load objects hanging from the truss have to remain in their original locations. In 2019 and older it was possible <br/>
<br/>
Currently there is no easy way to move the truss without moving the connected objects. Once they are attached to the truss they will move with it no matter what auto-positioning and class/layer settings are used. selecting and moving the objects back to their original position has to be done manually, which depending on the method used can be error prone or very time consuming or both!<br/>
<br/>
In theory the manage loads tool allows the user to disconnect objects from the truss system but it will only function with one object at a time, not multiple objects.<br/>
<br/>
For BigRig the issue is a major problem due to the size of the productions they are involved with, they often have to manually move several hundred objects back to their original positions due to a small change to the truss positioning.<br/>
<br/>
I can see a couple of ways to approach this as an enhancement<br/>
 # add a context command to truss objects to allow them to move without moving the associated load objects<br/>
 # enhance the manage loads tool so that it can work with multiple selected objects at once<br/>
 # Add a setting in the Spotlight preferences in the loads and rigging pane to allow trusses to move without the attached load objects, maybe with a shortcut key<br/>

The crew member then places the hoist, connects the cable.<br/>
<br/>
Since the plan is to have the Cable &amp; Power Planning layout tools specify the needed cables, this cable length field should be filled in by the C&amp;PP tool. However, this field should be user-editable to allow riggers who are not using power planning to add their needed cable lengths.<br/>

Adding a menu option to the worksheet&#39;s file menu of &quot;Find in Drawing&quot; would likely be an often-used option. Alternatively, having an &quot;Activate Layer&quot; would also solve the problem.<br/>

Additionally, when browsing worksheets in the resource manager it would be equally useful to have a &quot;Locate in Drawing&quot; function. Perhaps added to the right-click menu.<br/>

                Meshes need to retain texture mapping when edited or converted to group
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Inspired by this thread: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/89533-photogrammetry/]<br/>
<br/>
but also an issue I&#39;ve run into repeatedly when using Meshes...<br/>
<br/>
With the rise of photogrammetry along with the general increased presence of imported Mesh objects in Vectorworks files over the last several years, it has become apparent that the software needs to let the user break apart or modify Mesh objects without losing the imported texture mapping.<br/>
<br/>
Since Vectorworks is {*}already importing per-face texture mapping{*}, shouldn&#39;t it be possible to retain that same mapping on each 3D Polygon when the mesh is edited or exploded? (For example: double clicking the mesh to edit its contents, or Converting the Mesh to Group). Currently either of these operations causes the Mesh to become untextured, meaning a user has very little ability to modify imported Meshes to suite the project&#39;s needs. This severely limits the usability of imported Meshes, especially those generated via photogrammetry where additional editing is almost always desired (such as deleting unwanted portions). A user is essentially stuck with Mesh as is, which is very bad for a *design* program.<br/>
<br/>
Another operation that should retain per-face mapping is selecting multiple Meshes and running the &quot;Convert to Mesh&quot; command in order to combine them into one Mesh.<br/>
<br/>
This not only affects imported Meshes from other software such as SketchUp, but also textured Meshes generated by the &quot;Photos to 3D Model&quot; feature of Vectorworks Cloud Services. I&#39;ve had limited success using those generated Meshes since I can&#39;t DO anything with them.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks wants to continue to be the great unifier of cross-platform compatibility, then Mesh editability needs to be addressed.<br/>

For example: Acer campestre - the texture exists but is not used in the Plant styles (it contains Rhus typhina)<br/>

Maybe the library with the Species Specific plants could use a double check - which Image Props can be updated with the Photorealistic textures<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Here is how the Plant currently works:<br/>
When a Plant is created over a Site Model or a Plant over a Site Model is recalculated, the plants (each of its plant symbols) are automatically sent to the Site Model surface. I.e. internally, during the recalculation of the Plant, the plant symbols will automatically conform (adjust elevations) to the Site Model surface and it is done whenever the Plant is above a Site Model.<br/>
<br/>
Note that *there is no option to control this behavior - the plant symbols always conform to the first found Site Model* (over the Plant area).<br/>
<br/>
Calling the Send to Surface command for a Plant object only triggers object recalculation, thus, it only ensures that the plant symbols conform to the Site Model surface (for example, in cases when Plant position or Site Model position have changed).<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to *allow &quot;disconnecting&quot; the Plant object from sending (of its plant symbols) to the surface and along with it their current elevations to be &quot;locked&quot;*, i.e. the next recalculation to not make the plants elevations zeros but to keep them as if they are still adjusting to the surface as it was at the time of locking.

Thus the ability to save specific settings in a &quot;Style Manager&quot; such as in the site model dialog or Data Viz dialog. These could then be applied presetting the choices for the user offering a better user experience.

<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/97724-persistent-none-class/]<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Light objects can&#39;t have their fill set to anything except &quot;Solid&quot; which is good because nothing else would make sense for a Light (in fact I wish the Fill dropdown were disabled entirely).<br/>
<br/>
However, Heliodons are not limited in this way and can be set to any type of Fill in the Attributes Palette. This fill affects both the 2D label text AND the Heliodon&#39;s internal light. This is confusing and could be improved.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, for example, if you want the label to have a blue background fill, it also makes the internal Light emit blue light. Or if you want the Heliodon&#39;s Light output to be a sunset orange, you also end up with an orange label.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, if you set the fill to None, the internal Light still retains the fill color, which is what confusingly happened in Michal&#39;s in the thread linked above (which was further complicated but the use of &quot;By Class&quot; attributes).<br/>
<br/>
Since Heliodon&#39;s are a special type of Light, their Fill settings should behave the same as regular Lights (always be a Solid Color). And since the 2D Heliodon representation is ALREADY symbol-based, the attributes of the text should just come from the text object in the Heliodon Symbol.

<br/>
A similar behavior is required for the Hardscape. However, due to the fact that Hardscape has borders (curbs) where the bottom of their lowest components might not follow the bottom of the main area lowest component, we decided that the cut&amp;fill surface should comply with the main area lowest component:<br/>
 !hardscape-cut&amp;fill-3.jpg|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Note that the Hardscape can behave as a modifier (unlike the Landscape Area, which conforms to the Site Model surface).<br/>
For this reason, a choice between 3 options will be added:<br/>
- Acts as modifier<br/>
- Conforms to site model and cuts volume for subsurface components<br/>
- Acts as modifier and cuts volume for subsurface components<br/>
<br/>
When cutting volume for its subsurface components (when applied on the Site Model), the cut&amp;fill surface will follow the same rule as shown on the above picture.

<br/>
The slab drainage&#39;s geometry is defined by using the Slab Drainage Tool in the Building Shell Tool set. Drainage points are inserted which provide custom slopes and result in arbitrary geometry for the slab drainage.<br/>
<br/>
The geometry of the pad modifier, aligned modifier or the path modifier which is applied to the site model is not influenced by the drainage geometry and can be different. This can be seen in files &#39;slab drainage aligned.vwx&#39; and &#39;slab drainage path.vwx&#39;. Therefore, when 3D Type is Slab Drainage, the Use site modifier option should be disabled. Instead, a new check option should be added for the slab drainage which would allow it to provide its geometry as modifier for the site model.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the slab drainage geometry is calculated in the function DrawSlabDrainage in Hardscape/Utilities.cpp. The main area geometry is stored inside a Slab parametric object inside the First list of the hardscape. It contains Slab nodes for flat components and CSG Tree nodes for components which have arbitrary geometry.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that the slab drainage can have tapered components as it can be seen in &#39;slab drainage tapered.png&#39;. Also it should be noted that the hardscape border does not work well with slab drainage when the surface is not flat as it can be seen in &#39;slab drainage border.png&#39;.

Today, this is a totally manual process if you want to do it in Vectorworks, and hence many practices are moving this to different software.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A user could set this up similarly to the slope analysis - specifying the number of bands, the intervals, and what colors to associate with them.<br/>
<br/>
It would also be useful to have an automated key, similar to how the DataViz is showing applied attributes.<br/>
<br/>
It would also be good to have the same effect as 3D graphics. This would help for the analysis stage for large sites.<br/>

The current effort at Vectorworks, Inc is to move toward using Data Tags for all labelling/data display needs, but I don&#39;t see or hear any indication that supporting images in Data Tags is on the road map. <br/>
<br/>
I suggest that either the scope of the statement in Vectorworks Help manual needs to be reeled in, or adding support for images to Data Tags should be added to the road map. <br/>
<br/>
This finding came about when I was helping a user get around a problem with the Plant Tool&#39;s plant tags, so I&#39;d like to hear back about this in case it changes the advice I give them or other users. <br/>

As per [this thread in the Distributor Forum|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/90469-t02271-shaded-rendering-improvements/#comment-414254] in the new improvements for Shaded rendering in v2023.<br/>
<br/>
If these improvements eventuate for Shaded renders, users will want to quickly explore different types of lighting on the model immediately. Currently the only way to save lighting set ups and combinations for a scene is via the Visualisation Palette for individual viewports. <br/>
<br/>
The wish is the ability for users to be able to save lighting set ups via Saved Views. That would allow all types of designers across all industries immediate display of lighting ideas as they navigate the model in the design layer environment.<br/>
<br/>
This task will open up a world of discovery to designers as they communicate their designs to clients. Interior designers and architects, exhibition and set designers in particular will want to quickly go from one combination of lighting to another. <br/>
<br/>
It is important for designers to stay in Vectorworks and not have to use another program to show lighting effects and combinations. Vectorworks would remain as the main communication tool. For example, in film production Rhino has been eating into the Vectorworks market for production design with external renderers and to have this ability built into Vectorworks would add to our bow. <br/>

<br/>
Target should have been 2023, but this is no longer possible, so I vote for 2024 at the latest. Solving this would also make multi-lining possible in the expert formula field in the data manager, where formulas can get quite extensive and overwhelming. Multi-lining would help much in this regard to get a much clearer picture of what is happening in the formula.

                                            <td class="description">      _&quot;A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is *a representation of the bare ground (bare earth) topographic surface of the Earth excluding trees*, buildings, and any other surface objects. DEMs are created from a variety of sources. USGS DEMs used to be derived primarily from topographic maps.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The ability to import and export DEM files is a heavily requested feature that dates back to 2008, possibly earlier (see below for requests on the forum).<br/>
<br/>
I would see this being available for Landmark and potentially Architect. The workflow would be to go to either File&gt;Import&gt;Import DEM or Landmark&gt;Survey Import&gt;DEM. Commands could be added to the DEM object to allow:<br/>
 * extraction of contours and/or points (xyz)—specified by unit (i.e. 10ft contours). Use this as source data to create a site model.<br/>
 * or automatically convert DEM to site model<br/>
<br/>
The existing Site Model could have an added option:<br/>
 * 2D Display: DEM (Digital Elevation Model)<br/>
<br/>
This could be exported as a DEM and then used for programs like arcGIS, Lumion, Twinmotion, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At present, users typically have to use a different application like QGIS or Blender to import DEM files, extract objects, then bring into Vectorworks. In the video I recorded, I show the process for importing a DEM into QGIS&gt; extract contours&gt; export shapefile&gt; import shapefile into Vectorworks&gt; Modifiy by record (elevate 2D poly)&gt; create site model from source data.<br/>

Ability to locate a referenced item in a file by right-clicking on referenced file within Navigation Palette&gt;References and have the option to &quot;go to reference&quot; similar to what is available in InDesign for &quot;go to link&quot; seen in the attached example *Go To Link-sample.jpeg*. (The option sits above the bolded Embed Link).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is useful because it is quite typical for Reed Hilderbrand to have 50-80 references in a Vectorworks files of images, pdfs, vectorworks files, dwgs all referenced into their main file. If they can simply right-click and select &quot;Go to reference&quot; and it selects the object in their file it&#39;ll make it much easier to locate objects. Similar to force selecting an object that you don&#39;t know which design layer or class it resides on.

<br/>
Attached is an example of Graphic Legend criteria, where I&#39;ve had to manually identify external doors by IDSuffix. But this is prone to error because if somebody adds an external door to the model they need to remember to update the Graphic Legend criteria to include it.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a standard and highly visible way to identify doors as being external then this error could be avoided. It could also mean that any external door styles that are duplicated to create a new one would also be identified as external by default (a desirable behaviour).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps as simple as a check button in the _Door Style &gt; General_ dialogue window?

He regularly works on large scale productions as the rigging designer/technical planner and his preferred workflow for Braceworks is to have a separate file for the rigging calculations that he then copies the hoists and rigging from into a master file.<br/>
With the old hoist object he was able to copy and paste the hoists between the files and maintain the attached Braceworks calculation results related data, this is no longer possible with the new hoist as everytime a hoist is duplicated it resets its name, id and UUID, losing the calculation related data.<br/>
<br/>

Also, the alignment of Elevation Benchmark objects will move the measurement point too. It would be great if the measurement point would keep it&#39;s position and it will only move the marker itself. Exactly this behavoir is already possible with Data Tags if the are associated with objects.

I have attached charts showing various types of connectors. <br/>
<br/>
Each consumer device needs to have ownership of the connector regardless of the circuit it is patched to via the power planning workflow. Having the light have one connector while having the distributor, cable, or breakout have a different one will allow for automated insertion of cable connector adapters.<br/>

I was making a Graphic Legend in an empty file. I edited the Title Layout as I wanted to colour the title background.<br/>
<br/>
As per the screen shot it looks like a regular rectangle (although described in the OIP as a &#39;Title Frame in Graphic Legend&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
It is counter-intuitive as I thought that I could simply treat it as a rectangle and change the fill colour etc but nothing changed. So I filed a bug:<br/>
<br/>
VB-189409<br/>
Graphic Legends: Virgin GL unable to colour the background rectangle of the Title<br/>
<br/>
Obviously rejected as it WAD. So this requesat is that this default display *should not look* like a regular rectangle, but one say with dashed lines as per my mock up screenshot. This is more in common with this type of object and makes it more intuitive for users. It fooled me, a beta tester of 26 years!<br/>

<br/>
Add a Report bug item in the help menu that would automatically populate a bug submit form with the version, OS, and contact info, as well as upload the current drawing file, the user log, and a snapshot of the drawing window. Reporting a bug would be as easy as typing in a title and description.<br/>
<br/>
While some bugs require more explanation or preliminary testing, this would be perfect for straightforwards annoyances or malfunctions, as well as make bug reporting more accessible for general users.

<br/>
The Spotlight&gt;Visualisation&gt;Set Spotlight Rendering Options dialogue globally affects all lighting devices in a drawing. Yet even if all Lighting Devices in a drawing are all using lit fog for example and the design layer is already rendered, when you open the dialogue the lit fog option is unchecked. Yet the Renderworks background is correctly indicated in the dialogue. It seems unintuitive so much so that I thought it was a bug (it turned off the lit fog which was already on). This made me report: <br/>
<br/>
[Vectorworks BugsVB-191399|VB-191399]<br/>
Spotlight&gt;Visualisation&gt;Set Spotlight Rendering Options... dialogue kills lit fog. However this is WAD hence this VE.<br/>
<br/>
The VE is that the dialogue has some different options/selection criteria.<br/>
 * That it reflects all of the current rendering state of the current render eg lit fog, Renderworks background etc.<br/>
 * If there is a mixture of some lighting devices using lit fog, some not, fall off with a mixture of none/realistic/smooth then the lit fog and fall off should be greyed out. This is in keeping with current conventions.<br/>
 * That there are options to select and therefore affect Lighting Devices by other criteria eg lit fog, position, purpose, fall off, on or off and so on. This makes the dialogue much more powerful and versatile. At the moment it is all or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I realise this is low priority but it would be very useful with it being more adaptable.<br/>

It seems pretty common for viewports on the same sheet to use the same benchmark setup, so being able to edit mode than one at a time would be a big time-saver. Other  viewport buttons (Advanced Properties, Classes, render settings, etc) seem to handle multiple selection without a problem.

<br/>
Users either have to individually add it as annotation in each cell or draw it over the top of the Graphic Legend.  Neither method is satisfactory.<br/>
<br/>
What we need is an option with door and window schedules to automatically draw a floor line in each cell for the width of the cell.  That way there won&#39;t be a disconnect occur when a cell height changes.  It needs to be classed separately so the user can define its graphic attributes - line thickness, line type and colour.  There also needs to be an option to include the text FL at the left hand end of each line.<br/>
<br/>
We need things to be as automatic as possible and error free.  Adding drawing elements manually<br/>

Diametrical and diametral are both acceptable terms (along with diametric), but Vectorworks should choose one and stick with it for consistency. In my opinion, &quot;diametrical&quot; is best.

Please can we have the ability like Title Block Borders to scale a Graphic Legend so it can fit on the page?<br/>

In the enclosed screenshot you can see a Graphic Legend that has been formatted to one&#39;s liking. However, it is slightly too big to fit on the page. Changing anything about the Graphic Legend will most likely change the cell layouts which is not desirable.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that there is a scale option in the OIP so users can put in a multiplication factor in order to scale it. In this example it might be &#39;0.9&#39; for example. Just like title blocks etc.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
we need to improve the way we align truss corners. It is very difficult to control the direction in which a truss corner is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
You often have to change the view to get control over the orientation of the corner. Even then, it is not always possible to bring the corner into the desired orientation. As a result, the customer loses a lot of time when drawing elaborate truss constructions. Especially with corners that have more than 2 ways, it becomes a matter of chance whether the corner sits correctly or not. The rotating tool helps here in the rarest cases.<br/>
<br/>
The magnets are a great tool for creating non-rectangular connections, but do not help with a corner that can be rotated 360° because they are not fixed.<br/>
<br/>
We hear this behavior a lot here in tech support and we don&#39;t have a good solution for it. Some users are frustrated because they take too long to draw.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached video I try to provide orientation in all 4 directions. This is very tedious.<br/>
<br/>

Greetings<br/>

This is sometimes useful, but other times can be problematic, as the image might show something with fixed proportions, and therefore the X and Y always want to scale proportionally with each other (which can be done by grabbing a corner point and holding shift). However, if at some point the Bitmap was inadvertently stretched along only one axis, the proportions are now incorrect and there&#39;s no way to reset it. The only reliable fix is to import the original image once again. However, if you don&#39;t HAVE the original image file, then you&#39;re sort of screwed.<br/>
<br/>
There needs to be a simple way to reset the proportions / aspect ratio back to the original image. Example file attached.

<br/>
{color:#FF0000}*The most important one for us is item 4. Without item 4 implemented we won&#39;t be able to use Graphic Legend for windows legends, because we work to structural openings and we need to dimension to the floor. Please, we&#39;re so close!!!*{color}<br/>
 # I don&#39;t think the dropdown menu listing various combinations of dimensions is the right way to go. This requires that Vectorworks second guess the combinations its users may want. And, to prove a point, the combination I want is not there (i.e. rough opening + sill to floor). While it&#39;s conceivable that you may be able to provide a list of all the combinations users may want, I think it would be much more desirable (and more intuitive) if instead of a requiring a single choice, we could simply check or uncheck the types we want and make our own combinations.<br/>
 # It would be extremely useful if we could override auto-dimension settings for a single cell. Or perhaps the ability to go into a cell and simply delete dimensions (and not have them regenerate?)? There are many examples where I might want to show sash dimensions in some cells but not others, for instance.<br/>
 # Missing auto-dimension types:<br/>
 ## Unit size (i.e. &#39;rough opening minus shim gaps&#39;). I thought Frame might be &#39;rough opening minus shim gaps&#39; but it doesn&#39;t seem to be, or perhaps there&#39;s something peculiar about my window jamb configurations? Because Frame provides a much smaller dimension than &#39;rough opening minus shim gaps&#39;.<br/>
 ## Mullions and Transoms. We don&#39;t really dimension to sashes. We dimension to rough openings and when want to show a correlation of heights across different windows we generally dimension to a transom, not the sash.<br/>
 # {color:#FF0000}Missing combinations:{color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening + Sill to floor [sill in this case being the bottom of the rough opening){color}<br/>

I had just rebooted my machine and opened Vectorworks 2022 SP3B2. <br/>
<br/>
With an extremely simple test model with one Renderworks Spotlight pointing to a chair in a room, I noticed that all Renderworks options (Artistic, Fast, Final Quality, Custom, Styled etc) only showed the Shaded render. Even the &#39;B&#39; key X-Ray mode wasn&#39;t working correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I then realised that Cineware by Maxon had crashed and/or failed to launch which I confirmed with Activity Monitor.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that if this happens an error message could come up saying something like: &quot;there has been a problem with the rendering engine please quit and re-launch the program&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, how else would the user know? In this situation it is just a bad user experience with users being unable to fathom why they aren&#39;t getting the results they expected. This was in spite of there being a tick appearing to show that those rendering modes were being used at the time<br/>

Movie and file enclosed. I don&#39;t know if Cineware by Maxon creates any crash logs?<br/>

The softgoods has a pull down so they could click on that and access the Resource Selector and immediately find a favourite file with those drapes. However if doing the same for any of the above it is not possible. The only way is via the Resource Manager.<br/>
This is inconsistent and a mixed workflow, hence the wish that the pull down be available for all tools.<br/>

As more users get access to Vision in the future, more lighting rigs with conventional instruments will be exported to it.<br/>

Lighting Designers (LD) use the colour field in the OIP to colour the rig.<br/>
<br/>
Currently if it is exported to Vision this colour (gel) information does not come across. This means that LDs would have to tediously re-enter the gel colour in Vision for every conventional instrument. It seems very strange that such a fundamental part of the design process and central to plotting cues for a show, has to be doubled up with such an effort in order to use Vision.<br/>

This VE is that the colour field in the OIP gets pushed out to the &#39;Colour wheel 1 slot 1&#39; part of the Lighting Device Edit dialogue so that it can immediately be used in Vision.<br/>

This VE is to ask that each symbol has the appropriate kilonewton force applied. Currently no matter what the capacity is of the symbol via it&#39;s name, they are all set to 5kN. This is tedious to have to manually change each one after placement and is something that could produce errors.<br/>
Also, it would be good to be able to have an auto numbering option like the Hoist tool has in order for easy identification for users. These small tweaks would make using the tool much more efficient.<br/>

The MVR format promises great things including two-way updating of geometry and lighting device changes between the two programs. However this is not possible at the moment.<br/>

Often it is only when plotting a show that a lighting designer realises they have to physically adjust a lighting instrument&#39;s position, or colour perhaps, or if designing a set maybe move parts of the set for example.<br/>
<br/>
To be able to make those adjustments in Vision and export via MVR so that those changes can be imported back into Vectorworks is the reason for this VE.<br/>

We just had a long term user give us a blast about some of the Help. I tried not being too defensive as I know the Help is wonderful and greatly appreciate the efforts put in by the publishing team and I appreciate how difficult it is to explain certain concepts clearly. It is also a great selling point to potential customers, and can appease existing ones!<br/>
<br/>
However this page: <br/>
https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2022/eng/VW2022_Guide/Basic2/Using_working_planes.htm<br/>
<br/>
Has an excellent 1st paragraph (that I show in my own notes for 3D modelling courses) but this VE is for the 2nd paragraph to be possibly reconsidered. It says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When modeling in 3D, the &quot;working&quot; plane is the 3D plane where geometry is placed, and where the cursor snaps to when no other 3D snap is active (the cursor is not snapping to 3D geometry). The working plane can be on the layer plane, or in any other orientation required. When the working plane is not on the layer plane, it becomes visible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The part I think is not clear and which is confusing is: &quot;...and where the cursor snaps to when no other 3D snap is active (the cursor is not snapping to 3D geometry).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I get the idea and sort of know what you&#39;re getting at but it adds a veneer of gobbledegook (sorry) that confuses users.<br/>
<br/>
Might it be considered to drop this or reword if really really necessary?!<br/>
<br/>

However, there are times where a user may need additional detail compared to what&#39;s displayed here. For example, I needed information about how to edit the Clip Cube but there&#39;s nothing about it on this pane.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, at the bottom of the &quot;?&quot; pane there should be a link to the full Help page for the relevant topic (either [View 3D models of .vwx files|https://cloud.vectorworks.net/portal/help/pages/view-3d-models-of-vwx-files/?app=IOS_NOMAD] or [View 3D models in AR|https://cloud.vectorworks.net/portal/help/pages/view-3d-models-in-ar/?app=IOS_NOMAD]). This would open in the default browser.<br/>
<br/>
Currently a user has to exit the &quot;?&quot; pane, exit the model viewer, click Account, Click Help, then find the relevant page. (That is, if the user even knows these great Help pages even exist in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
Not only would adding a link in the viewer increase discoverability, but that way the 3D model would remain open in the viewer so it&#39;s easy to jump back in where the user left off.

<br/>
In DropdownExample2.png you can see that the background of the dropdown box is translucent and appears on top of adjacent settings. This makes it hard to read since there&#39;s overlapping visual information.

Compare rendering in OprnGL/Shaded and Renderworks. Shaded inverts the shadow, as well as treat the color as bitmap. The next generation of shaded would, ideally:<br/>
<br/>
- Not invert the shadow<br/>
- Allow for full color and grayscale projection<br/>
- Provide a legacy mode for those who have crafted Shaded renders on the existing behavior.<br/>

<br/>
For many objects this makes sense - Doors, windows, walls, furniture etc. For objects that need to maintain their Z position relative to the layer origin this functionality works.<br/>
<br/>
For many other types of objects, no matter which layer they are on, their world Z position should remain unchanged when moved from layer to layer.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks does not have a function that allows an object to maintain its absolute position when moved between layers.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very useful to have the option to lock an object&#39;s Z value when moved between layers.<br/>
<br/>
My current work around for this lack of functionality is to have the source layer visible and target layer active and then group and ungroup the object. The group will be created on the active layer and will not move its Z position. Unfortunately, this can break constraints between objects.<br/>

<br/>
This file has too many jumper cables.<br/>
<br/>
When using break-Outs on a truss, we often have times when we do not need jumpers to connect to nearby lights. Since break-Outs come with cables, they can connect directly.<br/>
<br/>
in the attached test file, I have drawn a red 10-foot radius circle around the breakout. Since the breakout has 10-foot tails (cables with connectors), all lights within the 10-foot radius circle can be connected directly to the output circuits of the breakout. Therefore, jumper cables are not needed for these lights.<br/>
<br/>
We need a way to connect the break-out without adding the extra cables to lights within either a symbol specified or user defined distance.

The Hoist should take on their symbol class when they are inserted. This already works for trusses and spotlights, now we would like to have this for Hoist as well. And maybe we can combine this in one place. Currently you set it for trusses in the tool, for spotlights in the spotlight document settings.<br/>

Automatically created classes like &quot;chain link&quot; should be able to be inserted into your own class structure with prefixed text like it is possible for spotlights.<br/>

here is a wish from a customer.<br/>
Customer creates a chain dimension by typing in the values using the floating data bar.<br/>
As long as the mouse pointer is in line with the chain dimension, this workflow is working.<br/>
The moment the mouse is not in line, the value is not correct. I know, this is WAD.<br/>
The wish is to lock the mouse to be in line with the chain dimension.<br/>
See video and testfile.<br/>

<br/>
In the Worksheet Formula Builder, &#39;Config&#39; is not an option in the pull down field menu. &#39;Configuration&#39; is, but that is the &quot;type&quot; of door (Swing, Slide, Etc) while the &#39;Config&#39; field is the detail of the operation (Single swing, double swing, X0X, etc.).  There are individual fields for the operation of each type of door (&#39;Door&#39;.&#39;SwingOperation&#39;,  &#39;Door&#39;.&#39;SliderOperation&#39;), but &#39;Config&#39; appears to be the Operation of the currently selected door type.  &#39;Config&#39; is a very useful function for Door Schedules and should be included in the drop down menu.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For the bigger picture, while &#39;Door&#39;.&#39;Config&#39; appears to be hidden in the OIP and the individual Operation fields are displayed depending on which type of door is selected. This makes me think that &#39;Config&#39; is hidden in the OIP. This is confirmed by the field having a display name of &quot;__NNA_DO_NOT_CHANGE&quot; (as shown by my handy dandy script that makes a worksheet showing all of the PIO Record fields).<br/>
<br/>
There needs to be an additional way to mark PIO fields that will let them be hidden from showing in the OIP, but still allow them to be displayed in worksheets. Even a read only version would be useful to Report information that is contained in the record.<br/>

 *  classes<br/>
 * component names<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these systems produce a satisfactory result.<br/>
 * Classes are already used extensively to control the visibility and graphical appearance of objects. In BIM workflows, SfB classes are indispensable. Replacing the SfB classes with VMSW codes would cripple the workflow. Appending the VMSW codes to the class is not possible, as there&#39;s no logical mapping. It would also create incorrect SfB class names when exported to IFC.<br/>
 * Names of the components show up in a BIM-workflow. In some cases, the components names need to be selected in an interface. Having the VMSW codes instead of readable names hampers the workflow.<br/>
<br/>
There is more than one solution to this problem, but the most obvious one seems to be ‘tagging.’ Vectorworks already allows tags for resources, classes, layers and more. This is a great workaround to attach non-specified information to objects. Extending tag support to the components of any component based object (walls, slabs, roofs) would provide an elegant solution.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Remark: please also check the NCS plugin (UK market). Maybe there are NCS codes that could benefit from component specific tagging.

                Default for Design layers in stories: &#39;no level&#39;

<br/>
When adding a Story to a Vectorworks file, you can decide which Design layers should be created with it. These Design layers expect a level. This level needs to be unique: you cannot have 2 (3, 4, ...) Design layers using the same level.<br/>
<br/>
*Customer expectation*<br/>
<br/>
However, in reality, customers expects those Design layers almost always to reference the &#39;zero&#39; level of the story. For that, no level is needed - the &#39;zero&#39; of the story suffices. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
 * Basement:<br/>
 * One layer for the strip footing and/or foundation slab.<br/>
 * One layer for the foundation and basement walls (to avoid wall connection conflicts with the slab ‘walls’)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Ground floor:<br/>
 * Floor slabs<br/>
 * Walls<br/>
 * Interior elements<br/>
 * Dropped ceiling<br/>
<br/>
In all of these cases, the Design layers refer to the same level: the ‘zero’ of the Story. This is to avoid confusion for the user (based on observations from training sessions).<br/>
<br/>
To accomplish this &lt;no level&gt; setup today, a user has to:<br/>
 * Create a Design layer<br/>
 * Link it to a Story<br/>
 * Select &lt;no level&gt;<br/>
 * Set the offset from the Story to zero<br/>
 * Confirm, and drag the Design layer to the right spot in the layer list<br/>
<br/>
What the user wants to do, is:<br/>
 * Create a Story<br/>
 * Pick the associated Design Layers<br/>
 * They all refer to the base height of the story. By default, they have &lt;no level&gt;<br/>
 * The default offset for the Design Layers is zero.<br/>
 * Only if need be, can the customer select a Design layer specific level, or change the offset.<br/>
<br/>
*Back story*<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a Design layer for the dropped ceiling. It has its own level, set at 260 cm above story level. The user starts drawing in the Design layer, and all ceilings are on the correct height.<br/>
<br/>
But then someone else takes over. Or the project is halted for a few months, and the original user doesn&#39;t remember the project settings exactly anymore. They start modifying the ceilings, decide that the ones in the toilet areas need to be 20 cm lower. They then have to give the ceiling objects an offset of -20 cm. <br/>
<br/>
While this makes perfect sense from the outside, in reality it leads to confusion and frustration from the customer (this is feedback from support and training staff). Customers are much more at ease with a Ceiling design layer that:<br/>
 * Has the same zero level as the story<br/>
 * When placing an object on that Design layer, they can see the offset of 260 cm in the OIP (and immediately understand this is the floor-to-ceiling height)<br/>
 * When they want to lower certain parts, they just change the offset in the OIP to 240 cm (or 20 cm lower)<br/>
<br/>
*Alternative solution: allow Design layers to use the same level*<br/>
<br/>
Upon Story creation, allow the Design layers to be linked to the same level type. This will still be an improvement upon the current situation. There will still be a level that has the same &#39;zero&#39; as the story, but at least it will be limited to only one such level (instead of a series of duplicates of that level, all having a different name).

<br/>
There doesn&#39;t currently seem to be an option to filter objects based on FILL STYLE. This seems like it would be a rudimentary criterion that should exist.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I want to select all objects that have a hatch fill (_any_ hatch fill). Not currently possible.<br/>
<br/>
Or I want to select polygons whose Fill Style is set to None. Not possible.<br/>
<br/>
These are basic scenarios.

This is confusing to the customer. He doesn&#39;t expect the level to duplicate. When creating new Stories, he sees two levels with the same name (but different heights). This can lead to mistakes.<br/>

Our training and support staff believes it is better to not create duplicates.

We can adjust the rendering style per design layer saved view so it would be good that the next logical step would be to change the renderworks background used per saved view. <br/>

<br/>
The following VE&#39;s are from an in person meeting in the US between the training team, industry specialists and onboarding specialists.<br/>
<br/>
Exploring an alternate workflow more suited to the temporary (non-installation) nature of concert touring, Theatre and Corporate events customers typified by our existing entertainment product customers.  <br/>
<br/>
These customers often place equipment in a model prior to designing the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
An Event Designer would likely place the Speaker and Video objects within the model first to facilitate showing a client a rendered model or 2d plan. Once this user has &#39;mocked up&#39; the event they can use the existing &quot;Create Devices from Worksheet&quot; command to commence working on the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
We would like customers to be able to create devices from plug in objects already within the file.<br/>
<br/>
This  process would throw up a few challenges.<br/>
<br/>
What if there was a light plot with 200 fixtures? The user would not need to create devices for those but perhaps only the AV elements. <br/>
<br/>
So Some kind of filtering would be required, either by object type but I also wonder if by layer  would be preferable<br/>
<br/>
How would the device builder know which devices to use for their respective schematic devices?<br/>
<br/>
We should discuss this. The existing Screen, Video Wall and projector tools lack consistency with regards to make and model information. Speakers and camera&#39;s are probably more reliable when it comes to make and model. It would  be good if the user could be prompted through this process and effectively &#39;Manually Map&#39; items which are missing make and model info.<br/>
<br/>
One workflow to suggest is that prior to running the newly suggested command (Create from PIO&#39;s or this file or maybe a referenced file). The user could attach the equipment item object to each of the PIO&#39;s they wish to make a schematic device for using the equipment item tool thereby predefining and selecting which devices to create. This does not solve the Make and Model issue as this information will need to be entered manually and it would be good for the equipment item tool to extract this information from the PIO where possible.<br/>
<br/>
There may still be customers who wish to keep their schematics in a separate file from their event design. Could this workflow utilise an external (separate) or Xref file as the source equipment items and command be run that creates schematic devices in their preferred separate schematics file?

We would like to add similar functionality that can currently be found with the fence/railing tool to the existing ConnectCAD Cable Path Tool.<br/>
<br/>
A user can create a cable path in exactly the same way but upon completion a style can be assigned to the path.<br/>
<br/>
Examples can include cable tray, conduit.<br/>
<br/>
Other suggestions could be that an inventory of required cable tray and conduit equipment can be created from the path and also anywhere a cable tray or conduit passes through a wall or obstacle then a suitable hole could be cut and removed from the wall/obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
A style could be created for fibre optic cable path. The style could also restrict path movement due to lack of fibre bend when creating the path.<br/>
<br/>
This task does not fall directly within the remit of connectCAD but its improvements could rapidly improve the current MEP workflow requirements for architecture and Entertainment.

 * At the very minimum, open the dialog directly underneath the &quot;New&quot; button<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      There are many cases where a record or field name can easily be generated by string functions such as Concat. One prime example is Title Block Border Revisions data. Each time a revision is added, a new Record format with the same base name and an appended number is created.<br/>
<br/>
So when you have three revisions added to a TBB your have three records.<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-1<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-2<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-3<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is easy to use a concat function to generate the overall record name, but currently as of VW2023 there is no way to use the generated string as the record name in a formula.  So if you concatenate the overall name into cell B1, you can not use a formula like<br/>
<br/>
=B1.&#39;Date&#39;<br/>
<br/>
You have to use the full written version of<br/>
<br/>
=&#39;Title Block Revision Data-3&#39;.&#39;Date&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We would like to have function added that will take a string and cause that string to be used in place of literal text as part of or as a complete function.<br/>
<br/>
This would be something like the Eval function in Vectorscript.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So a worksheet formula of<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1.&#39;Date&#39;)  would take the string from B1 and use that as the Record name.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, Eval could require a string of the complete function, similar to how Vectorscript Criteria can be generated by making a string containing the entire criteria, but won&#39;t work using just a portion.<br/>
<br/>
VarName:=&#39;This Layer Name&#39;;<br/>
<br/>
((L=VarName)) does not work.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
VarName:=&#39;L=&#39;&#39;&#39;ThisLayerName&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;;<br/>
<br/>
((VarName)). does work as a criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39; into B1<br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Date&#39; into B2<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1.B2) would ideally be expanded to &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39;.&#39;Date&#39; and function properly.<br/>
<br/>
It would be acceptable to <br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39;.&#39;Date&#39; into B1 and then<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1) and have the string evaluated as a function.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This may require a better way to &quot;escape&quot; the single quote marks required for the strings.

<br/>
&quot;Spacemouse. Perspective projection does work slightly better than ortho, but flat views are then almost unusable for accurate work – using Numpad shortcuts to i.e. quickly rotate components in a side view. Fusion 360 has a good halfway house – ‘Perspective with Ortho Faces’. This means that any orbit will present as perspective, but selecting a flat view switches to ortho projection for accurate work. Any movement back to a 3D view then switches back to perspective.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So a perspective view where the geometry and objects within the view are orthogonal (Sounds pretty strange to me as a life long Vectorworks user but why not).<br/>

We think the layer settings in Nomad should override the layer settings from the Vectorworks file.

<br/>
When you pick a wall style that is story bound, and you use it in a file that has no (or not the right) story levels, you get this result:<br/>
 * Red alert message in the bottom right.<br/>
 * If active, a beep.<br/>
 * A wall that has no 3D representation in the drawing area.<br/>
<br/>
Novice users very often pick a wall based on what it looks like. As a consequence, they run into the problem above.<br/>
<br/>
Our tech support team spends too much time explaining the system to these users. For prospects, it is even worse: they try to draw BIM with an eval version, pick the wrong wall style for the template, and give up. &quot;Vectorworks is too complicated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This also happens with other objects that have the option to let their 3D height be defined by levels (like slabs, roofs, structural members, ...)<br/>
<br/>
*Solution:*<br/>
<br/>
A wall offers two options to define its height:<br/>
 * Story bound.<br/>
 * Design layer bound. <br/>
<br/>
You have to pick either one, or the other.<br/>
<br/>
The problem above could be alleviated by implementing a fall back option.<br/>
 * The user can define both a story bound and a design layer bound settings.<br/>
 * When the object style is used, Vectorworks checks if the conditions are met for the story bound setting:<br/>
 ** Does a story exist?<br/>
 ** If yes, does the level exist?<br/>
 * If yes, then the story bound settings are used.<br/>
 * If no, then the Design layer settings are used.<br/>
<br/>
*Urgency*<br/>
<br/>
For Design Express, this has a medium urgency. Our BIM object styles have to be doubled to cater for templates with, and templates without stories and levels.<br/>
<br/>
Combined with different building classifications in different countries, it creates a list of wall styles that is too long for the customer to be comfortable. It adds to the feeling that &quot;Vectorworks is too complicated.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Unlike most other defaults that can be stored in any file at the correct location in the Defaults folder in the User, Workgroup, or Application folder, it appears that ONLY this one specific file is read and only read when VW launches.<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested the Application folder, but I have not been able to make a file with a different name in the User folder or ANY file in the Workgroup folder work as a storage location for Marionette Commands.<br/>
<br/>
I have also not been able to update the list of Marionette except for creating a new Marionette Menu Command, restarting VW, or editing the workspace.<br/>
<br/>
When Marionette Menu commands are removed from the Marionette Command Library.vwx file, they remain in the menu until one of the methods above to reload the commands is executed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Please update the Marionette Menu Commands so that they can be stored in any file stored in the correct location in Defaults in Users, Workgroup or Applications and add a way to force VW to &quot;read&quot; the available commands to populate the menu without restarting VW. Adding this functionality to the Refresh Libraries function in the Resource Manger seems like a reasonable way to do this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This will make the use of Marionette Menu Commands in larger firms using Workgroup folders much easier.

                                            <td class="description">      Recently prompted by a customer’s technical support/training request, I’ve taken up an issue regarding the graphic representation of the sill and head conditions at window insertions with splayed wall profiles. In top/plan view, there are lines that would seem to indicate the face of walls at the head above and sill below (such as at a cased opening). These are classed by default as Ceiling-Main (so, head condition), but with that class off, one can get similar lines by going into the OIP with the Window In Wall selected, and under Visualization, check &quot;Draw wall lines.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But this is the issue: In either case, when the wall-closure-at-inserts profile is set to splay or round, these lines break, such that a gap appears adjacent to the length of the splayed or rounded profile. However, while I initially assumed this could be a bug belonging to the wall-closure-at-inserts feature, I now suspect this could be an enhancement because the lines in question belong to the 2D components of the plug-in object. In fact, I can &quot;solve&quot; the matter by editing the 2D components of the plug-in object and extend the lines to close the gaps. <br/>
<br/>
The caveat, of course, is that by editing the plug-in object, it is converted &quot;to a user-provided component that will no longer be updated by the plug-in object&quot; (according to the popup dialog). On a project, I suppose one could edit the plug-in object style to have the changes extend throughout, but that also assumes one would know that wherever a particularly window (for example) was inserted, you would also have the same wall-closure-at-inserts profile settings applied. <br/>
<br/>
In sum, I think the current workflow would be: to maintain active components, don&#39;t edit 2D components to suit graphic preferences until the design is fixed (that is, no more changes are expected). An enhancement would be that the gaps and other similar graphical glitches would be avoided by, at the very least, being able to constrain 2D component wall lines at wall-closure-at-inserts profiles.

It should be the other way around. The wall lines are +always+ needed on top of the 2D representation of the symbol.

<br/>
It would be awesome if Drawing Label auto-positioning could be determined in a more custom way. I always want the Y position to be a certain distance from the bottom of the viewport geometry&#39;s bounding box, so I always have to move and adjust the label from its default placement. The default seems to be around 1/2&quot; below the geometry, but I typically want 5/8&quot; or 3/4&quot; below.<br/>
<br/>
And for the X position, I want the default placement for my labels to align all the way to the lefthand side of the bounding box of the viewport geometry, and for the label&#39;s control point to automatically extend to the righthand side of bounding box. Attaching an example of how my layouts typically look once I&#39;ve adjust the label placement.<br/>
<br/>
One reason why it&#39;s particularly annoying to do this manually is all the extra clicking into and out of Annotations that&#39;s involved, especially when I&#39;m creating about 150 viewports / week.<br/>
<br/>
If these defaults could be user-adjusted so that it gets me a few steps closer automatically, it would really streamline things.

<br/>
However, these commands seem to default to whatever location was chosen the last time the command was used, which is often some other unrelated project folder. On more than one occasion, I&#39;ve hastily saved into this erroneous location by accident, which later lead to some confusion.<br/>

It would be great if the Save As windows were to default to the current drawing location, which would simplify things and remove possibilities for errors.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That being said, one scenario where this idea is invalid is if you&#39;re in a new/unsaved file... then it makes sense for these commands to use whatever the last location was, as is currently the case.

                Add Filtering to the Resource Manager
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Many users find &quot;clutter&quot; from portions of the software they would like to remove from their system, ([VE-102057) luckily much of this content exists on the cloud, so storage footprint is limited, unfortunately it still occupies large areas of the resource manger when performing a search.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My proposal is to implement a filter system in such a manner that users are able to hide entire categories of resources which they wish to &quot;remove&quot; from the resource manager.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This could potentially be accomplished in part using our existing tag system, though it may require reserved/special tags for this purpose? It would also be helpful to provide tagging at the folder level as this would allow simple exclusion of entire folders.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The main categories I can imagine users filtering are:<br/>
 * Units<br/>
 * Imperial<br/>
 * Metric<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Discipline or Software application<br/>
 * Architect<br/>
 * Landmark<br/>
 * Spotlight<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Hidden files (things like &quot;zNested&quot; or other files could be hidden with a tags as well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To provide a consistent interface, check boxes (rather than the pull down) could also be available for<br/>
 * Resource type<br/>
 * Gradients<br/>
 * Hatches<br/>
 * Images<br/>
 * Line Types<br/>
 * Materials<br/>
 * Record Formats<br/>
 * Renderworks Backgrounds<br/>
 * Renderworks Textures<br/>
 * Roof Styles<br/>
 * Scripts<br/>
 * Sketch Styles<br/>
 * Slab Styles<br/>
 * Symbols/Plug-in Objects<br/>
 * Text Styles<br/>
 * Tiles<br/>
 * Wall Styles<br/>
 * Worksheets<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * The Resource type filter would allow a user additional flexibility to include multiple resources in a single search.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
 * These filter setting should be persistent across an install for continuity<br/>
 * Check boxes should be positive, meaning that if a box is not checked filtering will not occur.<br/>
 * The check boxes should be exposed (easily accessible) in a bar or similar along top or side to allow easy iteration of a search, rather than hidden inside a button.

In certain cases that are very typical for set designers and exhibition stand designers it is important to get a correct mapping of textures on surfaces. In Vectorworks 2021 that was a dream. In 2022 it became a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 they could just choose the texture mapped as perimeter. A 2 seconds action.<br/>
<br/>
Now they have to adopt the texture to each nurbs component of the object using the texture tool. After that they have to adjust the mapping by entering the X-value in a field to position the partial texture. This is a multi-minute trial and error process.

It would be great if there is an option to change / override class and layer visibility of a DLVP reference in a normal viewport.<br/>
<br/>

For example. I&#39;m currently working on a project where we have the full AV setup in a viewport reference.<br/>

The only workaround now is duplicating the viewport reference.<br/>

<br/>
Users should be able to convert Multiple Extrudes to Generic Solids. This would make it consist with other 3D object types, plus provide a way to troubleshoot an object when it&#39;s misbehaving.<br/>
<br/>
For example, at the moment I&#39;m trying to export a 3D model to DWG, but the Multiple Extrude objects aren&#39;t behaving properly. I thought it&#39;d be an easy fix to just convert them to Generic Solids before exporting again, but Vectorworks won&#39;t let me.<br/>
<br/>
As a workaround, I did discover that if I convert each Multiple Extrude to a Mesh first, then I could convert each Mesh to Generic Solids. But this workaround would not be obvious to most users.<br/>

Every case I know, users wants to use page Number to identify the page if they have more than one page on a sheet layer. Also at the end, they want to number ist with page 1 of 10. So the Worker on the site know, how many drawings he need to have the complete drawings. So stacking order seems to be a workaround to number the title blocks because there is no feature to identify the page the title block is lying on top of and also there is not total number of pages.<br/>
<br/>
So the design of the feature either way is away from what we think users wants to do with the page number. Users want a representation of the number in the print dialog. Print page 4 of 25 as Example. <br/>
<br/>
Beside that I think there is a bug. The Number include pages on other sheet layers. I am not sure if this is also the wanted feature-design. In my opinion, the number should start at 1 on every sheet layer. Do I maybe understand something wrong about this feature?<br/>

<br/>
It would be great to have a default &quot;Vectorworks&quot; classification system for all IFC-Entities. At the moment the user experience is, that Vectorworks doesn&#39;t have a classification system. The reason for this experience is, that you have to set up manually the classification for each element in the Data Manager. And you have to know the rules which field are absolutely necessary and which are optionally.<br/>

Cable tools have an option to automatically add a data tag at the beginning point of each cable. When doing so, cables originating from the same distribution device all have the same origination point. Therefore, all the data tags are piled atop each other. The user has two options. One, dragging each data tag to another location one at a time. They then need to perform some form of formatting or distribution and alignment adjustments. 2. Using the align/distribution command. This, however, requires several steps. The first is to move one of the data tags off the pile to an estimated distance that will allow the distribution command to fit all the rest in a line. This falls short as all the data tags are distributed in seemingly random order. The distribution command does not currently have a method of sorting the distributed items.<br/>
 <br/>
Solutions could include:<br/>
1. An automatic offset for data tags when being placed. For plug-in objects that place a single item at a time and then attach their specified data tag, the plug-in object would need to consider data tag placement.<br/>
The automated offset would need to measure the bounding boxes of the data tags to avoid collisions.<br/>
2. Adding a sorting function to the align/distribution tool would allow the user to choose which data field the sort will be based upon. In the cable tools example, this would likely be the ID field.

Problem is, when I discover a locked object that I want to move out of the way, it takes additional time to figure out where it is. <br/>
<br/>
In order to unlock it, I need to activate the layer. figuring out which layer that is can be daunting; the &quot;locked&quot; OIP means both layer and class designation are dimmed. Like, *really* dimmed.<br/>
<br/>
This may have been discussed before, but IMO if an object is declared &quot;locked&quot; in the OIP, I see and recognize that. but if i want to be able to access it, it would be a major assist if the layer and class text were _not_ dimmed, so i could figure out how to get to the layer/class faster, and be able to unlock it.

Currently if you use Brick&amp;Mortar as Compound Material in Wall Components, there is no way to display any properties of that Material alongside quantities, because in a worksheet quantities are reported of Compound Material whereas properties are reported of Simple Materials. <br/>
<br/>
Compound Material properties should be either calculated automatically from a formula based on constituent Simple Materials (ie. cost can be extrapolated from individual Simple Material costs) or entered manually (RF concrete will have strength of its own as tested after setting) or it should be able to show multiple results based on constituent Simple Materials (Manufacturer, Product Source etc)<br/>
<br/>
I was recently interacting with an increasing number of customers using Embodied Carbon Calculator and everyone is confused with how Compound Materials work. Currently they need to enter CM name to obtain quantities AND SM name to get properties. All of them ask why would I use CMs then and can I use just SMs. That is a conversation I&#39;d like to avoid ideally and the reason why VECC is set up in that way, but the solution should be Compound Material Properties, not to stop using Compound Materials.<br/>

However, If I want to reference a view, not a section view, the link is not automatically created. So, I might have a plan own one sheet and an elevation on another. I use a Reference Marker object to say &quot;Hey, go look here!&quot; Then I gets a sad, &#39;cause no link. I can manually create the link, but I have a computer???<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see why this shouldn&#39;t be automatically, but perhaps it is a switch in the OIP. Possibly an option to create a link NOT the link indicated. So, a reference marker that reads drawing A on Sheet 4, might actually like to drawing C on sheet 72. Although I can&#39;t see why.

                Smart-Cursor Improvements
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      The snapping in VW is good, but could be improved to reach the next level. Especially users that worked with other CADs are used to other snap features and are looking for similar functionality in our Smart-Cursor. If the snap in Vectorworks would be improved by the functionality that the users like a lot in other CADs, it would make it easier to switch to Vectorworks. For that we collected several wishes.<br/>
 * *Short key to keep the current angle*. The Shift key doesn&#39;t keep the angles. It jumps to the next possible angle. Especially users that come from AutoCAD are looking for another option to keep and LOCK 0°, 90° or other angles without the jump. See also the movie here: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-99151<br/>
 * *Easier access to stacked objects.* Not a lot of users know what the little * next to the cursor means, when they hover over stacked objects. Also very little users know that they can press a short key or use the context command to have a very small dialog with a list of the stacked objects where one or more objects can be chosen. This also requires several steps and clicks. This could be much easier if the stacked objects could be highlighted in a way that small dialog with the list isn&#39;t required anymore. E.g. the object in the foreground is highlighted, the cursor indicates stacked objects (bigger than *), the user can press a short key to highlight the next object in the background, and the next, and the next. This should be possible combined with Shift to select several stacked objects (like it is possible in the current list).<br/>
 * *Allow Objects in Containers (PIO, Symbols) to be unsnappable.* This would help when setting the Dimensions. In the case of windows, you only want to snap to the wall hole and not to the window sill. Also the frame isn&#39;t desired in this case. They should be only snappable when editing the Symbol/ PIO Geometry.<br/>
 * The same applies to Marionette. If you want to connect Nodes, only the Input should be snappable. See report for more details: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-99835)<br/>
 * *Jump to next Mastersnap.* Users from AutoCAD like the feature to press a button when they are close to a certain master snap point and the curser will jump to that point.<br/>
 * *Snap to Tiles.* In some situations, it would be great to snap to geometry of Tiles e.g. when you create a specific plan for tiles of a bathroom and you need to put dimensions on the tiles. The possibility to snap to tiles isn&#39;t needed for every Object with Tiles and it could be also a performance issue too. A good solution could be to have a checkbox in the OIP like PDF pages have.<br/>
 * Snap should work on the *Clip Cube Surface*. See report for more details: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-98097<br/>
 * VW should show a message if *Snap to Grid is enabled AND Show Grid is off*. The message should show the consequences and could offer the possibility to enable Show Grid. Especially if the user doesn&#39;t see the grid (Show Grid off), it is a source of errors for inexperienced users. We see that often in support and trainings that users enable Snap to Grid because they aren&#39;t aware of the consequences.<br/>
 * *Snap marker outside the snap zone.* Currently, snap marker often covers the area where the snapping happens. E.g. if two Mastersnaps are close to each other, the snapped one needs to be visible. But it is covered from a marker, that has the purpose to help. _See screenshot in JIRA._<br/>
 * *Double-click suspend snapping shortcut* should be disabled during writing: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-189888<br/>
 * *Snap to intersection of 3D objects:* https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-103422<br/>
 * *Snap to selection.* If there are a lot of objects in the drawing, it would be great if there would be an option to limit the snap to the selected objects only.

Would like to offer a workflow whereby the user does not overwrite their power circuit name and number with subsequent data cables. At the moment, the cable tool does not differentiate between the types of cables being drawn.<br/>
<br/>
If we can offer any of the following, it would be helpful until data cables are implemented.<br/>
1. A checkbox that, when checked, inserts the circuit name and circuit number into the appropriate field. When unchecked, the information will not be entered and therefore not overwrite any existing data.<br/>
2. A checkbox or additional setting in the automated numbering tool allows the user to insert or not insert the circuit name and number information.<br/>
3. A limit of some sort that restricts the placing of circuit names and circuit numbers to that of jumper cables.

Probably it would make sense to start a discussion about these steel tools and the structural member. Do we need both or can the new style based Structural Member overtake the complete functionality and shapes of the steel tools?<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      When using the summarize option of the Worksheet, we often find cells with the &quot;—&quot; value, because for Vectorworks, the corresponding cells have different values.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that this difference is sometimes very low. Two dimensions should be considered as identical if their displayed value are equal. Otherwise, users do not understand why the &quot;—&quot; is displayed instead of the value.<br/>
<br/>
In this example the have a Railing object with 4 posts.<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_1.png!<br/>
<br/>
We can see that the posts Height is &quot;—&quot;. But when we disable the summarize option :<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_02.png!<br/>
<br/>
Looking at this, all users will think that all posts have the same height and so won&#39;t understand why the summarize option is not working.<br/>
<br/>
If we switch to millimeter units and ask for more precision in the worksheet, the we can see that one post is 20 micrometers longer than the others:<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_03.png!<br/>
<br/>
They all have the same height, but because the user has put a very slight difference between &quot;Height Pt 1 and &quot;Height Pt 2&quot;, one post is *20 micrometer* longer than the others. This is far below the precision of the unit settings.<br/>
<br/>
*With this logic, the user should produce a quote for the railing with 3 posts + one 20 micrometer longer? Of course not.*<br/>
<br/>
So either the Worksheet should use units settings *to apply precision of the summarize comparison of values*, or at least, give to the user the possibility to choose a precision with the summarize option. In the latter, the default value should be the one matching the unit settings of the document.

As you soon as you select a second Fillet object, the OIP says &quot;2 CSG Solids&quot; and all OIP parameters disappear despite them having common parameters.<br/>

We need to be able to select more than one Fillet object and be able to change their radii in the OIP. Currently you have to select and change one at at time which is incredibly cumbersome.<br/>

This same improvement likely also applies to other CSG objects, such as the Thickness parameter for multiple Shell objects.

I propose this be accomplished by using one of the existing cells in the data table, or adding a cell that would directly reference a single nozzle performance data set. Using a direct reference, rather than the model would greatly reduce complexity, redundant data, errors and time consuming changes within the performance catalog.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the complexity comes from using the Manufacturers model names to lookup performance data. for example. A manufacturer may offer:<br/>
 # 4 different heights (all different model numbers) X<br/>
 # 2 different materials X<br/>
 # Check valve or not X<br/>
 # Non potable (Purple Cap) X<br/>
 # etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had models with 20+ models and 34 nozzles resulting in 680 model numbers that should only have 34 performance tables (or 68 with pressure regulation) that end up with 5x or more of that number. Each nozzle should have a single performance table - 2 if there is a pressure regulated version.<br/>
<br/>
The Hunter I-20 has 24 models that reference the 2.0 Nozzle performance, 10 of these use an alternate &quot;pressure regulated&quot; chart. These two tables currently have 11 entries in the Outlet Rotor Performance catalog that use a variety of wildcard characters in a effort to reduce redundancy. Each data set contains ±25 pieces of data that define the nozzle performance - the proposed change would eliminate the redundancy from 255 data points to 50, while also making it much simpler to insure the reference calls the appropriate performance data. Each of the 24 entries would simply receive a reference either the standard &quot;I-20 2.0&quot; or &quot;I-20 2.0PR&quot; data set.<br/>
<br/>
For example the Outlet Rotors catalog could add a column titled &quot;Nozzle Performance Table&quot;to enter these values.

It is understood objects inside Sheet Layer Viewports are positioned relative to the Internal Origin - which is fine for general drafting as it allows the User Origin to be moved freely (without the observed affect above).

For PIO&#39;s you can map a Vectorworks Record Format with the Data Manager. Every existing and new object has the record format attached.<br/>
For example for ifcDoor this is not possible in the Data Manager. You can do it in the OIP or Marionette (our current way). For all customers which work with Import IFC this would be very helpful and a time saver.<br/>

It would be nice to allow users to have the option to keep this preprocessor on forward movement, maybe a list of the affected nodes (check to see if the code inside has changed between versions?) could be displayed and users can choose which node types to update or leave with old code?

Unfortunately, this is often not possible, because there are several record fields of the Space formatted as Text or Static Text instead of numeric types.<br/>
<br/>
With VW2023 we replaced Space Labels with Data Tags. Now, the Field Types of the Space Record are even more exhibited as before in Reports, Data Manager or Scripts.<br/>
<br/>
It now becomes very apparent that the Field Types of the Space record formats are a bit of a mess. We should go through it and check where the current Field Types make sense or where they could be changed to numeric values (Area, Coord Disp, Real etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Often there are duplicated values. One formatted as Text and the other as Number. This should be avoided and only the Number should be provided to the user.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples:<br/>
 {color:#ff0000}{{Gross Area}} {color}-&gt; defined as _+Static Text,+_ redundant, duplicated value of _{{{color:#ff0000}Gross Area{color} {color:#ff0000}Number{color}}}_<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}{{Gross Elevation Bottom Bound}}{color} -&gt; defined as _+Text+,_ should be defined as +_Coord Disp_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}{{Gross Elevation Top Bound}}{color}<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Coord Disp_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}Lamps (ct){color} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Real_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}Numbers of occupants{color} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Real_+ <br/>
<br/>
{{{color:#ff0000}Volume{color}}} -&gt; defined as _+Text+,_ redundant, duplicated value of {{{color:#ff0000}Net Volume Number{color}}}<br/>
<br/>
{{{color:#ff0000}Glazing Area Ratio (%){color}}} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as _+Real (Percentage)+_<br/>
<br/>
There are many more...<br/>
<br/>
In addition some numberic values are just defined as simple +_Real_+ instead of +_Coord Disp_+ (for lengths), _+Area+_, Volume, _+Real (Percentage)+_ etc. If this would be defined, they could be displayed with the correct unit. This would make the current text definded numbers  including a unit redundant.<br/>

<br/>
A workaround is to duplicate sheets A1 -A7 with special names (A1.1...A7.1) and reduce the page size for those special sheets. Then you can use the publish command with only those special sheets to get a single multi-page PDF in 12x18 for example. This too is very much effort.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to be able to produce a reduced size PDF multi-page document with the Publish command, ON THE FLY.<br/>
- not duplicating and editing sheets for reduced size<br/>
- not having to manually collate individual PDFs<br/>
<br/>
AND, of note, the reduced page size PDFs currently exported by VW are the same file size as the full-size PDFs. We would hope the reduced PDFs would be smaller file size(s)

<br/>
It would be great if you could consider one or more of the following solutions:<br/>
 * Data Visualisation should treat the records the same if the records have the same name and same fields (References and master document)<br/>

It would be great to have own attributes for objects far away beyond the cut plane of section viewports. Requirements:<br/>
 * Value &quot;Finite&quot; for the first attributes (from cut plane to the value finite)<br/>
 * Attributes for all objects further away than the value &quot;Finite&quot;<br/>

With the help of a some people smarter than me, I finally realized what the OIP Rotation field is reporting: _*screen rotation* (not actual rotation)._<br/>
<br/>
I never would have figured that out on my own because Screen X, Screen Y, and Screen Z are added fields with blue font. For starters, the UI is inconsistent with font color. Screen data should all be blue. Unrotated actual data should always be black.

<br/>
I have a Braceworks user in Melbourne who uses 4 different structural engineers. All use an engineering program called ‘[Space Gass|https://www.spacegass.com/index.htm]’ (no one uses SCIA here). He is questioning the value of Braceworks because the export format that includes all the Braceworks intelligence is unable to be [imported into Space Gass|https://www.spacegass.com/manual/Getting_Started/Input_methods.htm] as far as we can tell.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The request is that other export formats be developed for the export of the Braceworks structure into civil engineering programs especially this one. This is one of the main selling points of Braceworks after all - saving time so the structural engineers don’t have to re-input everything, or is there another way? Does IFC contain Braceworks data like loads?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Peter.

<br/>
At the moment the name of a viewport is very present in Vectorworks (Navigation palette, Organisation dialog, etc.). In comparison, for example, the drawing number and the drawing title of a &quot;normal&quot; Viewport are much less important.<br/>
<br/>
For Section Viewports the drawing number is more important because to the section line. <br/>
<br/>
What are the requirements / ideas from my work with current BIM-projects:<br/>
 * The Vectorworks name of viewports should be less important. The drawing title of a viewport should used for all organization jobs. The drawing label for example also use the drawing title and/or the drawing number.<br/>
 * Formula/Auto-Name for the Drawing Title. For example: &quot;SheetName_ScaleVP_Counter&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Attached a file with some scripts which we use to rename viewports for a better organisation of the project.<br/>

For angles dimension you would have to resort to trigonometry. These formulas are too complicated to be easily done in a worksheet cell.<br/>
<br/>
The attached script takes the Dimension Text and converts it to a number, but gets complicated due to Units and the dash included in Feet &amp; Inches dimensions. This is not a good way to accomplish the task.<br/>

Actually it would be good to have a function that returns the actual length of any linear object (lines and probably others) rather than the X/Y values available with Width/Height.<br/>

<br/>
 A wrapping function of some type is needed. That should include having the header repeat with each element and/or having a wider header.<br/>
<br/>
I adobe Illustrator and InDesign, when text is inserted it creates a container. The container can be made wider, longer, or shorter. When the text (given font and size, etc) no longer fits in the container, there is a graphic indicator in the lower right of the container. Clicking that indicator changes the cursor to the insertion cursor and the overflow text can be inserted elsewhere.<br/>

In cases, where certain conditions can mean different initial calculations take different routes, but later on are handled the same, because the results are used as part of a bigger network, you have to *duplicate everything* for every route.<br/>

Our wish is for a way to merge such routes to avoid the duplication issue.<br/>

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      There are essentially two groups within our customers: those who create Customized Tools (Marionette Creators) and those who use them (Marionette Users). With the data vector of „tool activation“ we are getting a good picture of the usage patterns of the former group, but we have no clue about the latter.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of statistics the two can be easily separated because Marionette Users mainly run the Customized Tools, while Marionette Creators do both (activate the Marionette Tool to create, and also run the Networks/Nodes/Menu Commands).<br/>
<br/>
There are different ways we can go about this. We could <br/>
a)<br/>
simply log the usage of „Run Marionette Script“ (context menu, OIP and menu commands).<br/>
<br/>
Or we could do that and go one/two steps further:<br/>
b)<br/>
Similar to how Usage Reporting gives us a view on how often each tool in Vectorworks is used by our customers, it would be beneficial to know which Marionette Nodes are used. Having this information we can investigate the causes and improve access to those Nodes maybe nobody knows about. I often come across ideas of Marionette Creators to make new Nodes, they think don’t exist, yet.<br/>
<br/>
and (optionally) c)<br/>
Vectorworks could hash the code of every Marionette network - without In-port values or comments - and send the hashes with the usage report. That would allow us to see how often/wide-spread for example Customization Tools/Nodes/Networks uploaded to the Marionette Gallery are being used.<br/>
<br/>
The sooner those vectors are included, the sooner we have a more complete picture of the Marionette universe.

Currently, picking a tool and then changing the tool&#39;s mode requires a lot of fidgeting and it is actually not very easy to change modes of a tool because modes live in a separate quadrant. Also, changing of the tool itself is made more difficult than needs to be because after invoking the smart options, the user must mouse over to the top left (which is a relatively small hover target) to (re)open the tool palette.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my suggestion is two-fold:<br/>
# remember the last used quadrant<br/>
# Include modes in the tool quadrant (rough mockup is provided)<br/>
<br/>
Remembering the last used quadrant could be restricted to spacebar-use as it would probably get in the way if it always opened fully as soon as the SOD auto-appears.

<br/>
We spend a lot of time preparing template for projects with pre-defined user origins and the last thing we want is for Vectorworks &#39;recommended&#39; settings to intervene.<br/>

The same goes for the subsequent message asking if we want to do what Vectorworks recommends! Often causes problems when the user fails to read that message and assumes it&#39;s asking if they want to do what they have spent time setting up, only to find out it&#39;s doing what Vectorworks recommends.

The calculation is always done with the component thickness defined in the slab settings. But if the component hasn&#39;t a continuous thickness because of a drainage, the calculation for the R-Value needs to be done with the average thickness of the component.<br/>

In the attachement you&#39;ll find an example for a simple conic Slab. Of course, if more drains are added on different locations with different heights, the calculation gets more complex.

The height in this example should be 2100, for instance, but I have to make it 2090 to allow for the 10 mm shim gap. If the shim gap gets changed, to say 12 mm, we also need to remember to change this setting to 2088. Suffice say this has caused us a few headaches in the past.

It really transforms how one works and interacts with their drawing/model. It&#39;s very useful to go from a single view of, say, a plan, to a multiple view showing the plan, a front elevation and custom or preset 3D view.<br/>
<br/>
However, to actually make this UI and view change complete, currently one must activate one saved view, then turn on MVP, then click activate each individual pane and activate a saved view for each of those panes. This requires many clicks and looking across the UI to complete, unfortunately taking the designer out of their design flow.<br/>
<br/>
For your consideration...<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if Saved Views could remember the multiple view panes state (enabled/disables) as well as (for the enabled state) how many panes are open and what each one&#39;s respective saved view options are. This way, if a saved view was created with MVP on and each pane set to the desired view, the designer could simply activate that saved view to quickly keep working in their design while seeing the already-decided views they need of the design.<br/>
<br/>
There are obvious benefits for using Saved Views for presentation purposes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

Currently, our users, when having a long, long worksheet, are unable to clearly place these on Sheet Layers without using multiple viewport tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, user places a long and tall worksheet on a design layer, say 1:1 scale, then create a viewport on a Sheet. create a crop (rectangle), then duplicate the viewport, move to the side, adjust the crop to only showing the header. Then again duplicate that viewport, adjust the crop to the rest of the worksheet, move below the previous viewport and rinse and repeat.  (see attachment)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to propose we match or improve what Revit is already doing to their worksheets.<br/>

More interior designers are downloading our software and reaching out for private demos. There is a lot of clarification on how much they can get done in a single software. However, some of these prospects, specially the ones that are already sold on the idea of cool drawings and rendering, ask questions about creating reports, itemizing every aspect of a project. And they pointed out we are falling short in comparison to what Excel provides and what even our competition can do with spreadsheets.  <br/>
<br/>
The first and obvious deficiency, is not being able to paste an image into a cell.  yes we have the formula =image, but that forces the user to model a detailed object in order to make it show in a report. This is not good enough. A realistic photo would avoid human confusion.  The situation I was explained, goes like this: &quot;When a truck full of office furniture and other smaller items is waiting outside the space, the guys do not look for ID numbers on a spreadsheet, they look for a matching photo of the piece and then grab them and bring them in place.  Visuals here are very important. <br/>
<br/>
Please see attachment so you can get a better idea of where we want to be if we want to persist on reaching out for these designers. <br/>

If we want to draw with as high efficiency in Vectorworks as in Sketchup when it comes to modeling via push pull, then there will certainly have to be an option to give an extrusion a fill color.<br/>
<br/>
For now, if you model a building with the push-pul tools, a plan in top view is completely obscure because all objects at whatever height they are just run through each other. See figure 1 of a simple model via push pull in 3d. looks good, but if we put it in a 2D it&#39;s totally unreadable. So please fill color possible with extrusions.<br/>

<br/>
Partly in response to this we&#39;ve started modelling cavity barriers. This makes them a more prominent part of the design process and has helped me to put earlier thought into their arrangement. Instead of applying them as 2D objects latter in the process. It also provides the possibility of displaying them in 3D, in a 3D view or even on an elevation, with the outer wall components turned off.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is I&#39;ve only been adding horizontal cavity barriers to the model, using the Slab object. At the moment I&#39;m still relying on 2D for vertical cavity barriers. Because there&#39;s no suitable tool that comes to my mind that can conveniently model vertical cavity barriers and insert them into walls. And the Slab object is not particularly ideal for the horizontal barriers either, as it would be useful to be able to insert these into walls also.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d like a tool designed for this purpose.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Currently the Power planning palettes device graph doesn&#39;t really display the circuit/phase loading very well for distributors that do not use some form of 3-phase connector (CEE, PowerLock, Camlock, etc...) for the distributors input connector.<br/>
<br/>
The device graph displays the load on the first 3 pins of the input connector of each device, for all 3-phase connectors this works very well since pins 1 thru 3 are always the live phases of the connector, but for multi-core (socapex, harting, etc...) connectors this doesn&#39;t work very well since they typically have anything from 4 live pins (circuits) to 8 live pins and wildly different pin orders depending on the wiring standard used.<br/>
<br/>
This means that socapex and harting breakouts/plugboxes do not display their phase or circuit loading in a understandable manor for our users since they all have more live phases/circuits and often have pin layouts where the live pins are not sequential inside the connector,<br/>
<br/>
for example<br/>
 * Harting 6 channel German wiring goes Pin 1 thru 6 = L1 thru 6,<br/>
 * Harting 6 channel Benelux/Netherlands goes Pin1=L1, pin2 = N1, pin3 = L2, etc...<br/>
<br/>
The same issues are common with Socapex connectors. <br/>
 for example<br/>
 * US 208v 6 channel socapex Pin1=L1a, Pin2=L1b, Pin3=L2a, etc...<br/>
 * US 120v 6 channel socapex Pin1=L1, Pin2=N1, Pin3=L2, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Similar issues apply to anything that uses a single or 2 phase connector, except they will display the unused pins or pin loading, potentially confusing the user<br/>
<br/>
Instead of displaying the load on the first 3 pins, it would be better to display the load on all  live pins of the input connector of each distributor object. <br/>
 this would also improve how the electrical load for consumer objects is displayed since they typically use single or 2 phase connectors as it would only display the pins that the consumer applies electrical load on.

                                            <td class="description">      *Problems to solve:* the text of the VECC (Vectorworks Embodied Carbon Calculator) User Guide is found on a PDF file available online (see last paragraph under *_Embodied Carbon Calculator_* here: [https://bit.ly/3y4AAas)] and on UI strings for Vectorworks 2022 SP4 (filename: VECC.vwx). While the VECC.vwx file contains the VECC worksheet, it is unsuitable to contain the user guide and presents challenges to the user, who has to click on each of the 14 sheets to access the contents before the user can utilize the worksheet as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Found in both the PDF VECC User Guide and the VECC.vwx file are instructions to open the VECC calculator this way: in Vectorworks, go to *Tools &gt; Reports &gt; Create Report &gt; Preformatted Report &gt; Embodied Carbon Calculator*. The calculator can also be copied from the VECC.vwx file (sheet #12) and pasted into any other Vectorworks file. These instructions are only visible to the user only after the user opens the VECC.vwx file and reads down to sheet #12 or if the user opens the PDF User Guide by searching the specific webpage in the Online Help System. This is unnecessarily complicated and distracting to the user.<br/>
<br/>
The online PDF file for the VECC User Guide has been created with Vectorworks and exported by it. Given the nature of a user guide, Vectorworks is not a suitable DTP (desktop publishing) tool to create user guides. The same user guide exists as UI strings, a wholly unsuitable medium to organize a modern user guide, which is not nor should not be a readme file.<br/>
<br/>
The VECC User Guide contains some inaccuracies that make very difficult for the user to perform certain actions. For instance, under Transport Stage [A4] (sheet #6 in the VECC.vwx file), the sequence of commands, *Material &gt; Material Construction &gt; Product Source* field, is incorrect, compared to the accompanying screenshot of the Edit Material dialog box to the left (see below for context). It should read instead something along the lines of “The *Product Source* field, found in the *Construction* tab of the *Edit Material* dialog box, should also be populated by following the options detailed below.” <br/>
<br/>
!image-2022-06-29-10-56-02-143.png!<br/>
<br/>
*Recommendations:* 1) Modify the VECC.vwx file to _*only*_ contain the VECC worksheet. The VECC user guide instructions should be easily accessible via the online Help as with any other Vectorworks features and the user should not have to follow a separate procedure. <br/>
<br/>
2) Simplify the creation and/or customization of the VECC worksheet by guiding the user to either follow the commands (*Tools &gt; Reports &gt; Create Report &gt; Preformatted Report &gt; Embodied Carbon Calculator*) in Vectorworks or copy and paste it from the VECC.vwx file (which would only consist of the VECC worksheet). <br/>
<br/>
3) Reorganize the VECC User Guide to resolve inaccuracies such as the one indicated above (see screenshot for context.) This may involve some rewriting to follow standard documentation of features.<br/>
<br/>
4) Recreate the VECC User Guide in a suitable industry standard DTP tool (InDesign, Frame Maker, RoboHelp, etc.) to make the translation into Vectorworks&#39; supported languages more efficient and improve the user&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
5) Remove the VECC User Guide content strings from the batch of extractable strings for localization, since they duplicate efforts and add unnecessary complexity to our localization tasks.

<br/>
as posted in the 2023 Beta thread T02271_Shaded_Rendering_Improvements.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The attached screen recording demonstrates an issue I keep encountering with the new Shaded mode reflection capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Default Light&quot; which exists when no other lights are in the scene is awfully distracting when seen as a bright reflection in glass surfaces. It honestly looks like Tinkerbell! This has been an issue when showing models to Production Designers and Directors. The effect is particularly odd because this light moves around with the viewer, unlike other stationary Lights that you add to the scene as objects.<br/>
<br/>
Would there be a way to change the coding so it specifically excludes the Default Light reflection from any textures set to Glass Reflectivity?<br/>
<br/>
I know I can turn off reflections completely under Shaded Options, but this new functionality makes other objects look so much better when navigating a model, such as metals. I really love the advancements in Shaded mode in 2023, I just wish it wasn&#39;t so distracting on glass.

<br/>
The more we encourage customers and prospects to use Vectorworks for their freeform modelling however, and the more people come from using SketchUp, the more we get the request to be able to associate dimensions to such objects. SketchUp does associate dims to its massed &quot;objects&quot; so it is quite noticeable when Vectorworks can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Even without the comparison to SketchUp, it is a reasonable expectation for our customers to have that dims that are placed at a point of a 3D form would remain attached to that 3D form as that form is modified.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is simple movie of associated dims in SketchUp, just to show what SU users are used to. Being able to do the same within Vectorworks would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally of course the associated dims would not only be possible on the design layer but also within the viewport annotation space. I do realize that our dimension lines and values would remain on their working plane when added on a design layer. This would likely be the same desire when they are added in the viewport annotation space, though I suspect it may be a bigger challenge to accomplish this (since there really isn&#39;t a working plane there.) Perhaps a solution is that:<br/>
 * Dims added on the Design Layer would be on the working plane<br/>
 * Dims added in the VP annotation space would be on the Flt to the screen (screen plane) and still associated with the 3D object.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this. I would be happy to help test this when the time comes.

 # Activate RW Camera tool<br/>
 # Click once to set insertion point<br/>
 # Click again to set view direction<br/>
 # Move mouse over to OIP and click on &quot;Match Current View&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
Note also that steps 2 and 3 &quot;feel&quot; wrong because you&#39;re inserting a camera in an arbitrary spot just to get the object into the document. Most users don&#39;t realize this process is even possible until someone teaches it to them.<br/>
<br/>
What would be great is to have a separate mode button for the RW Camera tool that automatically inserts a camera that matches the current view when clicked.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about it though, a mode button might be challenging because how would it work when in Top/Plan?<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps instead it could be a new command under the View menu called &quot;Insert Camera at Current View&quot; which would insert a RW camera using the default RW camera settings. The command would only be available when in 3D perspective.<br/>
<br/>
A command would also be great because users could assign a keyboard shortcut to it. I would certainly use this a lot when finding camera views with a Director or Production Designer.<br/>
<br/>
There might also be an opportunity to add a command like this to the Camera palette.

<br/>
Often a project folder will contain multiple &#39;Superseded&#39; folders, as well as &#39;VW Backup&#39; folders.<br/>
<br/>
When selecting the source folder for conversion or archiving it would be very useful if we were given a view of the folders to be converted, and be able to tick and untick which folders we want to convert, similar to how, for example, backup software works.  See attached screenshot from Crashplan.[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_07/1412352928_Screenshot2022-07-13at11_11_30.thumb.png.0a309223e4bf45ac4de766b72a4b9076.png|width=1000!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_07/148299539_Screenshot2022-07-13at11_11_30.png.2ed068950b5ffb90a05f2ffb0378dc6d.png]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So if a project folder is comprised of two sub-folders, rather than Vectorworks trawlling through both folders, we could select one or the other and avoid the unnecessary waste of time while Vectorworks assesses if the folder contains any Vectorworks files or not.<br/>
<br/>
An option to ignore &#39;VW Backup&#39; or Folders containing the word &#39;Superseded&#39;, or other keyword, would also be essential.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.

Was wanting to put in a request, which I think we asked about previously. The window tool is really lacking an option to have an opaque glazed panel in it. We specify these in almost every project we do, and there just isn&#39;t a sensible way of achiving it at the moment. A typical arrangement would be to have a window with an upper clear pane and a lower opaque pane. Do you know if there is anything in the pipe line to make this more achievable?<br/>

I have a case here that already existed in 2018. The problem is that it is not possible to calculate two different cross sections together. The wish would be to be able to do this in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I have attached a test file and the 2018 email to you directly.

This makes outdoor light shows difficult to render with renderworks especially when lasers or Big lights ar used <br/>

There is a need for some users to be able to render light beams thru at least 150m in Renderworks.<br/>

We use a workaround with a worksheet script, but that workaround is pretty slow on larger files. So there might be room for improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Users are used to draw in cm or mm, but they want some results in worksheets in meters. The same is true for square and volume units: while most items are counted in cubic meters, some items are often counted in cubic decimeters.<br/>
<br/>
I think we need the option to choose the units in which the worksheet shows it&#39;s results. Check the screenshots.<br/>

in the current beta-Version of Vectorworks 2023 you can double click a device within the power palette and it jumps right to that device in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if you can have a multiple selection by make use of the Option/shift/alt-key while clicking on a device.<br/>
<br/>
The actual behaviour, that it jumps to the selected device, should remain.<br/>
<br/>

There wishlist items are:<br/>
 * Demo Tool or some form of phasing capability.<br/>
 * Better BIM interoperability - there BIM deliverables have been rejected because there is no phasing workflow in Vectorworks that doesn&#39;t involve classes. The must adhere to NCS Standards and they don&#39;t accommodate -demo, -existing, and -new classes. There needs to be a different way to control phasing.<br/>
 * Improved Section Viewports - they cannot create good drawings from sections so they are forced to draw over everything in their section viewport. They want more control over graphics.<br/>
 * They want less flexibility and clearer understanding of best practices. There are too many conflicting UI elements to know what to use and how.

1) user has a finished project and wants to use all the mappings as a template for new projects<br/>
2) user opens new empty file and opens the saved XML file.<br/>

Here&#39;s the proposal:<br/>
When opening an XML-file in the data manager, Vectorworks checks if there are any orphaned mappings. If there are, then ask the user whether they want to keep them or not.

&quot;I&#39;ve been using your products since the days of MiniCAD and have always preferred it to your competitors because it allows me to approach problems my way instead of how some programmer thinks people should approach design problems (Fusion 360 is a prime example of this). I can&#39;t comment on SolidWorks because it does not run on a Mac... While I love VectorWorks, there are some things it needs to do better (documentation, drawing worm gears, some types of extruding along a path), as well as add some functions.<br/>
<br/>
One set of functions people have been asking for for years relate to *drawing circular arcs tangent to two lines, a circle and a line not tangent to the circle, and 2 circles*. I know that users can write programs for VectorWorks but I&#39;ve never been able to figure out how (poor documentation). Since I don&#39;t know how to program those functions for VectorWorks, I&#39;d be happy to provide the mathematical formula for them as well as the bit more complicated problems of drawing circular arcs tangent to a line and spline, a line and an ellipse, 2 ellipses, and 2 splines.

<br/>
Whenever I want to edit wall peaks, I always hit the minus key which is the keyboard shortcut for the Reshape tool. However in 2023 this is no longer applicable due to the changes of T02297.<br/>
<br/>
For other folks who might also hit the minus key, I wonder if they&#39;ll know what to do now that the Reshape tool no longer has the wall peaks functionality in 2023. Users might not be aware of the fact that a new tool exists (unfortunately it seems many folks don&#39;t read &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; documentation).<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m wondering if whenever the Reshape tool is activated +with a Wall selected+, perhaps a message in the utility bar could suggest using the Edit Wall tool.<br/>

It would be extremely handy to ALSO be able to draw these shapes from their center points +while on the first mode+ by holding down the Option key (or the Windows equivalent).<br/>
<br/>
This would reduce the number of clicks necessary to change between modes all the time (not only the physical clicks, but also the mental interruption in a user&#39;s thought process vs the simple muscle memory of a hotkey). It would also bring Vectorworks more in line with other software that uses the same hotkey approach (take for example drawing a Rectangle or Marquee in Photoshop, which I&#39;ve attached a screen recording example of).<br/>
<br/>
The existing mode bar modes can stay exactly as they are, I am only proposing to additionally add the ability to temporarily &quot;boomerang&quot; to center mode.<br/>

Additionally, as per this post:<br/>

<br/>
the hotkey to draw &quot;from center&quot; should be added to the new third mode of the Door &amp; Window tools in order to draw these objects from center, which I&#39;ve already filed as part of VE-102527.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, a Vectorworks user should expect to always be able to use the same hotkey modifier to do things &quot;by center&quot; across any tools and scenarios where it would be applicable (please see VE-103130 which relates to this as well).<br/>

It would be a great feature for worksheet if they cloud support grouping of lines &amp; rows like in excel. This would increase the usability of huge worksheets in Vectorworks.<br/>
Example:<br/>
You create a worksheet for doors in a building. On the line 3 you list all doors from the first floor. In the line 5 all doors for the second floor and so on. With grouping line 3 you could very easy make the doors from the first floor invisible.<br/>

We can set all sorts of defaults for Callouts, but not Class, and this is an important aspect because the Class can be used to determine the Callout&#39;s visual attributes such as pen color &amp; line thickness.<br/>
<br/>
For example, all of the callouts on my drawings have a 6 mil blue pen, and if I don&#39;t remember to make sure they&#39;re on my class called &quot;2D-Annotations&quot; then they don&#39;t look correct.<br/>
<br/>
Which means every time I insert a callout I need to change its class, or make sure I have the correct Active Class prior to inserting callouts. This slows down the process of annotating.<br/>

<br/>
This works great but doesn&#39;t allow any snapping reference, so objects will end up getting placed at random distances relative to other objects. Architects will generally want their Windows/Doors to be at nice, even distances from other objects so they&#39;ll probably have to go in after-the-fact and fine-tune the placement to match their desired grid.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, the Wall surface would recognize the active snap grid and limit the X/Y placement to those intervals. This works fine in Top/Plan view but not in 3D views.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie and test file (with a 6&quot; snap grid active) show an example. Note that if I draw an object in Top/Plan it adheres to the snap grid, but it ignores the snap grid in 3D.

When going through the update process, this would then allow users to select multiple viewports more logically, grouped by sheets, within the viewports tab. Does this make sense [@jloy|https://vectorworks.slack.com/team/U0CKDESNB]   ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the image attached, see how the top viewport in the list is named 1/1002. It would be much more useful if it was named 1002/1. It would then follow that other viewports assigned to that 1002 sheet would be named 1002/2, 1002/3 etc.  As it is, the current implementation means that finding 1/1002, 2/1002, 3/1003, and 1/1003, 2/1003, 3,1003 is much trickier, because they are distributed throughout the list.

User requirement is to pick a subpart of a parent object, e.g. the Top Rail of the Railing/Fence object and to derive desired quantities for that subpart (e.g. the Length). Presumably, many of these desired quantities will be provided by the new functions(options). The current functionality of the dialog exacts a different workflow which goes like this: The User can filter all functions by parent object. Then he must pick a quantity (e.g. =LENGTH) instead of a subpart and then has to check in the details field or Show Examples Text File, if the selected function is, amongst others, applicable to that subpart he has in mind and if the quantity for this subpart will be calculated in the desired way. For that reason, it would be good if he could filter functions by parent object AND by subpart. <br/>

<br/>
The command Rotate 3D... isn&#39;t very intuitive because it gives no visual feedback to the user.<br/>
 * After pressing OK, the object will be rotated like defined<br/>
 * If the users detects that the values where wrong, they must use cmd+Z and try again with new values...<br/>
 * To get the desired result, this must be repeated several times..<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the Rotate Tool gives visual feedback but the users need to align the current view in 90° to the desired rotation axis, which is also an additional and complicated step.<br/>
<br/>
There are already some VEs in Jira about that topic. Example: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-94901<br/>
<br/>
If you consider to improve how objects can be rotated in 3D, you could also think about having a slider somewhere for the main axis. See attached movie. Although, the movie is capured on a phone with touch screen, the slider would be a great improvement on a desktop computer as well.

*Recommendations:*<br/>
<br/>
1) Rewrite strings containing poly or polys to reflect whether they indicate polygons or polylines;<br/>
<br/>
2) Whether polys or poly refer to a polygon or polyline, spell it out as such to avoid further confusion;<br/>
<br/>
3) Whenever possible, rename plugin filenames accordingly.<br/>

It is not possible to create a 2- threaded winder at the end of a stair. The tool always forces you to keep one extra rise on the top.

Is is not possible to let a stair start with a landing. The tool always force you to have at least 1 thread in front of it.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the most frequently asked questions by customers at support.

We can now draw the stairs at an angle in 2D and 3D in VW2022. But we can&#39;t yet move a control point so that the staircase tapers or slopes.<br/>
<br/>
You specify the width of the step, and this then applies to the entire length of the staircase. It would be nice if we could also set this and move it in 2D/3D.

As Patrick mentioned in VB-187439  it should be possible to do the same for cable objects and the objects connected to their start and end in the new connection view of the palette.<br/>

Being able to select cables and the devices they link together from inside the connection view would provide a far more efficient workflow for editing cables.

Unfortunately all these requests can&#39;t be answered in the same time in the current section viewport system.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore the options are unclear.<br/>
<br/>
A part of the options is found in the Advanced Section Properties.<br/>
<br/>
Another part is found in the 2 Hidden Object Display dialogs and the Object Display dialog. These dialogs offer the option for each class to be shown as: None, Hidden Line, Dashed, Hidden line. It is totally unclear when to use what setting.<br/>
<br/>
The result is that since these options where introduced, we didn&#39;t see 1 user using these options.<br/>

Please provide a simpler workflow with clear settings.

Although it is possible to enter a precise value in the data bar for each push/pull direction,  in order to make this tool truly interactive, then this extra mode is needed - especially for nonplanar faces where it is impossible to snap a face to an object accurately.

<br/>
[https://vectorworks.my.salesforce.com/a1z2M000007Fbci]<br/>
<br/>
+Wish list:+<br/>
<br/>
(the wish list is discussed during the meeting from 1:04:00 onward)<br/>
 * An ability to create repeatable *Unit plans* please.<br/>
 * In the publish dialog dog, *view the sheets by the sheet stacking order* as seen in the organization dialog. <br/>
 * *Consistency* in the software, they UI and between different tools - i.e. there are wall style settings but no roof style settings?<br/>
 * Make data more accessible, easier to use, more consistent throughout the application. <br/>
 * All tools that can show dims should be able to have *units independent from the file’s unit settings*. This would allow users who need to work from one unit system to another to be able to show the needed dim units more easily and without workaround.<br/>
 * A single *stake object that can have an existing and proposed state.*<br/>
 * Direction from Vectorworks on the *best* *way* to do a particular workflow. David recognizes that Vectorworks is flexible and versatile and _can_ get to an end result in many ways, but he wishes that we would state the best practice method for any given workflow.<br/>
 * The ability to *share/export a VWX file including only certain layers*, like one can do when exporting DWGs.<br/>
 * *Snapping and measuring in 3D* as easily and intuitively as SketchUp does it.<br/>
 * When *printing, a setting to make all lines be black and all else remain colour*, or grayscale, etc. Colour fill and black lines… easily. (CPA is aware of viewport class and layer overrides but this method is onerous.)<br/>
 * A “*drawing set preview*” feature that would show thumbnails of all (or selected) sheet together in a grid.<br/>
 * The ability to *add information to VWX symbols from an external database* (see pain point above for meeting video time where this is discussed.)<br/>
 * Options to easily &amp; quickly *change colours of particular parts of objects or symbols* (i.e exterior panels or the fabric colour of a sofa) in a design to test colour options. Currently they find they must do this using different symbols for the external panels, one symbol per colour option. A system of “symbol styles” may be the kind of thing that would facilitate this.<br/>
 * *Sloped slabs* that allow for a trough and more than 2 drains in a row. Such slabs would allow for drainage off one edge of the slab. (Currently roof faces are being used to simulate this.)<br/>
 * *Spell checking* “on the fly”<br/>
 * *Gimbal or “3D Dragger” control* (as seen in subD modelling) for ALL 3D objects.<br/>
 * Smoother/faster symbols selection<br/>
 * *Site and roadway improvements* (These may be address to an extent with the improvements coming in v2023)<br/>
 * Some Landmark features in Architect (This may be substantially addressed with a v2023 task.)<br/>
 * Roof and slab *fascias*<br/>
 * *Gutter and downspouts*<br/>
 * *Real time rendering* right in Vectorworks<br/>
 * Import/Export viewport settings between files (i.e *Viewport Styles*)<br/>
 * Designating / showing structure / making room for *structure within walls*<br/>
 * Films and thin membranes in wall styles (A workaround to show them in wall schedules is currently being but this will not work for energy analysis with Energos.)<br/>
 * Lockable record format fields to stop the changing of data<br/>
 * *Data visualization persistence in section viewports* (i.e fire ratings) without having to update every time something changes<br/>
 * *Auto-update setting for specific viewports* (They would usually use this for Section viewports)<br/>
 * Cabinet improvements<br/>
 * Finishes and worksheet integration and an easier to change finish “keys” for multiple spaces.<br/>
 * A *world-based size setting for text* so scaling of viewports that contain text in the design layer (I.e for the detailing previously described) is no longer an issue.<br/>
 * *Deprecate old things*. Give fair warning, for example 2 versions, then remove the old stuff (i.e. patterns). Continuing to add new things without removing enough old things is making Vectorworks look more complicated than it truly is. This is a barrier to learning and becoming successful with Vectorworks. <br/>
<br/>
 * Better (smaller) PDF sizes when exporting PDFs<br/>
 * (Roof) Slabs drainage that allows for more than 2 drains in a row, as is commonly built in real life.<br/>
 * Ability to easily connect data in external databases to symbols in Vectorworks, to allow for product specifications to flow from one to the other (without having to use a solution as involved as NBS Chorus).

<br/>
When you put dimensions in the annotations of a non-frontal 3D viewport, the dimension value shown is a screen projected interpretation. However this seems logical for us, for the avarage user this is very confusing, so it is an issue which generates quite some support. If you snap to two points in a perspective viewport, the resulting dimension should show the real distance between these points. Off course, for a frontal view, screen projected is still the best option.

The 2D views other than &#39;Top&#39; are only used in section viewports.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if a user could choose which 2D view to show on top/plan view. Some users are still working in 2D, also for elevations, interior elevations and sections. They would like to choose a symbol and select which view to use for a particular drawing. If a user selects a 2D view other than the Top view, that symbol instance should no longer be considered hybrid.

Problem: Structural member, always draw undesired lines when in shaded mode. There&#39;s no way to get a clean drawing when rendering in Hidden Line. Please, check the attached Vectorworks File.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: Structural member doesn&#39;t have the button &quot;Merge with structural objects in sections&quot;, adding the button mentioned earlier to the structural part and covering part of the structural member options, will solve all the possible outcomes for this problem. Please, check the attached Image File and the Vectorworks File.<br/>
<br/>
Right now all objects (non-PIO objects) have the option, resulting in a correct a fantastic behavior when touching walls, roofs, slabs, and hardscapes with them seamlessly. The only object falling apart in the workflow is the structural member.  <br/>

We had a small but significant amount of requests to be able to show a virtual patch within a device. For example a Dante sound patch from a Yamaha console or Rio interface. We discussed and showed a potential workaround with multiple viewports on a sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
The customer was wondering if it would also be possible to get Yamaha to export the digital Dante patch from the console as a text file and use the create circuits command to draw the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
So it’s a two pronged attack. We should contact Yamaha to ask them to partner and secondly this workflow should be considered, I think it might needlessly complicate any future modular device tool, as the desire is to have circuit connections within a modular device (yikes!).<br/>
<br/>
Happy to also put you in touch with the customer if helpful.<br/>
<br/>
All the best<br/>

Please consider making workspaces save both the size and location or the main VW window along with any docked palettes.  This way users can create workspaces that correspond to the monitor conditions in each working environment they use.

However, when looking at the primary categories of libraries in the lefthand panel of the RM, both &quot;Vectorworks Libraries&quot; and &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; live in the cloud by default as described above, which makes the cloud icon which represents &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; a bit confusing. I&#39;ve had a number of students get confused by the fact that Vectorworks Libraries are also in the cloud until needed, since they assume only Premium Libraries are cloud-based due to the category&#39;s icon.<br/>
<br/>
It would be clearer if the icon for &quot;Premium Libraries&quot; were changed to the diamond icon used on the Service Select content website (see attached screenshot). It would also be more cohesive since the visual branding would match.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud icon would then be reserved for individual files/resources to indicate whether they are local or cloud-based.

<br/>
List browsers often exhibit erratic scrolling behaviors when the user is editing the list contents.<br/>
 This is mostly caused by dialog handlers fully rebuilding the list upon certain user actions.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases it would be possibile to avoid this by handling events in dialogs more precisely.<br/>
 Often this situation is mitigated in VW code by ensuring the selection after the reload is the same as before the reload. In this case the table will scroll so that the edited row is the last visible row. This may be unpleasant for users interacting with the dialog, but it at least ensures that the edited content is visibile.<br/>
<br/>
In other cases it would be easier for the engineer developing the dialog if the list browser had some kind of mechanism to save and restore scroll position of the list.<br/>
I&#39;ve recently something like this for the nav palette to improve scrolling while editing classes.<br/>
<br/>
 What I was thinking about is to add APIs to the SDK list browser to save the list browser scroll position/offset and then restore it when required, while ensuring that the edited item is always visible.

User on the forum claims he specifically needs a line thickness of .025mm as output to a laser for cutting.  When user enters .025mm as a value, it&#39;s rounded up to .03.<br/>
<br/>
From my limited experience with a couple of lasers, only a vector path was needed and line thickness was ignored.  Perhaps higher end lasers allow for varied line thickness?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the forum post:<br/>
<br/>
Hello, if I want the line thickness value set to 0,025mm in VW2022 SP3 (actually: in any version...) it jumps back to 0,03mm.<br/>
<br/>
I need that specific line weight in order to be able to send output to our laser cutting machines. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on finding the right setting to have more than 2 decimals in line thickness?<br/>
<br/>
Spoiler, it&#39;s not in:<br/>
<br/>
Attributes Palette &gt; Pen &gt; Set Thickness (only rounding to 2 decimals)<br/>
Document Settings &gt; Document Preferences &gt; Dimensions (i can only change thickness for the slash),<br/>
Document Settings &gt; Units (that for dims, not thickness),<br/>

Tools &gt; Organization &gt; Classes &gt; Edit &gt; Graphic Attributes &gt; Pen Thickness<br/>

If you are switching between different data visualizations or repeatedly editing a visualization to get it set up properly, having to hit that small target before every action is difficult and annoying.<br/>
<br/>
To have a floating or dockable palette showing the current menu options for data visualization would make visualizations more discoverable and easier to use.

<br/>
1) There is an inconsistency between the white frames of the message center tiles and the lack of frames on the picture tiles on every other pane.  The Home, Learn and Cloud panes all appear flat.  HIGHLY suggest the addition of white frames to all tiles on all panes for consistency.  Additionally, to further define the layout, add a line on the right of the side bar and increase the thickness of the white line at the top of all panes. The sidebar and tiles do not appear to be landed on the HS.  The linework grounds and better defines each.<br/>
<br/>
See images: &quot;Msg Ctr Pane has outlined tiles&quot;, &quot;Suggested linework for all panes&quot; and compare to the flatness of the &quot;Typical Pane - no outlines&quot;.  There is a marked improvement of the clarity and graphics of the panes with the additional linework.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2) The “Mark all as read” and “Delete All” should be the same font size and should align with the &quot;Get Certified, Let Us Do the Heavy Lifting, etc&quot; text on other panes. The “Mark all as read” and “Delete All” should move down to match and verify they are the same font size as on other panes.  <br/>

See images: &quot;Correct height for text&quot; and &quot;Msg Ctr text too high&quot; for clarification.

<br/>
The &quot;Saved Settings&quot; option is not extensive enough. The possibility to define a label and a symbol is missing here.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, it makes sense that after insert a rigging load, a popup opens to define the load. That saves a lot of time. Here you could have the following options in the Style<br/>
- Defined load ; After inserting there is no popup<br/>
- Custom Load ; After inserting, a popup for the definition of the load is opened<br/>

Before T02240 the same point has been used as Anchor Point for the leader line of the Space Label. With VW2023 the Space Label is generated by the Data Tag. This means that this control point has less importance and to the user the reason for the existence of this point isn&#39;t very clear.<br/>
<br/>
To make this more understandable for the user, we should implement it as follows:<br/>
 * We should only show the control point if the Auto-Boundary is set to Auto-Boundary. There is no need for a control point if the Auto-Boundary is set to Manual or Pick-Boundary.<br/>
 * Currently, if the user hovers over the Control Point only &quot;Point&quot; is shown as help text. The text should be changed in &quot;Auto-Boundary origin&quot; (or similar).<br/>
 * We could also add a little icon next to the control point (similar to the Data Tag) that indicates that this point can be used for Auto-Boundary calculation. The icon might be a calculator icon or a wall coverd from a chain.. This can be discussed if we decide to implement this VE.<br/>

</td>

The renderings have to be acheived simple and fast (just a few clicks).This is an important point that VW lacks if compared with the competitors. We think with this 3 improvements, VW renderings will gain much higher quality:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1.: Render lense (color)<br/>
<br/>
When using render modes, users request that the lens of a lighting fixture is visible/ illuminated in the correct color. The video tutorial how to insert a colored lens to any fixture is very helpful. But that&#39;s quite a lot of work, since you are barely using the same fixtures in every project. So you keep on adding lenses to existing fixtures. Ideally the visible lens comes as a standard and is additionally linked to the on/ off function. So only when the fixture is on, the lens shows up in the correct color.<br/>
<br/>
This functionality is implemented in almost all competitor’s applications – also in Vision.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
2.: render beam at full lens diameter<br/>
<br/>
When using render modes, users request that the beam leaves the lighting fixture at the full diameter of the lens. Due to the way light is emitted from lighting fixtures in VW this always seems wrong in renderings.  That makes it impossible to produce high quality lighting renderings for costumers without a third party software. <br/>
<br/>
This functionality is implemented in almost all competitor’s applications – also in Vision.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
3.: Improved workflow for barndoors and shutters for better live feedback <br/>
<br/>
Similar to the 2021 implement improved focus functionality the workflow for barndoors and shutters should follow. Focusing shutters should be possible in a live workflow – similar to the new focus options. <br/>
<br/>
Actually rendered shapes of fixture does not fit to the laborious adjusted wire frame beam shape. When changing the focus, it might get even worse. <br/>
<br/>
We do need a live focus option (like in VISION) that works equally in wire frame, open GL or a render style.  <br/>
<br/>
While the rest of the fixture can appear with a nice soft edge, the edges of the shutters stay always sharp. So the shutters should follow the general sharpness settings (beam/ field angle).  <br/>

Proposal: there should be an option „Display lighting device view“ for a lighting device, which would insert and activate a renderworks camera with the needed parameters<br/>
<br/>
Of course it should respect the shutters.

we got several requests, e.g. PRG, that it&#39;s hardly possible to make a collision control in Spotlight.<br/>
Because Lighting devices are deactivating the indirect lighting.<br/>
Increasing the indirect light doesn&#39;t help here, because the shadowing on the objects itself are needed.<br/>
Making them into a symbol doesn&#39;t help either, because the rotations will be resetted then.<br/>
<br/>
So there is a wish, to have a radiobutton to activate or deactivate the indirect lighting when Lighting devices are inserted.

Better and faster is a worklfow in which you can share the folder / Applications / Vectorworks int 2022 / Plug-Ins / VW_Spotlight / Data directly over a workgroup without first importing the GDTF file into each drawing.

I understand these two parameters fulfill the same function, to set up a scale factor. <br/>

*Recommendation:* to unify the wording by using *scale factor* (for instance, X scale factor and Y scale factor in the first graphic) and retire _scaling factor_. Having two terms to describe the selfsame function affects localization efforts in foreign languages.<br/>

It would be good to have the Formula Bar also zoom to the same scale as the rest of the worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
I often have the worksheet zoomed in 200% or more to make it easier to read. But the formula bar stays at &quot;100%&quot; zoom and is a substantially smaller font size making it much harder to read and use.<br/>
<br/>
And the formulas are usually the most complicated piece of data in a worksheet. The results are usually fairly simple.<br/>

Making the Formula Bar respond to the Zoom command would make editing formulas much easier.

Adjusting the snapping of an LED Wall to hang from the top when inserted/attached to supported truss would allow the user to accurately and efficiently use the LED Wall tool in a ISO view. Not only will this enhancement save the user the time in having to re-adjust the LED Wall, but the change will prevent impeding the user&#39;s work flow when working in 3D.<br/>

 * If a user needs to change the material of multiple structural member objects with different profiles, the user is forced to open the dialog for each structural member object.

This workflow is a regression compared to attributes by class, where you can change the class without entering the profile settings.<br/>
 * Object styles would be a great addition for structural members.<br/>
 * It should be possible to punch holes in structural member objects. In real life steel beams often show holes or have modeled cutouts.

<br/>
Our &quot;Positiv-List&quot; of ports is quite big and many ports are not essentially needed to activate the License and working in Vectorworks. Also our proxy-access requires to write password and username in clear-text into a text file, which looks not good in the eyes of a security focussed system advisor.<br/>

<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/downloading-activating-and-proxy-servers-r82/<br/>
<br/>
What we think would be a welcome (or first) step to improve that situation is to group that urls and ports in &quot;essentially&quot; &quot;recommended&quot; and &quot;licensing&quot; or communicate more precisely for what kind of event an url would be used.<br/>
<br/>
As example one Customer (Axpo Power AG &gt; an Energy Firm like E.On just much smaller :-) <br/>
<br/>
They are not completely isolated from Internet (Users have Internet) and would make some exceptions for Vectorworks but they are restricted. I am a little scared to advice them to open all ports we have on our list. Also good possible, that activation would not work because of proxy or other security arrangements and because of that Vectorworks would be part of a bigger discussion there which could be resulting in danger of not using Vectorworks anymore.<br/>

In the current version we&#39;re forced to create 3 files to do this.<br/>
<br/>
When importing a dwg file from AutoCAD (where dimensions can have any unit), dimensions often get converted to groups because the dimension unit is different than the drawing unit.<br/>
<br/>
Having dimension units per dimension object or style both problems could be solved.

<br/>
A good comparison is the callout tool:<br/>
 * The texts of dimensions always follow the dimension&#39;s pen color, no matter a text style is u. This is a limitation, because in this means that it is never possible to assign a different color to the text than the dimension&#39;s pen color<br/>
 * For a call out tool the text follows the callout&#39;s pen color when no text style is assigned. When a text style is assigned, the color of that text style will be applied. This gives more graphical flexibility and seems more logical to me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if both tools function with a similar logic, consistency throughout tools will be better.

<br/>
For a single component wall:<br/>
 * There&#39;s no sub-parts. The IFC wall&#39;s layer is the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class. This means that the class information given to the component is lost in IFC.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally it would behave in the following way:<br/>
<br/>
For a multi-component wall:<br/>
 * The whole IFC wall&#39;s layer should be the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class.<br/>
 * The assignment of layers to components is as desired at this moment.<br/>

For a single component wall<br/>
 * It should be the same as for multi- component walls. The whole IFC wall&#39;s layer should be the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class and the (only) sub-part&#39;s layer should be the component&#39;s class. Therefore, the single component walls should be exported as a main object with a sub-part, just like multi-component walls.<br/>

<br/>
If you choose a line type via the attributes palette Vectorworks is going to select a line style by default. Currently it is going this way:<br/>
 * Vectorworks always selects the oldest line style in the active document (the first imported or the first created one)<br/>
 * If the document doesn&#39;t contain any line style, the line style &quot;ISO-02 Dashed&quot; is selected from the Vectorworks library by default.<br/>
<br/>
The issue with this logic:<br/>
<br/>
If you select a line type for he first time in an empty document, the line style &quot;ISO-02 Dashed&quot; is immediately imported. This is a line style you never wanted. And because this is and will ever be the first line style ever imported in this document (unless you delete it manually), it will always be the default line style selected by Vectorworks, even if you are never planning to use this one.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I think Vectorworks should use another logic for the default selection. The resource which was chosen the latest tame by the user, would make a lot more sense.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t only count for Line styles, but as well for hatches, tiles and image fills.

<br/>
Revit is resolving this by having a tag system and the tags are transferrable from one object to another. <br/>
<br/>
It would be fab to have a transferrable tag/ID system for Vectorworks objects as well. Don&#39;t know if this would have to be separate from the GUID (for the GUID to comply with BIM360&#39;s &#39;rules&#39;) or if it could be the same.<br/>

<br/>
User wish the fallowing additional options:<br/>
<br/>
*Keep Location of Data Tag*<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the Leader End option above for Data Tags WITHOUT Leader Line. Currently,  Data Tags with no Leader Line will ALWAYS move too if the associated object is moved. But it is desirable that also Data Tags with no Leader line will keep the location even the associated object is moved.<br/>
<br/>
*Move if associated object is reshaped*<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the Data Tag will ALWAYS keep the location if the object is reshaped. It is very desirable that some Data Tags can be moved according to the new shape of the objects. E.g. the Data Tag is placed in the center of a Space object. The Space object will be reshaped and the Data Tag location will be updated to the new center of the reshaped Space.

The top gap can be effected by different lintel arrangements. I&#39;ve not had an example where each side is different (although this can often happen with internal doors), but I can imagine examples where being able to define each side independently would also be required.<br/>
<br/>
Same issue with the door tool:<br/>

To test,<br/>
 # Open a new, blank document.<br/>
 # Press Cmd+S to save.<br/>
<br/>
An error appears saying &quot;No changes to save&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the file is not saved anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
Reasons why a user would like to save a file even though no changes have been made:<br/>
 * A good habit of saving a file in the desired location at the very start.<br/>
 * Marking the time and date for the user&#39;s OS. This allows the user to update the time stamp without having made any changes.<br/>
 * Stops the really annoying popup asking if the user would like to save the file or open the settings to the autosave/backup system.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Save-As is the workaround for the first and third bullets. Bullet #2 is solved by allowing Save to happen anytime a user activates Save regardless of the last time a change was made.

Add &quot;Overkill&quot; command to Vectorworks which is essentially purging coincident objects with a tolerance level. Image two overlapping lines but one is shorter than the other. Vectorworks Purge Coincident Duplicates will disregard this whereas &quot;Overkill&quot; will eliminate the shorter one based on the level of tolerance that has been set.<br/>

Ability to select multiple different objects and scale them based on the individual objects&#39; center point. Currently, when multiple objects are selected and scaled, VW uses the combined center of all objects as the point of reference.<br/>
<br/>
When multiple different symbols are selected there is an option in the Object Info Palette to scale by a factor and the objects stay at their center point. This is desired for any object regardless of type, size, etc. to be able to scale by a factor in the Object Info Palette and keep the objects in place.

Some of our customers asking if it is possible to &quot;Undo&quot; changes that are made in a Vectorworks dialog. Example: You change some values in different tabs in a Vectorworks dialog (e.g. window/door). Now you realize that the preview gives you a wrong result and you would like to undo the last changes made in the different tabs. Currently this is not possible and you have to cancel the dialog first and re-open it and start changing values.<br/>

As aI already mentioned it has a low priority but maybe this can be part of the new &quot;Undo&quot; system.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwkNu9amZM]<br/>
<br/>
One question I&#39;d love answered, for instance, is how important the extra RAM in an M1 Ultra is, for Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
More here from Jonathan Reeves on the beta forum:<br/>
{quote}This may be considered a little of topic, but how about the idea of some kind of Vectorworks Benchmarking system for monitoring and comparing performance. It was wonderful to see Rubina appear on the recent Apple Peak Performance Event videos, talking about Vectorworks. Associations like this are invaluable Kudos for Vectorworks in raising awareness, and presence in the AEC market and the fact Vectorworks is the first mainstream Apple Silicon native CAD/BIM software was the reason this happened.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a Vectorworks Benchmark Application (How about VectorBench as a working title) it could aim to become like Cinebench. This always get used in reviewers with new hardware to use these benchmark Applications to compare performance, especially as its cross platform so reviewers can spare Apples with PC&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
This is obviously an amazing way to raise awareness (think free marketing) of the application. It would alos be incredibly helpful for customers to make informed purchasing decisions for hardware and also Vectorworks Upgrades.<br/>

If you need to modify values in a range of cells in a worksheet it is often convenient to use a formula to modify the values. In Excel you can then copy the results of the formula and put it back into the original cells using Paste Special:Values so that the result is pasted instead of the formula. <br/>
<br/>
VW should have the same ability to paste the result of a formula instead of the formula when desired.

Instead of manually compositing an image object behind an elevation viewport, it would be better to have an option to quickly set the background plate to an image.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(Backgrounds don&#39;t show in RW ortho because these are parallel projection and resolve to a single pixel at most).<br/>

                Stair tool: Option to turn off handrail and/or guardrail at landings

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Currently there does not seem to be a setting that is part of the stair tool to turn off handrails and/or guardrails at stair landings. In reality though, projects will often be built with handrails/guardrails stopping just for the landing portion of what would be a single stair object in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
This means that, at present, users wanting to model such stair designs either need to create an stair+railing combination that is close enough and then ungroup it to modify the railing, or they need to use the stair and railing/fence tool to model each separately. While I have been advising users to do the latter, the feedback is this seems like an unnecessarily complicated way to solve something that could simply be solved by adding a setting to the Stair tool (which, in users&#39; opinions, seems more than capable enough to handle adding this one option.) <br/>
<br/>
It would be great if, for the Stair&#39;s railing setting, both the handrail and guardrail could have the option to not be shown at landings. In conjunction with this, there would also be settings to extend the lower railing N distance past the top of the lower set of steps and start the upper railing N distance before the upper set of steps, as this is often required by local building codes.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Attached below is a rough SkUp drawing I did of the NT Olivier recently. A few thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
1. Over the last few years it feels like SkUp have started to encourage organising objects via ‘Outliner&#39;, rather than Layers (which is now ‘Tags’) …so any detailed object info is nested in Outliner and Tags are more about saving views/groups. It sort of means that SkUp Outliner is now a bit more like VW Classes, rather than VW Layers. So when I import this SkUP drawing in to VW2021, I currently loose a lot of my SkUP detailed drawing organisation. Because all it imports into VW is the ‘Layers/Tags’.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Customer would like the ability to choose how Sketchup Organisation is translated into Vectorworks, In a similar wat the existing Import DWG Command.<br/>
<br/>
They would also like the ability to assign a prefix to imported Sketchup layers/outliners.<br/>

This has been brought up in conversation also a few times for industry specialists having to do workarounds or change workflow for presentations. <br/>
<br/>
Here is an  example of what currently exists with SketchUp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpNbq10UpFo&amp;t=39s <br/>
<br/>
Attached also is a file with 2 different workflows: <br/>
 - Spotlight 3d legend - This allows you to set the rotation of the text i.e right iso/ left iso <br/>
 as well as screen aligned etc.  If viewed from a back view text is not flipped<br/>
- Data tag<br/>
-Callout tool <br/>
<br/>
Ideally if we could get it to work similarly to SketchUp with the screen aligned element for the leader line as well.  Or incorporate a more automated version of the spotlight screen aligned legends into the data tag and callout tool. <br/>

<br/>
Simply the user needs to be able to access the graphic attributes. Perhaps that mean adding functionality to the Class definition. IO do not think a universal or set of document preferences will do the job.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my example. I have a studio full of sets. The set walls or &#39;flats&#39; are simple extrusions. They have assigned classes that control the look. That might just be a paint color using an Attribute Texture, otherwise the wall would have a white fill. <br/>
<br/>
The extrude is likely 3&quot; by some width that will fit in a truck, railroad car or through a loading door by the height. It may have a &#39;reveal&#39; on one or both ends for additional thickness, that part of the flat is likely 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; wide. In plan, I probably want the fill to be black or a hatch with a stroke. <br/>
<br/>
If I change the color of the Class fill, the wall might render black. Yes I know I can and should do a Class Override, but I render, A LOT on Design Layers as part of my process and I am certain I&#39;m not alone.<br/>
<br/>
I can and do draw he 2D and 3D as needed, but if I could control the results, the auto hybrid would save time as any design evolves.<br/>
<br/>
I have not begun to use &quot;Materials&quot; as I don&#39;t think the initial iteration suited my needs. I expect the materials function will evolve and will be of use to me. It might even convince some fabricators to embrace VWX. I hope that the auto hybrid can also embrace materials.<br/>

We have worked a little on these theme and we arrived to something satisfying as a result, but pretty complicated to put in action.<br/>
 # As much as possible have a precise idea of the exact position of the real camera on your surveyor files. We use a lot the manhole covers to do so. We have precise position. And just have to set the height correctly.<br/>
 # Use Cameramatch to have a rough location , set the aperture manually to match real world camera<br/>
 # As you said use the place RW camera to help precisely setup the camera match position to match more precisely the real world camera.  We have fiddled a bit to find our camera precise settings on aperture... once done it&#39;s far better. We set the aperture manually.<br/>
 # Export to twin motion with the RW camera visible- -&gt; don&#39;t forget to explode the camera symbol first<br/>
 # Precisely setup your twin motion camera to match your real world camera aperture.<br/>
 # Use the RW camera 3D objects to position your camera and look in the right direction.<br/>
 # Render in twinmotion.<br/>
 # Back to Vectorworks.... et voilà<br/>
<br/>
*Wishes:*<br/>
<br/>
Could be far more fast if:<br/>
 # Camera mask and camera shadow objects, or similar objects, could be used in viewports WITHOUT a camera match<br/>
 # *OR* camera match camera position could be MANUALLY ADJUSTED IN the 3D view.<br/>
 # Vectorworks coude allow for images PNG transparency layer to be affected by VW gradients!<br/>
 # Twinmotion link could get cameras positions precisely ( a dream would be to find my Vectorworks saved views available in Twinmotion<br/>
 # Twinmotion could display the camera position in the 3D references.<br/>
 # May I had that I d like to be able to easily use an image as my OpenGL background in VW? I could adjust the openGL aperture of my view to match the camera, position my view fast... and so match my camera position.

                                            <td class="description">      There&#39;s currently a magic number (&quot;seed&quot;) in VW&#39;s binary and Plug-In Support (PIS). These seeds must match each other. This was implemented years ago as a way to support additional protection types, and to prevent users from &quot;switching&quot; protection. Of note, Japanese protection aka Series F used this, but was discontinued around 2016.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Mac code signing has arisen and this requires us to package two separate Vectorworks.app bundles in the installers (one for Series B and another for Series E), even though these 1.8GB bundles differ in just a few bytes (the seed is different). Thus, every user of Vectorworks is required to download a much larger file, and this also slows down building (because each app needs to be signed and notarized which includes transfer time to Apple and more time on Apple&#39;s servers) and uses more storage and time to transfer files, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In addition the whole PIS matching system makes it more difficult for users to change their protection (it requires a reinstall), and this makes it more difficult to move users off of Series Be and onto series E for example.<br/>
<br/>
I have a two-part proposal:<br/>
1) Seed unification: There&#39;s currently no benefit of having different seeds for series B and E. I want to make them both use the series E seed. Kamen has said there&#39;s no security benefit to having different seeds, and that it would be a minor change that has no user impact. I would like to do this as soon as possible (for mainline which will become VW2023) so we can immediately start reaping the benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the following seeds would still exist with seed unification:<br/>
Viewer - has its own seed (but not packaged in main installers)<br/>
Series A - we build series A. It might be worthwhile to just move everyone to series E builds but this isn&#39;t really a problem currently - at least not one that&#39;s relevant here.<br/>
<br/>
2) PIS removal: This is more complex, but basically means doing away with the PIS module and finalize removing our protection into the core of VW itself. I say finalize because Kamen has already done most of this -- the functionality for protection was moved to VW core in VW2019/VW2020. All that remains is the seed match and the determination of which protection to use, which remains in the PIS module.<br/>
<br/>
This would simplify VW somewhat, allow users to switch protections (based on serial) but would have some end user changes that Kamen can outline. We would need to address Viewer and this would probably require removal of Series A (local builds). I do think there are also benefits of keeping the protection code up to date and removing unnecessary complexities, both to reduce the surface for possible attacks and as best practice for ensuring efficacy. <br/>

This looks to be WAD? so I am submitting as an enhancement.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is from the user.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if I could get assistance on the following issues involving the MEP circuiting tool<br/>
<br/>
The help entry on this tool makes no mention of the fact that the circuiting tool will not work for receptacles that have been inserted into walls. Thus the tool works in reverse to most normal practices. Receptacles inevitably are inserted into some entity be it a wall, floor, ceiling.  I discovered this after extensive searching on the forum and found an entry from 12 years ago! I guess it has never been fixed. 12 years is a long time for an outstanding bug. The process appears to remain inserting receptacles without attaching to walls circuiting them and then attaching to walls<br/>
<br/>
The actual graphic circuit indicators do not track if an outlet is being moved. Is there a way of having the wire connections associate to the receptacle insertion point or centre of the symbol?

These people have a mix of German and US English Vectorworks and that&#39;s where the problems start. In ConnectCAD some PIO use symbols as part of their draw (very handy because users can customise the symbol). Now when a user takes a file originating on German Vectorworks and opens it on English Vectorworks there&#39;s a symbol in the document called Anschluss but our software is looking for Socket...<br/>
<br/>
This makes Vectorworks less useful for international teams. We could solve this by having universal names and localized names.

                                            <td class="description">      VW comes pretty close but fails to give us the tools to export drawings to DWG using Enterprise CAD standards which are a requirement of federal government projects among others.  This requires us to maintain AutoCAD in order to clean up the DWG files.  Below is the list of items that I believe would fix this allowing us to export each VW sheet to DWG files meeting compliance.<br/>
<br/>
* Export option for strict naming to prevent VW from appending / renaming the DLVP name with &quot;(2D)&quot; when it exports them as separate referenced files.<br/>
(We name the DLVPs how we want the referenced files to be named.)<br/>
<br/>
* Export option to choose a custom name for the layers VW creates in the DWG file that are used for the crop boundary and referenced files. <br/>
(The layer naming convention is very specific in Enterprise standards.)<br/>
<br/>
* Export option to choose if you want the references to be relative or absolute.  <br/>
(VW defaults to making the references absolute which is strictly forbidden.  They must be relative.)<br/>
<br/>
* VW needs to export text styles to the DWG file as it already does for dimension styles.<br/>
<br/>
* VW needs to give us an export option to rename the None class when it makes it a layer in the DWG file or to move everything on the None class to the 0 layer upon export eliminating the None layer usage.  <br/>
(&#39;None&#39; is a non-compliant name.)<br/>
<br/>
 feel like all are reasonably attainable options to create in the export DWG dialog and would have a fairly big upside by bringing VW more into the main stream to be usable for projects like these.  Government projects are a huge A/E sector and they are not the only ones that require Enterprise CAD Standard compliance, or at least some level of compliance that requires one or more of these options.  That&#39;s a lot of projects out there.  Just in the US we are talking about billions of dollars of project value.<br/>
<br/>
I would think this kind of flexibility in VW would be good for business.  We&#39;ve struggled with this for years now but the cost / complexity dynamic is getting notably worse as of late.  Maintaining AutoCAD simply for these kinds of projects to clean up VW exports on top of having Revit and VW is becoming unsustainable.

 <br/>
Every time one exports a sheet layer to a DWG file with the option to export DLVPs as separate referenced files, VW will append the name of those DLVPs (which becomes the file name) with &quot;(2D)&quot;.  Now these files are referenced with the appended file name.  This desperately needs to stop.  Anyone doing federal government work in the US must comply with Enterprise CAD standards which have very strict file naming conventions.  We need to export every sheet with all our drawings, title blocks and backgrounds as separate referenced files with a very specific naming convention.  We accomplish this by naming the DLVP that will be exported appropriately. This would otherwise work fine if VW didn&#39;t append those names.<br/>
 <br/>
Now we have to open all these files and re-reference them in AutoCad after deleting that additional text in the file name.  This is so frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* give us a simple option in the export to DWG dialog for &quot;Strict Naming&quot; that will not allow VW to append these files names.

Enhancing the command to only reset the ID&#39;s of objects that are duplicates and giving the user the choice over which is reset would make it far easier for the user to use the command without risking losing the ID&#39;s of objects that don&#39;t have a problem.<br/>
This would be a very good quality of life improvement for the command

 * They are sorted as they are imported. There&#39;s no way to re-sort them. An automated way of sorting them by name, or RGB values would be great.<br/>
 * Colors in the active file can&#39;t be named.<br/>
 * The exact same color (i.e. black) can appear twice in the same color grid or list. There should be a way to merge the same colors.<br/>
 * Colors can&#39;t be deleted from the grid. It would be useful to be able to delete a color and get a request to select another color for the existing objects using that color.

<br/>
When making sales calls to potential customers, looking at the usage section for Evaluation Licences there is useful information. In particular the &#39;Days Used&#39; column.<br/>
<br/>
In conversation with [~swood] I believe that this only indicates how many times the program has been opened. So for example, a really keen potential customer might be trialling the software everyday for 30 days, but if they have only opened it once then the column would read 1/30. Thus, this isn&#39;t showing the actual usage.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, what would be really informative would be the following:<br/>
 # How long it has been +actively+ used and over how many hours/days. <br/>
 # How many times it has been opened and closed.<br/>
 # If it has crashed.<br/>
 # Information on the computer it is installed on. At least the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
I realise some of this might be something similar to what the Tableau Desktop can do except it doesn&#39;t look at EVALS and isn&#39;t updated daily.<br/>
<br/>
If I can see that a potential customer has only opened it once and for 10 minutes over the 30 days I can conclude that it was probably only to open a file. They would still be followed up but not as a priority compared to those whose activity is more strikingly obvious.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for any consideration.<br/>

For section viewports, this problem can be easily solved by choosing 1 class for the graphics behind the cut plane. A similar option should exist for regular viewports in hidden line render.

<br/>
Customers who accidentally explore this fill/pen type are usually thinking they are using a hatch and are confused by its behaviour. In the best case, they will contact support so we can advice them to use other fill types. In the worst case, they are just dissatisfied by its functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Patterns do cause a lot of issues while printing to large scale plotters. Plans get cut off after 10cm because of a plotter memory overload.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason patterns are still used is to get &#39;grey&#39; fills in &#39;black and white only&#39; viewing and printing.<br/>
<br/>
If the black and white only would be replaced or completed by a greyscale view, patterns could be sent to the legacy.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I think &quot;patterns&quot; should be hidden by default in the attributes palette. To ensure backwards compatibility and keep the option for users who really want to use it, the user can have the option to enable it under &quot;legacy 2D&quot;, just like &quot;screen plane&quot; options and &quot;unified view&quot; options.

<br/>
As an example I often prepare, not unreasonably, a schedule of space in a worksheet which lists the rooms by number and use, length and width, height, area and volume. At the concept stage this is a clear and convenient way to confirm to clients the sizes without cluttering the concept drawings with dimensions. If the building isn&#39;t aligned to X and Y axes the reported dimension aren&#39;t correct. If the layer view is rotated using the rotate plan tool, the plan can be made to look like it is aligned to x and y but the space length and width are still reported incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
One approach might be to use the plan rotate angle to &#39;correct&#39; the length and width.<br/>

An alternative could be to test for rectilinear spaces, and if true, report their actual side dimensions, not Ymax - Ymin and Xmax - Xmin. Then the reported room dimensions  wouldn&#39;t be affected by alignment to the main axes. If the test is false, then don&#39;t return a dimension. <br/>

Actually the planes palette doesn&#39;t do much but the main thing you want to do here is to make a new named plane.<br/>
<br/>
So I suggest that we add a *New..* option right there in the menu and revert the options.. button to opening the planes menu so you can edit the named planes (or have an *Edit...* button that allows this)<br/>
<br/>
I realise that many people may not use named working planes but nonetheless I think it would be helpful and logical.

I get this pop-up a lot in congested documents when I accidentally click on the wrong thing.

A case could also be made for the full pop-up appearing once per session, but then being able to suppress future warnings to the Status Bar.<br/>

Pop-ups are generally annoying so hopefully we can move away from them in order to speed up workflow.

                More flexibility to isolate objects for modelling, filtering, BCF workflow (single object visibility)
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      There are several workflows where the possibility is missing to have a more accurate way to hide and show objects. Currently objects can be hide/shown by using classes or layers.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you use a BCF workflow to manage your issues this is often not good enough. It might be that a combination of objects are affected which cannot be isolated just with classes and layers. You often have too much or to less objects visible if you select an issue in BCF manager. A clip cube can help but customers expect that the objects they see in an issue match exactly the view in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A better way to isolate objects (single object visibility) would not only solve the BCF work-flow issue it would also allow to isolate object when modeling in 3D. Currently users create a group and double-click it to isolate the grouped objects.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The possibility of single object visibility would also catapult Vectorworks in other spheres if it comes to filtering objects. Filtering by name or other attributes would be possible and also dataviz and criteria dialog could benefit from that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of our partner develop a classification plug in and need exactly the possibility to hide and show objects on id level. Classes and Layers are too limited for a bunch of work-flows.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I’m sure that there are more other areas inside Vectorworks who would benefit from this possibility too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Would be nice to get a kind of single object visibility in the near future.

Some customers of us do work like saving in the background (option confirm before save off) every few minutes und testing parts or preparing symbols in new untitled documents. Pretty soon there’s a message plopping up, that you first have to save this untitled document before it can saved by backup copy. If you work with those untitled documents only a short time for testing or preparing symbols, and you create man of them just when you need them, then this message can be very annoying. So the wish for an option to exclude unsaved documents from backup. Once they are saved, they can be backuped. But only then.

Use cases: One of our partners develops a Vectorworks PlugIn which connects to an online service and attache automatically a classification cost code to an object with some specific information. E.G. If the wall is external and it is  load bering then automatically the code C.2.2 is attached to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
This third party developer want to be able to create/edit/delete data visualization definitions and be able to make them aktiv or inactive. This would allow to check automatically which objects already got some code, which ones did not and is the attached code correct.<br/>
<br/>
As a distributor we also have similar functionality (E.g. buildUp) and ongoing developments where an automated data visualization would be very useful too. Because of the excellent possibilities of Data Viz we would appreciate to have access to the features using SDK.

This is very useful for the Plant tool, now that Laubwerk provides accurate plant shapes.<br/>

The request is to make the Image Prop orient itself in Wireframe too. This way the plant shape will be placed correct with the rest of the drawing.<br/>

                Criteria interface: add &quot;contains&quot; and other logic operators for Classes &amp; Layers
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      As discussed in this thread: [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/83571-0500-t02214_criteria_improvements/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=416101]<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently the criteria interface only provides the operators &quot;is&quot; and &quot;is not&quot; for Classes and Layers. We should also have the ability to use the operators &quot;starts with,&quot; &quot;does not start with,&quot; ends with,&quot; &quot;does not end with,&quot; &quot;contains, and &quot;does not contain&quot; to allow for much greater flexibility. Not only would this make it more consistent with Class &amp; Layer Filters which already utilize these operators, but it would make creating the appropriate criteria much faster and more flexible.<br/>
<br/>
One use case is making it easier to isolate collections of Classes/Layers that all have a similar category name (for example I might have Classes such as &quot;SET-Walls,&quot; &quot;SET-Floor,&quot; &quot;SET-Platform,&quot; etc. which could easily be isolated together by setting the criterion to &quot;Class&quot; &quot;contains&quot; &quot;SET&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
This would also allow for additional Classes/Layers to be included in the criteria results as more Classes/Layers are added to the file, instead of having to remember to go back and edit your criteria every time you add a new one.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, while it&#39;s possible to manually type in criteria into worksheets to get around this missing ability in the criteria dialog box, it&#39;s not currently possible to manually type in criteria for Data Visualizations.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding UI, it would be the same as it is for criteria that already support this ability (eg. Name or Symbol).

In this perspective mode, all the vertical lines are perpendicular to the bottom of page, this makes the renderings look a lot better. <br/>
<br/>
Enscape has this perspective mode, which is very useful. But Vectorwork&#39;s lack of &#39;two point perspective&#39; makes the process of working with Enscape cumbersome.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, to achieve two-point perspective in Enscape, the Vectorworks workflow is as follows:<br/>
- we go to activate our &#39;saved views&#39; in Vectorworks, <br/>
- Sync perspective to Enscape <br/>
- Check that we have the correct view in Enscape<br/>
- Then go back to Vectorworks to &#39;disable&#39; perspective sync (Two Point Perspective in Enscape doesn&#39;t work with perspective sync enabled, and VW does not have Two Point Perspective)<br/>
If Vectorworks has two-point perspective mode, then a lot of steps can be saved.

One of the issues is the lack of complete control over rendering textures in the way that Redshift will handle them.<br/>
It would be great if, just like Enscape for Vectorworks, we get a full version of Redshift renderer including ability to create textures and lighting just for redshift. <br/>
See enclosed window from a real redshift material editor. <br/>
This is critical as our model grows more complex, the link to Enscape, each time we launch it, becomes longer. <br/>
Redshift if used properly can significantly reduce that time spent to launch another app (time-cost issue)

It would be much more appreciated if you don&#39;t have to use a wildcard to get desired results.<br/>
Desired scenario:<br/>
For example, if you type &quot;chair&quot;, you should get both &quot;chairs&quot; and &quot;armchairs&quot;, basically each resource that contains the &quot;chair&quot; word in its resource name. <br/>
Right now, to see &quot;armchairs&quot;, you&#39;d have to type &quot;*chair&quot; and not every client would know that.

A truss has its Z height set to the bottom of the truss. Having a top trim on the projector will allow a user to enter the truss Z height for trim and the projector will attach to the underside of the truss.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the top trim option allows users who place their projectors on top of truss to keep the same workflow.

<br/>
I found some by just testing at our network, but this is not helpful or professional to just guess.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the Sophos (XG550) Firewall on Version 18.x has a setting for &quot;Web filtering&quot; this worked before and the customer needed to make a special rule for the Site Activation Server where this feature is on setting &quot;none&quot; instead of &quot;Allow All&quot; (see screenshots)<br/>
As they discribed it seems like in the communication there is a switch of the Server answering on your side and at this point a reset was send instead of this switch - probably because the second server was just blocked so the first send the reset.<br/>
After changing the setting described above the activation was just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I also attached a Wireshark file, I think you should be able to get the information needed from there because you know which IPs are relevant to this.<br/>
<br/>
It feels like just making an exception for &quot;site-activation.vectorworks.net&quot; seems not enough, or the reverse dns entries <br/>

I support bigger customers and I&#39;m talking to IT-Admins directly.

However, the origin is only a snap point in Top/Plan currently. It needs to be snappable in 3D views as well.<br/>
<br/>
For example if I go to a front view and start drawing the elevation of a piece of furniture in order to start extruding it into a 3D model, being able to snap the bottom of my geometry  to the origin would be incredibly useful so that the model ends up sitting on the ground without extra steps.<br/>
<br/>
Taking it one step further, in front/back/side views I&#39;d love for the entire line of the ground plane (Z=0) to be snappable. That would make it easier to place things on the ground plane when I drag them up and down on the screen without needing actual ground plane geometry to snap to.

*Bonus Points* towards having the tool stop and pop an error when one runs out of the chosen connector definition. If I choose OutA.120V, it should allow me to keep assigning new connections until it hits a different connector type. In this case, when it changes the Voltage from 120 to 208.

<br/>
When a dialog is close with a simple OK and no change to the settings, the next time that command is invoked it should proceed without a dialog. And we should show an &quot;Oops&quot; button that the user clicks if that wasn&#39;t the expected result. &quot;Oops&quot; undoes the previous command and re-issues the command showing the dialog this time.<br/>

It would be useful to have to option for plug-ins to add their context menus at the top of the list right next to the cursor. My 2c worth is that this will be a better guess as to the user&#39;s intentions.<br/>

The problem arise when she was not able to calculate a section on a iMac i9 32Giga ram, and asked me to see how work my MacBook Pro 14&quot; M1Max 64Giga, either using 2022 and 2020.<br/>
The file is the project for the &quot;Torre Piloti&quot; of Genoa harbour by Renzo Piano, and she is working for executive design.<br/>
<br/>
Using 2022<br/>
The file opened fast, and using the clip cube is real time.<br/>
Indeed, creating a Section Viewport VW dismiss the settin window in near 2 seconds the first time and near instantly the subsequent.<br/>
The setting are in the attached windows; the viewport windows show up after rougly 1&#39; 30&quot; in the various timing I made:<br/>
<br/>
VW2022<br/>
sheet layer 72 dpi<br/>
2” to close the window;<br/>
1’ 25” to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
sheet layer 300 dpi (made after the previous one) <br/>
windows close almost instantly when pressin OK;<br/>
1’ 32&quot; to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using 2020<br/>
I had to test also using 2020 because Lorenza at work on this project has to use 2020:<br/>
<br/>
VW2020<br/>
sheet layer 72 dpi<br/>
10” to close the window;<br/>
3’ 15” to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
sheet layer 300 dpi<br/>
10”to close the window;<br/>
4’ 40” to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And continuing to work on this test file creating more section slow more and more.<br/>
Apparently there are no much use of CPU and memory (seen using Resource Monitor)<br/>
<br/>
I belive that VW2022 native on Apple Chip is no so speedy as one might expect; perhaps is necessary some more optimization.<br/>
Really, Lorenza told me that detailed section are essential for verifying the correct intersection between slab and wall and other components, and she use to do a lot during the design process. One minute and half is too much.<br/>
<br/>
Attached you will find the drawing. Feel free to ask more info either to me or to Lorenza.

<br/>
Is it possible to make feature videos more accessible?<br/>
Right now, they are available in the Manual. To get access to them, you have to first open the right page in the User Manual and click the video link (2-step-procedure). As of Vectorworks 2022, video links are embedded in the Manual, which is a great UX improvement (see: [https://help2022.designexpress.eu/vwhelp/2022/PL/VW2022_Guid]<br/>
<br/>
But it would be nice to go even further, namely: to place a(n) button/icon next to &quot;What&#39;s this&quot; button in the title balk of dialog boxes with a direct link to such an video. The video should open as an pop-up in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to add an extra link in the dialogs for those plug-ins which have a video link available? See screenshot<br/>

Notice that this field only accepts a number.  but the cost could be a franks, USD, CAD.  There is nothing in the dialog indicating the currency and the field does not accept something like 27.05 USD. Being able to set this on either a product level or project level and have it displayed in this dialog I think would be beneficial.

Rather than asking each other that (sometimes we work remotely which is even harder), can we have a button to ‘request user to save and commit&#39;<br/>

No matter what my last numbering session ended with. <br/>
<br/>
So, I wish there was a setting I could pick (and save in a saved style) to &quot;Restart Numbering Each time&quot; or something like that. So if that box was checked, every time this dialog was opened, the Start value defaulted to 1.<br/>

This is how the numbering works in [~jbenghiat]&#39;s Savvy Select Similar Instrument plugin and, I believe, his Savvy Sequencer plug-in, and it&#39;s much better.

At the moment we have a lot of different stylesystems:<br/>
<br/>
*Wall-, Slab-, Roofstyles*<br/>
If you edit a wallstyle you can choose which values should override from the new (changed) values and which not.<br/>
It&#39;s not possible to define if a value is from style or not.<br/>
You can create a new style in the wall settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
*PIO-Styles (f.ex Columns)*<br/>
In the OIP you can hide all styled parameters.<br/>
To define which values are from style you have to open two dialogs.<br/>
You cannot create a new style in the column settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
*Windows &amp; Doors*<br/>
In the OIP you can hide all styled parameters.<br/>
To define which values are from style you have only to edit the style<br/>
You cannot create a new style in the column settings dialog.<br/>
<br/>
From my point of view we should reduce to one stylesystem and change the existing tools in a multiple year project. It is desirable to change the dialogs of these tools simultaneously to Triptychon.<br/>
<br/>
The User Experience for working with styles will signifcantly rise!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Turning off snapping is not an acceptable solution to this as I still need to snap the light to my aligned tick marks in my hanging position. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told this new feature is &quot;WAD&quot; but I don&#39;t know anyone who agrees with this behavior or finds it helpful. I would direct you towards this discussion here:<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/90102-when-i-place-a-light-on-a-hanging-position-why-is-vw-automatically-rotating-the-light/]<br/>
<br/>
If VW thinks this is useful behavior (and I still would like to hear an argument for how this is useful based on the way light plots are actually created) then at the very least, there needs to be a way to toggle it on and off. Either the setting above should apply to both 2D and 3D, or there should be another setting to control 2D behavior. This is a major regression of efficiency and I think that would&#39;ve been made fairly clear in discussions with Spotlight users in the Beta Group before the implementation.  <br/>

<br/>
When my hand is on the external mouse, I would like the actual mouse wheel to zoom. But, when using 2-finger swiping on my MacBook Pro multi-touch trackpad, I would like the 2-finger swipes to pan because that is much more natural and because the trackpad supports pinch-to-zoom.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, Vectorworks responds correctly to my trackpad when &quot;Enable Mouse Wheel Zooms&quot; is false, but it responses correctly to my external mouse when &quot;Enable Mouse Wheel Zooms&quot; is enabled. There is no way to set it so it works as I want for both input devices at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Please either give us two distinct controls, or even just make this preference not apply to the trackpad at all and make it only toggle behavior of an external mouse.

The process of having to select the whole parent instrument, and then use a drop-down in the OIP to drill down to a specific child cell is much too cumbersome and slow. Plus, as [~jbenghiat] noted in VB-172014, there is no visual indicator in the drawing window of which cell is selected. <br/>

Please give us some way to directly, visually, select a single cell or multiple cells. Maybe clicking with a modifier key? Or even right-clicking and selecting a context menu option for &quot;Select this Cell&quot;. Or something? We just need something faster and more direct than the fiddly little drop-down in the OIP.

<br/>
This is a collection request for the management of dimensions:<br/>
 * Dimensions should be resources<br/>
 * Purge unused dimension standards with the command &quot;Purge&quot;<br/>
 * Identically Look of Dimensions in different versions (Englisch, French, German)<br/>
 * No longer mix page and world based values<br/>
 * Thickness of line end markers as part of the dimension standard<br/>

<br/>
In the User Interface a clearer separation of Vectorworks Preferences and Document Preferences would be desirable. For this step the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot; should change to a tryptichon dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
 * Edit Marker List... -&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Vectorworks Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Line Thickness.... -&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Vectorworks Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Units...-&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * Georeferencing...-&gt; should integrated in the dialog &quot;Document Preferences&quot;<br/>
 * ...<br/>
<br/>
Why is this wish a improvement for Vectorworks?<br/>
<br/>
In order for the Vectorworks experience to be “easier to learn and easier to use” while, simultaneously, “improving the experience for current customers” this task reduce the preferences dialogs in the workspace and shows clearly which preferences are saved in the document and which are saved with Vectorworks<br/>

                Door hardware texture only comes through when assigned by Class

<br/>
It would seem this has always been the case with Door Hardware going back to previous versions. However it would be great if it just came through from the symbol if a texture is assigned. <br/>
<br/>
Email from a user for context: <br/>
<br/>
_I noticed this a while back then was caught out by it again this week so thought I’d forward it to you for comment._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_I have some 3D door hardware symbols that use a brushed stainless steel texture. When this texture is assigned to the 3D geometry within the symbol definition *by object* (in the Render tab of the OIP) or *by Material* (in the Shape tab of the OIP), the texture will not show up on the objects within the Door PIO. In order for the door hardware to display the correct texture in the model you have to assign the texture *by class*. If you don’t set the texture by class the door hardware, when selected within the door settings, will display as white (no texture) in the model._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_Is this working as designed or a bug?_<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_If I have a 3D symbol of a stainless steel door handle, that geometry is only ever going to have a stainless steel texture applied to it. This is why I originally specified the texture by object within the symbol definition: because I wanted it to be set fast + not subject to change. I have no need to control its appearance by class. Its finish is only ever going to be brushed stainless steel._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_When I realised that assigning the texture by object this way resulted in white door handles in the model I went back + assigned the texture by class + all was fine._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_Several months later I’ve forgotten this + have started using Materials (which I think are great by the way). I create a ‘Brushed Stainless Steel MT’ Material because I realise that I’ve been using a few different stainless steel textures across my objects/files + actually none of them render particularly well, so I create my own new texture + assign it to a Material + in this way can have a single ‘Brushed Stainless Steel MT’ Material that I can go to every time I have a brushed stainless steel object + very easily achieve consistency throughout + never have to try + remember which is the right texture to choose each time. Except that after assigning the new Material to my door hardware symbols I notice that the texture isn’t displaying in the models + I can’t figure out why, until I remember what happened before + have to go back + reassign the textures by class._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_To be clear: I am quite happy assigning the jamb/leaf textures by class as I have different classes for different colours/finishes + I can choose the appropriate class depending on the colour/s the door/frame needs to be, inside + out. But the hardware is slightly different in that it’s not part of the PIO as such: it is a 3D symbol that you’d expect to be able to control separately._<br/>
<br/>
 __ <br/>
<br/>
_So be good to know whether this is a bug or is simply how it’s always been + is likely to remain._<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
we want to share a workgroup folder via VCS. So I am creating a folder with everything in it. I am Sharing it with a collegue and dont want him to edit it, so he has &#39;view and Download&#39; permission. To be sure he can use it with Vectorworks, he has to send it to the starting Screen (home-folder) of VCS. Now he sees it locally and is able to use of his Group-folder.<br/>
But whenever I am changing something within the shared folder, my collegue will never see it within his folder he sent to the starting screen (Only in &#39;shared with me&#39; section).<br/>
Means, he has to delete the folder on the starting screen and need to add the shared folder again to it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise my collegue needs full edit rights to synchronize this folder to the home screen automatically. But that&#39;s something I don&#39;t want to do.<br/>

Viewport parameters are also a little overwhelming for new users. It would be great to implement OIP Widget Groups for Viewports so that parameters are arranged into categories with headers, making it easier to find what you need.<br/>
<br/>
Implementing widget groups would be a great opportunity to reorganize parameters so that related settings are near each other. For example, Lighting Options and Image Effects affect the rendered portion of a viewport so they should be near the Background Render setting. There are currently a number of cases where the order of things in the OIP seems arbitrary and scattered, rather than presented logically.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached images I’ve laid out mock-ups of a Viewport and a Section Viewport OIP. I’ve carefully rearranged all the parameters into simple categories that I think would make sense to an average user. I’d be happy to further explain any logic behind these choices and why things are grouped and ordered the way they are.<br/>

If I am imagining this then this needs to be added.  If I am remembering correctly this needs to be brought back.  Suppose I have a group of circles, arranged in a semicircle.  Now I ant to duplicate and offset the duplicates by a few feet to make a second row.  I do not want the circles to be bigger, I do want the semicircle to be bigger.  This I do believe used tow ork and no longer does.

<br/>
Quick search should include the options within Vectorworks Preferences, Document Preferences, Spotlight Preferences, Units, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It could also include Snap settings (for example a user could search for &quot;Tangent&quot; or &quot;Master Snap Points&quot;) though there&#39;d have to be consideration for how the Quick Search interface interacts with the Utility Bar buttons and pop-overs.<br/>

Currently you have to click on each segment that you want to remove.<br/>

It would be great to also have the option to be able to click and hold and move the cursor over multiple segments, and have all the segments that you moused over be removed in one stroke. This could save a LOT of clicking in certain scenarios. It would even be beneficial for removing individual segments: it requires less precise clicking, thereby saving our already overworked wrists.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve attached a video of a scenario I encountered today - the first half shows me using the Trim tool as it currently functions, then I hit undo several times, then I demonstrate the clicking and holding mouse strokes that would be used if this enhancement were implemented (Of course it doesn&#39;t do anything but hopefully you get the idea). Each segment would be trimmed away AS you mouse stroke over it.<br/>

<br/>
Railings are something that can go beyond a stair and are found in many places other than stairs, so by having railings built into the stair tool as well as a separate tool for railings, Vectorworks is doubling up on development effort. These tools should be separated out, so that Vectorworks can focus on making each of them excellent at what they need to do and so that use users can focus on modelling separate elements with less limitations and less variables to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
The more I model with Vectorworks the more I want to break things down into separate elements so that there are less variables and connections to think about. When too many things are bundled up into one tool it creates limitations that don&#39;t exist in the real world. Fine if you&#39;re modelling a square box. Not fine otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking slabs and roofs down into internal finishes, structure and external finishes is a good example of this. And it makes even more sense to me to do this with railings and stairs.

{color:#de350b}// Would be nice but probably not easy to implement.{color}<br/>
 # The Angle profile should be rotated 180° so the top axis default alignment is to a leg face, not air. Most structural elements are installed utilizing Top of Steel elevation concepts.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// Certainly makes sense to me.{color}<br/>
 # There needs to be an edit mode to permit addition components and subtraction subtraction components. The insertion of one or more creating selection node(s) which can be dragged outside of the edit mode to relocate the component&#39;s position along the member&#39;s axis. I would suggest that the axis the components nodes snap to be the top centre axis. These components being 3d symbols or possibly 3d plugin geometry. The former is suited for adding stiffener plates, saddles and connection plates or angles among other things. The latter might be suitable for tools that arrange holes in the flanges or the web or for coping ends of Wide flanges. The ability of a component to remain either plumb to the layer or perpendicular to the axis of sloped members is also a consideration.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I&#39;ve seen similar abilities wished for from users.{color}<br/>
 # Being able to snap to those (in #4) nodes with dimensioning tools.<br/>
 # The ability to lock in a slope angle when altering the length of the member is also valuable for sloping steel roof and canopy structures; As is being able to set an angle as an alternative to setting an end elevation.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I see this wished for *often* by users.{color}<br/>
 # Component edit mode being accessible from the resource palette similar to how symbols are handled. That way all beams can be seen and their member IDs are also available for editing. Beams when placed in a plan layout may start out as being multiple instances like symbols but may need to be duplicated and edited as the development process continues.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// I believe he wants *Styles* for the Structural Member.{color}<br/>
 # This is a very useful one and should be a wishlist item of its own: Have a Viewport type which can generate a beam or symbol from the definition. (for placement on sheet layers) Talking 3d here and all the various views that the basic Viewport can display. This creates an easy means to annotate each beam and symbol. Avoids possibly hundreds of classes and or layers being required to control visibility. The current process of laying out beams for a structure is still required but all the layout of each beam would be tremendously simplified and can utilize templates for annotation. One only needs to remember that all symbols and beams be created at their internal origin for best functionality.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// This is a more general &quot;Object View&quot; or &quot;Object Viewport&quot; wish.<br/>
// *NOTE*: *Graphic Legends* actually may be exactly the thing he&#39;s looking for.{color}<br/>
 # Having the Viewport mentioned above being able to tap into the member id and or symbol name to facilitate automatic labeling. Or would that be the other way around where labels in the Viewport tap into those ids and names?<br/>
 # Profile size should be editable as a pull down at the root level of the OI, not embedded behind a shape selection button.<br/>
 # The technical data that the individual members currently provide should be displayed in the OI or accessible from the OI via a button. Weight characteristics for the basic member is a useful piece of data that is currently not provided.<br/>
{color:#de350b}// This would be valuable and easy to implement.{color}<br/>
 # Custom sizes as currently provided in the individual member tools is also useful for those sizes that are not in the predefined setting. This is helpful when using bar angle, bar channel and some tubing sizes which are currently not in the selection lists.

Since the files work and keep their reference when they are moved to the local hard drive, the issue must be with the way their new server is set up.<br/>

We never recommend working directly off of a server as many different issues can happen.<br/>

Response from ICT client after reading TechSupport&#39;s response:<br/>
<br/>
This is not a wrong setting of the server. Zeedrive makes a connection with sharepoint in Vectorworks thinking it&#39;s a network drive but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s an active link to Sharepoint with for example to the drive letter P. Vectorworks should follow the drive P and not //kabaz//. <br/>
<br/>
Can you look into this and make Vectorworks compatible with ZEE drive and sharepoint?

<br/>
The current workflow with GDTF data is confusing. We have 2 files in the library for one Lighting device type.<br/>
1. Lighting device<br/>
2. GDTF file<br/>
<br/>
If you import the GDTF file and insert it into the drawing you have a 2D / 3D symbol. This is confusing for the customer. He is expecting a lighting device here.<br/>
<br/>
You have to insert the lighting device into the drawing and then import the GDTF file into the document.<br/>
If the GDTF file has been imported into the document, the GDTF mode must also be selected in the OIP of the lighting device. That takes time. The user does not want to have to do two imports here.<br/>
<br/>
It would be better to have a folder for GDTF files, independent of the lighting device library.<br/>

This approach might provide all the flexibility needed for:<br/>
(i) the User (to couple whatever Plant Style they like with whatever Globe Plant asset they choose),<br/>
(ii) for Globe Plants (to quickly expand their library with low poly versions of their content for use in Vw) and ultimately<br/>
(iii) to relieve someone of the onerous task of building Vw Plant Styles with Globe Plant meshes.

While it makes sense for this to occur when zoomed out really far, the zoom threshold for this is currently way too low which is quite unhelpful. Users often need to be able to evaluate a drawing or sheet from a zoomed out point of view, but when dashed lines are misrepresented as solid it can be misleading.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s confounding is that the dashes can be seen when panning and/or actively zooming, but when simply viewing the drawing they&#39;re shown as solid. So clearly there are plenty of screen pixels available to display these dashes.<br/>

Attached is a video demonstrating what I&#39;m talking about. To be clear, the way it looks when zooming and panning is what&#39;s desired, and that same level of fidelity should be displayed when not zooming/panning.

<br/>
This I think needs to change. The clear space should be the &#39;stall width&#39; and the partition thicknesses should be in addition to that. So if you set a stall width of say 850mm then that should be the clear space between partitions. This would make it much easier to ensure compliance with statutory space standards.<br/>
<br/>
If say the left hand partition is deselected, that end stall will have a wider clear space than the adjoining stalls by half the partition thickness. Normally you would want the clear spaces in the stalls to be consistent.<br/>
 <br/>
The stall depth (length?) retains it&#39;s clear dimension irrespective of the partition thickness, which is a very useful implementation but inconsistent with that of the width.<br/>

Perhaps the (because the user cannot assign more than 5 zones to a space) the dialog could be split up in the five zones (see screenshot), zo when the user selects a category in the first zone, only names belonging to that category are selectable in the second popup. And when the user has selected the name of the first zone the second zone becomes available.

<br/>
It would be nice to be able to see what Fonts are being used in a document in the form of a report. If you discover an odd font prior to export, you could either globally change them all to common one - or being made aware of the odd font, you could know to send the font files when you exchange document with someone.<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, it would be terrific to be able to &quot;locate the font&quot; as a contextual right-click in a document, the result of which would highlight all instances of the font.

                Better support of working Remotely and on Virtual Machines
    </p>
</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Of course we talked about this several times already but I don&#39;t think we ever log an enhancement request for it. Here it comes now:<br/>
<br/>
As you also probably realize too working remotely or on virtual machines become more and more important even for smaller offices. Sooner or later it becomes state of the art and it would be better to be prepared for that.<br/>
<br/>
We already have regularly requests about it but at the moment bigger companies or authorities asking for these kind of solutions. But we think that in times of &quot;Working@Home&quot; and more flexible working environments the issue become more important. In the past we already lost some offices and authorities because the performance in the tests were not that good and it seems that ArchiCAD and Allplan can handle it better. Honestly we do not have comparing numbers it is just what us the companies told us. However, we think it&#39;s worth to her these solutions in mind.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Currently this is how the system requirements look:<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
*Remote and Virtual Machines*<br/>
<br/>
We do not consider remote login environments such as Remote Desktop, Terminal Services and VNC or virtual machine environments such as Parallels and VMware to be appropriate for regular work, so Vectorworks performance in these situations is not of primary concern to us. They may be appropriate for administrative testing or utility purposes, and Vectorworks is fully functional in these environments. You should not expect high performance in these environments, however, especially with interactive screen feedback.<br/>
<br/>
We do support Vectorworks running under Boot Camp on Mac machines. As long as you have appropriate and current drivers for the hardware on your machine, you can expect fast and reliable Vectorworks behavior.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
We think in the future all or at least some of these technologies should be supported because they become more popular. The huge benefit is often that you do not need a super high end computer to run Vectorworks @home if you have access to a high end virtual machine.<br/>
Itten Brechbühl is thinking in this direction. They will switch in the near future to such a system and did some performance test. We know that this is the 4th biggest architect office in Switzerland but we know that others also smaller once discuss this. BTW, Itten Brechbühl will also offer this as a service to other companies.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all said I need to mention that I&#39;m not the super expert in these technologies. But I would like to bring that on your radar by adding this enhancement request for future versions.<br/>

<br/>
As an electrician who lays out systems and deals with balancing loads between legs, I would prefer that each consumer tells me with Phase/Leg they are pulling power from. Since we offer a drag and drop interface within the web palette, allowing our users to know which lights are in which leg will allow users to reassign patching as they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Considering we have lighting units that pull from two legs (240V units here in the USA), we need to know which legs are being used.

</td>
                                            <td class="description">      Currently you can only disable shadows for particular objects by creating unique textures for them and setting the shadow options accordingly in the texture settings. This is okay for some scenarios but is typically an extra hassle. For example:<br/>
-Sometimes I&#39;m working with an untextured white model and don&#39;t want to deal with textures at all.<br/>
-Sometimes I have one texture that I&#39;m using across multiple objects, and I need some of those objects to cast shadows and others to not cast shadows, and as it stands you have to make two different textures and keep them cohesive as shader changes are made.<br/>
-Sometimes I want entire container objects to not cast shadows, such as a Symbol of a chandelier that contains many different objects/textures. It&#39;s currently a pain to separately determine shadow settings for each texture that may be used (and sometimes requires also duplicating those textures since they&#39;re used elsewhere with shadows).<br/>
-Switching between textures during the design process means having to track shadow settings across different textures each time you switch.<br/>
-Textures that are assigned via Materials or via parts of PIOs involve another layer of complication.<br/>
<br/>
In general we need the ability to set shadow settings on a per-object basis, which would be much easier. This would be an additional Widget Group in the Render tab of the OIP called &quot;Shadows&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Within that category would be two dropdowns. One would be called &quot;Cast Shadows&quot; with the following options:<br/>
-By Texture<br/>
-Cast Shadows<br/>
-Do Not Cast Shadows<br/>
<br/>
The second dropdown would be called &quot;Receive Shadows&quot; and would have the following options:<br/>
-By Texture<br/>
-Receive Shadows<br/>
-Do Not Receive Shadows<br/>
<br/>
For each dropdown, the &quot;By Texture&quot; option would be default and would match/retain existing functionality. Anyone who doesn&#39;t want to assign shadow settings per-object could collapse the widget group and everything would function as it always has.<br/>
<br/>
The latter two options would supersede any shadow settings coming from the texture(s) for that object, and make the entire object cast or not cast shadows (or receive/not receive). If the object is a container object, it would also override the shadow settings of any sub-objects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that when novice users first want to disable shadows for objects, the first place they tend to think of looking is the Render tab. They assume it would be a per-object setting, not a per-texture settings.<br/>
<br/>
While having the ability to do it per-texture is also useful, we need the ability to quickly and easily do it per-object.

This VE would allow users to nominate a maximum height for the worksheet such that when that height was exceeded, the worksheet data would add additional pager to the right, in a similar way to how Project Revision History Worksheets are set out.<br/>
<br/>
Options would need to include the addition of a header row on each page and also the distance between each page. I am assuming here that this would still just produce a single Worksheet Image object.<br/>

Without the need of manually closing and re-opening the Pre-Installer Dialog. If this checkbox is active, the &quot;start vectorworks&quot; checkbox should be greyed out.<br/>
<br/>
3.2. When finished installing Vectorworks (or the Viewer), a dialog will pop up asking if we want to perform any more actions, if we choose yes then the Pre-Installer Dialog would go back to the start so we can perform any other actions... like installing the Viewer or PSS, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At the end this checkbox or pop-up would appear every time, because the Customer might need to install a myriad of tools that we might have available in the Pre-Installer Dialog: Vectorworks, Viewer, Project Sharing Server, read PDF Tutorials, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Source I don&#39;t really know what am I supposed to select. I have thought about this while creating the German Version Installer for ComputerWorks.

Our current detail markers expect to be fed numbers for proper counting. It would be cool if the drawing coordination could work alphanumerically.<br/>

It would be nice if a worksheet could have a crop. This would allow to show only a part a worksheet on a layout. Examples:<br/>
 * Worksheet of all room areas of one floor layout (without having to create separate worksheets)<br/>
 * Create a print layout with more than one page of a long worksheet<br/>
 * Show a reduced worksheet on one layout without all cells (rows, columns)<br/>

A new option to use the class visibility of a Saved Views as class visibility for a viewport would be a interesting improvement. Benefits:<br/>
 * Control the visibility of a viewport(s) together with the model on the design layers.<br/>
 * High control of viewports about later created classes<br/>
 * Control several Viewport Visibilities at one point<br/>

In most cases this means the planner has to include these joiners in the cable run material counts. <br/>
The new cable tools allow the user to create these joiners and manually add them to the cable parts list but it is slow and time consuming to have to go through each cable run and add the joiners in. <br/>
Having a method of automatically adding this type of joiner would be a good quality of life improvement and help speed up cable planning workflow.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*What&#39;s the current behaviour:* <br/>
<br/>
In the creating dialog of viewports the user have the option to create a viewport with the combination of drawing number and sheet number. Every change to one of the two values (drawing number and sheet number) after the viewport was created has no influence to the name of the viewport. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*Why is the name of a viewport important:*<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to control the visibility of classes of a viewport you can open the organization dialog, go to classes and change the dialog to visibilities. After this change you see how important the name of viewports are.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*What could be the future behaviour:*<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if the name of a viewport could be set. For example:<br/>
<br/>
1. Contraction for the kind of viewport (examples)<br/>
<br/>
-&gt;  a floorpan (Top/Plan View) -&gt; FP<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; a section viewport -&gt; SV<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; a horizontal section -&gt; HS<br/>
<br/>
2. Scale of the viewport<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; 1:50 -&gt; 50<br/>
3. Sheet-Number<br/>
4. Counter<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; This is important for all workflows where a viewport is duplicated<br/>

Most other popular BIM programs have multiple, high-quality rendering options (including Sketchup), and the relative dearth with VW puts our users at a competitive disadvantage. I mention this because I&#39;m encountering this in my own practice.<br/>
<br/>
While Renderworks works well, Redshift has some ways to go before it matches RW, in my view, both in speed and in implemented features.<br/>
<br/>
We have, on the Mac, a link with TwinMotion. TM is strong in animation, entourage and exteriors, but for interior renderings it does not match up--in my view--to Renderworks Styles. Also, the latest versions have removed user access to certain features, such as ambient occlusion, so it&#39;s hard to control the quality of interior renderings. In other respects TwinMotion is a fine program but there are others which would be extremely helpful to incorporate or link to (not the least because they&#39;re powerful and can yield superior results).<br/>
<br/>
V-Ray is very desirable, from my personal viewpoint. Its integration with Sketchup makes it relatively simple and quick to use with that program because of a simplified interface that appears quite intuitive. No reason the same could not be done with Vectorworks.<br/>
Others would include: <br/>
Enscape for the Mac (when it comes out next year)<br/>
Maxwell<br/>
FluidRay (which, I think, is a dark horse, and its relative newness might make them amenable to some kind of deal)<br/>
perhaps Artlantis (which has a link to Archicad).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other programs, such as Sketchup, Archicad and Revit all have several integrated or linked rendering options readily available. Vectorworks Mac users, at this moment, notably only have (aside from RW and Redshift) TwinMotion. Other powerful renderers are out of reach, either because they don&#39;t operate on a Mac, or because they&#39;re not available via VW integration (and few of them have standalone versions). This leaves Mac-based VW users operating at a real and significant disadvantage out in the real world. Hence the reason for this enhancement request.

<br/>
If you have the material information in a custom Vectorworks record format and you “map” this to the material “component 1&quot; it’s not working. Normally the data manager mapping is a kind of override. If you add f.e. the BaseQuantities to the mapping table then the mapped value will be exported.<br/>
<br/>
Would be nice if the Material information would behave the same. If you have defined a Material mapping in data manager this will just &quot;override&quot; the exported pre-defined material of components. If it is empty the component material (Wall, Slab, Roof) will be exported.<br/>

<br/>
VW allows to map a wall component but not a slab component. <br/>
<br/>
Users need to create extrusions and then auto hybrid object but there is another problem: material surface area is correctly calculated only on slab component or on a wall component, and not on extrusion where WV calculate every surface area. <br/>
<br/>
To manage tile area from a slab we need to generate a component to material quantities and then extract an area to creare a NURBS surface to manage the texture.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s why for BIM model we need to have control for texture mapping on a slab components: for texture and quantities<br/>

However, you turn off &quot;Legacy 2D Features&quot; that also include the &quot;Turn off unified view&quot; option as soon as the save view created in 2021 turn &quot;unified view&quot; on.<br/>
<br/>
It means also that &quot;Legacy 2D Features&quot; can be turned off and in the meantime &quot;unified view&quot; is turned off too. The user have to turn &quot;unified view&quot; on by using a saved view.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the future you could turn on &quot;unified view&quot; always but then the saved view created in 2021 should do nothing anymore with that option.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if there are any situation where this could cause troubles.<br/>

<br/>
There should be an option in the tool settings to set the tool default attributes and a checkbox/button in the Mode bar to use the document attributes or Tool Attributes.<br/>
<br/>
This could be useful when annotating drawings at the same time as working on them if you are not using class attributes. You could set the Dimension tools to have a different line color and line weight and have that used as a Tool Attribute while not effecting the attributes you have set for other objects. This could be useful for other types of annotating of drawings also.<br/>
<br/>
See this thread about defaults changing as inspiration for this request.<br/>

From design summit Nov 2021 post-report from [~kchance] :<br/>
<br/>
- There needs to be a smooth transition of bringing the lights into C4D from Vectorworks <br/>
<br/>
 - They need to be brought across with the hierarchy and ‘null’ so you can continue to reposition them straight away in C4D

<br/>
The desired improvement is to allow the direct editing of the criteria - either from-scratch or after being set by the Criteria dialog (similar to the functionality of Worksheets).  This would allow for more intricate criteria settings, such as AND, OR, VAL, etc.
