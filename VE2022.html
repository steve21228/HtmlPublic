<br/>
We&#39;d like an additional setting underÂ 3DÂ Vectorworks Preferences, to control the default projection of plan and elevation views separately from the &#39;isometric&#39; views.<br/>
<br/>
We have had the ability for some time now to control the default 3D View Projection, between Orthographic and Perspective, which is great.Â Â However, as mentioned by Andy in [this thread|https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/101471-change-default-projection-to-perspective-when-orbiting-from-topplan/#comment-444368], if we set this to Perspective then this setting not only applies to &#39;isometric&#39; views but also to the plan and elevation views, which is not desirable. Instead we&#39;d like to be able to set the isometric views to perspective while setting the plan and elevation views to orthographic.<br/>
<br/>
*2. Provide option to have these settings apply regardless of which projection the user is switching from*<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, we&#39;d like an option to have the above settings apply regardless of which projection the user is switching from, instead of only applying when switching from Top/Plan view, as they do now.<br/>

â¢Â CMYK: (0.000,Â 0.000,Â 0.000,Â 0.467) [side note - why is this not 50% gray?]<br/>
<br/>
It would be better if these default swatches matched the nomenclature in the Standard Vectorworks Colors palette:<br/>
<br/>
â¢ White<br/>
<br/>
â¢ Black<br/>
<br/>
â¢ Gray 50%<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise when you choose black or white from Standard Vectorworks Colors, these are brought in to the file as new swatches, so now you have two blacks and two whites, etc. This is messy and annoying.<br/>
<br/>
The blank template should be updated to be consistent with the standard color palette.<br/>
<br/>
(This wish is magnified by the fact that we can&#39;t currently delete and replace swatches in a file, which is a necessary future improvement.)&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps there&#39;s a built in technical limitation causing this, but it would be great if this window appeared more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering - does Vectorworks have to load everything for all 10 categories / panes before the window appears? Could it just load the Sheet Data pane, then load the rest in the background after the window appears? (Not sure how this works, I&#39;m just hypothesizing)<br/>
<br/>
Also, (perhaps this should be a separate VE) it would be nice if Sheet Data fields existed directly in the OIP as well so we could just enter and edit data on the fly more responsively.

<br/>
However, if you change the name of the catalog, it&#39;s impossible to launch the two commands &quot; &quot; Update plant data&quot; or &quot;Update Vectorworks Plantes style&quot;, the message indicates that &quot;*_there were 0 updated in the Vectorworks Plant Database and (..) were not found by searching their Latin names_*&quot;. But if you edit the plant style in the preferences, and choose the catalog, the plant automatically recognizes the latin name.<br/>
<br/>
Many of our customers have a huge library of plant styles, and unfortunately they have this problem of the catalog name being changed and not remembering the old name (or justÂ  they have created a catalog based on a filemaker file). They can&#39;t link the plant styles one by one, because it would be a lot of work. The question is :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;_Is it possible to force a plant style to recognize the new catalog, in order to update the plant styles automatically_Â by latin name ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I tried to use theÂ  data managerÂ &quot;Sourceplantlist&quot; to get the link, or with ODBC, but it doesn&#39;t work, ans it&#39;s very limiting for the customers.Â <br/>

-His catalog (.txt) (EDJ 2022)<br/>

The textures I&#39;m currently looking at are roof textures with &quot;vertical&quot; elements (repeating in the horizontal direction) like Standing Seam, Clay Tile roofs, etc. Â While other textures should also be looked at, the Roof ones are the most critical due to how they&#39;re mapped to Roof and Roof Faces.<br/>

See that attached VWX file to see the issues with one of the standing seam roof textures. Â Other texture need to be evaluated.

This make it incredibly slow to up date label positions if you are working with more than a single hoist, as each label has to be moved separately. <br/>
With the old hoist object the hoist had a set of label coordinates that defined its offset from the hoist. This enabled users to both preset the label offset before insertion of a hoist and to easily update the label offset of existing hoists by either group selecting and entering the offset into the properties or using Spotlight numbering.<br/>
The measurement label does have X Y offset fields.<br/>
<br/>
The old hoist object had label offset controls<br/>
<br/>
The offset value is fairly important for documentation as although you can in theory use a data tag for the label the tag will not be colorized as a result of a Braceworks calculation when displaying the calculation results.<br/>

Below each of the fields, it says at the moment &#39;Mature Spread&#39; and &#39;Mature Height&#39;.<br/>

This is not what you put into these fields. You put in insertion size (i.e. the size of the plant at plantingÂ _or_Â the size used in the design (which is not the same as mature).Â <br/>
<br/>
Mature size is only extra information about the plant, found under the &#39;More data&#39; tab, and has nothing to do with the size you set up your plant style as.<br/>
<br/>
This is most obvious when looking at trees - an oak could have a mature spread of 40m+, but you&#39;d never place the tree at that size in a scheme (it takes hundreds of years for it to grow to that size).<br/>

In section, data tags should prioritize (always reference) objects that are on the section cut plane, not off in the distance somewhere.<br/>

The data tags are a powerful benefit but only if they convey the correct information. If they show the wrong information, well, that is something other than useful.<br/>

In the rescue manager isn&#39;t the dialog for the object style options present. So you can&#39;t edit the primary class of the plant. It would be nice, when you can definet beforehand the object class and also the other insert options. Currently the plant tool uses by the insert the active class.<br/>

- Select the Grade Limits and enable the &quot;Define by Contours&quot; option<br/>

Note that many of the contours are red and show an error in the OIP saying they&#39;re outside the min/max elevations. If you update the Site Model at this point the Grade Limits will be ignored.<br/>

If you reshape one of the Pads slightly so that the edges _don&#39;t_ coincide the problem goes away, so it doesn&#39;t seem like this elevation error should be happening.

If you have a Site Model and place the 2D Contour Labels into their own class via the Settings&gt;Graphics, users are able to make them visible or invisible.<br/>
<br/>
If they are made invisible then the contours have unsightly gaps where the labels once were. This is a cosmetic bug. Surely the labels once made invisible should not make the contours discontinuous? <br/>
<br/>
As the labels are placed by the program the gaps can be cosmetically very unappealing.<br/>
<br/>
Please see the enclosed screenshots.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Constraining all but one axis can be useful especially when working in a non orthogonal view.<br/>
<br/>
I want to manipulate vertices in two directions without the 3rd being changed.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Say you are setting a camera path for a flythrough. You draw the path as a curve and allocate heights for the cameras.<br/>
<br/>
Having previewed the animation you want to edit the path. The desired action would be to go to a top view and just drag a vertex to a new location.Â <br/>
<br/>
Currently you have to juggle backwards and forwards between the X and Y constraints individually, or, with the working plane restraint, drag it to where you want it to be, whereupon it will immediately lose it&#39;s z value and snap to the working plane, and you have to re-enter it&#39;s correct value.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true for the other orthogonal views.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a situation where I would want the program to behave in this way.<br/>

By default, newly created classes in a document are set to be &#39;Invisible&#39; for existing Saved Views and existing Viewports. This can be changed if you create a new class and change the pull down to &#39;Visible&#39;. The Help at the bottom states:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Select a visibility to be assigned, for the new classes, in all existing saved views/viewports. This does not apply to classes that are already in the document&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Logic assumes that from now on any new classes are preset to be visible and they are. Logic also assumes that this setting applies to all new classes introduced into the document. <br/>
<br/>
The bug is that this is not true. If any new classes are introduced into the drawing by bringing in a symbol or an object or a PIO that has new classes attached, then these classes are invisible in existing Saved Views and existing Viewports! There is no way to change this behaviour although users think that having set it up before in the New Class dialogue they should be visible. This defies logic. <br/>
<br/>
The only solution is to tediously change the visibilities of existing Saved Views and existing Viewports in a drawing. Few users know that in the Organisation dialogue the Visibilities button top right allows them to do this editing quickly. Mostly they do it on individual viewports and Saved Views and this can happen many times in a design as new things are introduced. This is a regular complaint about the program being complicated and in this case illogical. Movie enclosed.<br/>

Cheers,<br/>

Being able to sort cells is great in the Cell Visibility and Sorting dialogue. However as the naming (or &quot;Summary Value&quot;) is an incomprehensible list of letters and numbers it is impossible to know what cell is what.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that this Summary Value could relate to something for users, and also that there was a preview button. This preview button would be like the one available in viewports for class and layer visibilities. <br/>
<br/>
At least then users can have an idea about what is what but in the Cell Visibility and Sorting dialogue they are blind. A preview button would be an immense help as one has to go back and forth and it is very tedious.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Previously, you could select a space object and using the double-click option to directly reshape the boundary line. In VW23, data tag will instead be selected if the 2d boundary is off. If you only have a simple square room, you can find the boundary line in the upper right corner even when the 2D boundary is off, but if there are walls all around, this will not work. As the wall for example will be selected instead. The only way to edit the boundary line seems to be if the space object has the 2D boundary line active and even esier if itÂ´s also filled. Compared to how it worked before, when you could quickly double click on a space object and get to the reshape mode of the a boundary line, I find it much harder to reshape the space object quickly now. I would like to see an easy way to flip between the space object/boundary and the data tags for example by hitting tab when one of those obejects are selected.

It&#39;s currently not possible to create Pathway-type modifiers using the &quot;Create objects from shapes&quot; command, though, which presents some limitations.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie and test file show an example of this. The file contains a few open Polygons.<br/>
<br/>
To reproduce:<br/>
<br/>
-Convert one of the polys to a Pathway-type Hardscape using the &quot;Create objects from shapes&quot; command.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this creates a pathway Hardscape as expected.<br/>
<br/>
-Now convert the other poly to a Path-type Site Modifier<br/>
<br/>
Note that it always uses a boundary-type configuration, with no way to treat the input poly as a longitudinal path line.<br/>
<br/>
This means the only way to create pathway-type Site Modifiers is by drawing with the Site Modifier tool itself. This can be difficult because you have to draw the line perfectly; if you make a mistake you&#39;ll either have to start over or manually reshape the path after it&#39;s created (it&#39;s very difficult to keep a consistent width at that point).<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, any closed poly would be treated as the outline for a Boundary-type modifier, and any open poly would be treated as the longitudinal path for a Pathway-type modifier.

3D Objects which are copy/paste in a 3D view becomes a new z-value. The value is taken from the Z-value of the mouse click. This is OK for the values x/y, if you determine the insert point with a mouse click. By the z-value it would by nice the object would keep the z-value from the object.<br/>

The users wish to be able to project to every surface (in 3D) without having the restrictions of the screen already integrated to the Tool. This is very helpful in the workflow, because the planners need to check if something is in the way of the projection. Also the screen could be a fassade of a building. In all this cases, the planner could render the situation and check how it would look.<br/>

The switch to a symbol-based tool, that can project onto any surface and considers the given data of both lenses and projectors, would meet the desires.<br/>

These composed nouns are very frequent in Dutch, and oblige translators to adjust translations for these nouns, which is not always a very elegant solution.<br/>
It would help a lot, if the resource browser could be optimized for this.

<br/>
I see this more as a bug than a VE. But, maybe I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands separators are not working on data tags or any other places, even if the option is configured on system preferences (Os). This is happening on Vectorworks 2022 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Versions before (I can&#39;t be precise on when it was gone), Os units had an impact on Vectorworks units display, especially on areas. Right now it only affects the decimal point. <br/>
<br/>
Now the user is having clarity loss for larger numbers (more than one thousand).<br/>
See the image attached.<br/>
<br/>
The fix can be:<br/>
<br/>
1. Use thousands separators option checked should work for area units and perimeter also. Only works for linear dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
2. Use the Os setting for the symbol used in the OS system preferences. <br/>
<br/>
This should work with area units, perimeters, and volumes, in every part of Vectorworks: <br/>
object info (displays) and reports (data tags, for example)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Effectively this means that there is no way to use a speaker or speaker array with the Electrical components.

<br/>
New tool features:<br/>
<br/>
Allow closure of an open polyline with the Connect/Combine, Fillet or Chamfer command - in addition to checking the closed box in the OIP and getting an odd angle between open endpoints, allow a user to select either mode and settings to close using either tool.<br/>
<br/>
Allow a user to &quot;redo&quot; a Connection, Fillet or Chamfer<br/>
 Currently on a polyline, once a fillet is complete, there is no easy way to adjust the fillet - the two lines that were used to determine the fillet are still present, but I cannot use the fillet command to eliminate the current arc and redo the fillet easily. This seems basic? As long as the lines selected are co-planar eliminate whatever existed previously between them and join the lines at a point (connect/combine), or with a fillet or chamfer. For some reason the polyline is getting in the way of constructing the desired shape, I know this is possible in other software.<br/>
<br/>
New modes to the Fillet:<br/>
 # Trim and Join - join the two lines and Fillet into a single polyline<br/>
 # Fillet with largest radius - use the endpoints and angles of two lines being joined to determine the maximum radius (and join)<br/>
 # Tangent, Tangent, Radius - similar to above, allow selection of two lines and calculate the largest radius available between the two, auto fill that number, but allow user to manually enter a number below that maximum. (and join)<br/>
<br/>
Update Chamfer Mode selection<br/>
 Move Fillet mode selection out of settings and onto mode bar<br/>
<br/>
New Chamfer Mode:<br/>
 # For line length allow setting angle relative to line one, two, absolute.

<br/>
When a user wants to map the DWG layers to Vectorworks classes, the user usually wants to reduce the amount of classes significantly. For example, by mapping all Layers to one or a few Vectorworks classes. At this moment, the interface doesn&#39;t allow to map multiple layers at once, so everything needs to be mapped one by one.<br/>

Doing so will greatly increase customer efficiency as the search time for various settings within files will drop.Â  Frustration due to not quickly finding the needed item will reduce.<br/>
<br/>
Preferences: For example, there are multiple sections within the Vectorworks Prefs, Doc Prefs and Spotlight Prefs.Â  Customers must know which one of the three to navigate to and then they need to find the preference they wish to change. New customers may not even know that there is an option to control a particular preference much less know where to find the preference.Â  By having an option to search prefs included in the QS, customers can quickly type and then be swiftly directed to the appropriate preference.Â  i.e. typing &quot;Off&quot; (offset) which auto-populates with &quot;Offset&quot;, &quot;Roller Chain - Offset Link&quot;,Â &quot;Roller Chain - Offset Link - 3D&quot; and now &quot;Offset Duplications&quot; which can be found in the Edit Section of the Vectorworks Prefs.Â Â <br/>
<br/>
OIP: Rather than customers needing to scroll and scroll and scroll the OIP to find a particular setting, they can use the QS while an object is selected they will be directed to the appropriate place on the OIP.Â  Note the two pics of one OIP attached.Â  It is a lot of info to scroll through.Â  Reducing this time will benefit customers by saving them time and frustration.

<br/>
_sigh_<br/>
<br/>
My read of their reaction is that in a typical working situation, the default contextual hint &quot;icons only&quot; are too vague or mysterious for users to quickly digest and understand if the user is unfamiliar with the feature (which many users still are.)<br/>
<br/>
Once I tell people what those &quot;things&quot; are, how to use them, and how to invoke them, they have typically appreciated the Smart Options Display. However, I can&#39;t be there to tell everyone what they are. I have no doubt that many others are still puzzled or annoyed by them because they don&#39;t know what they are.<br/>
<br/>
But I have thought of a way that I believe will help boost their adoption and use...<br/>
<br/>
Changing the default &quot;Show initial Options as:&quot; from &quot;icons only&quot; to &quot;icons and text&quot; should, I believe, provide the visual cue to let users know what they are seeing and to them either use the S.O.D. or investigate further themselves. By adding the text to the S.O.D pop-up, users will have another cue (their native language) to engage with the feature, try it, and incorporate it into their workflows.Â <br/>

<br/>
It would be great âif it&#39;s not too complex to doâ for this enhancement to be implemented in either 28.0.0 or perhaps in a SP update. The sooner we can get customers using our great Â Smart Options Display, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.<br/>

Very often I want to change a text objects font, size or color without changing it&#39;s alignment or other characteristics.

<br/>
Right now typing an open round bracket after a function gives the user a preview of which parameters need to be used for it to work. The idea here is that the usage of a certain short-key would insert the complete function preview with placeholders. Often the programmer knows which function to use, but don&#39;t know or cannot see the actual variables because those are outside the visible code. But copying a variable (from somewhere else in the code) makes the preview disappear. So, with the preview inserted you can easily scroll up and down and copy paste strings without losing the function preview information and format.

<br/>
 # Export it to a DWG.<br/>
<br/>
It can be confusing for the customer which scale Vectorworks is using to convert this Sheet layer to scale 1:1. Is that scale 1:50 of one of the Viewports or 1:20 of another Viewport<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the Viewport or Section Viewport that is at the bottom of the drawing stacking order is used as a guideline. This is the same behavior when we merge two 2D squares, the one on the bottom determines the color of the new 2D object. So if the first Viewport we put on the Sheet layer is 1:50 the DWG will use this as a guideline to export to this scale 1:1.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if we could influence this in the export. This might be possible via a popup screen so that we can indicate which scale should be used for this. Or that Vectorworks by defaults picks the scaling most commonly used on the Sheet layer.<br/>
<br/>
This is all with the option: Export Viewports as 2D graphics in Model space on.

The objective here is to match theÂ &#39;Title Block Sheet Data.Sheet Number&#39; field with the stacking position. This would support simpler workflows such as Interior Design and Events etc. where a drawing set need only be issued once and the drawing numbers need to reconcile with the PDF page numbers. Auto Coordination needs to be preserved, so the Sheet Number value needs to be used (ie; it&#39;s not sufficient to use the Page Number value).Â

<br/>
This isn&#39;t a huge deal until you start needing to import OBJs from a collaborating vendor multiple times a day. Then it becomes a huge headache, particularly if the imported models are dense meshes, and it takes several minutes to do these steps each and every time.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, having to manually rotate &amp; place the model removes any possibility of importing design iterations and automatically keeping the 0,0,0 origin in the same place upon each import.<br/>
<br/>
For reference, I&#39;ve attached a screengrab of Blender&#39;s OBJ import window which has settings for &quot;Forward&quot; and &quot;Up,&quot; meaning once I&#39;ve set these appropriately I never have to worry about it again. Blender is free, open-source software, and I&#39;d expect Vectorworks to be just as capable with a model format as common as OBJ.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, why is Vectorworks&#39; default &quot;Up&quot; axis for OBJ seemingly different than every single other software that handles OBJ? I&#39;ve never had a single one import in the expected orientation).

would be great, if there was an align and distribute tool for CC devices, to be able to evenly space devices of different sizes vertically and horizontally. (in my case everything is one grid unit (4mm) spaced). Evenly meaning the space from border to boder of each device.<br/>

This lens type, allows the photographer/visualiser to create what would be also be known to illustrators as 2 point perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
It is important to understand that 2d point perspective is not an invented projection (such as Cabinet or Cavalier Oblique)Â  as such - rather, it is a standard real world perspective view, with the following set up:<br/>
<br/>
1) the &#39;camera height&#39; is identical to the &#39;look to height&#39;<br/>
<br/>
2) the image focal point is not in the middle of the view frame, but is &#39;shifted&#39; towards either the the bottom of the view frame or the top of the view frame (depending on whether the view is a ground view shot or a birds eye shot.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
+It should not be underestimated that almost every professional level architectural and interior image or photograph is taken using this setup.+<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
To achieve this set up in Vectorworks in a Design Layer not possible at all.Â <br/>
<br/>
To achieve this set up in Vectorworks in a Sheet Layer is beyond the average user which entails an in depth knowledge of the principle of &#39;shift and tilt&#39; lenses in order to create a long winded workaround that our competitors achieve with the clicking of a checkbox.Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
As a result, the vast majority of 3D perspectives in Vectorworks do not match those of professional photographer OR our competitors. This request therefore calls for a solution which provides a more automated approach to achieving the points 1) + 2) above.<br/>

The option &quot;convert colors to black and white&quot; in the advanced import settings is supposed to mitigate this issue. But in most cases, this option makes the imported drawing even more unreadable, because the fills will be converted to either black or white as well. This usually results black surfaces covering the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, it would be helpful if there were separate options for importing fills and lines, so a user can choose to only import the lies in black, while the fills keep their original color.

Vectorworks is 35 years old and was the first CAD program to have built in reports. Yet in 2022 it is staggering that there is no way to paginate them. Presenting them nicely is crude and very manual and time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
For example I just had a new user create a report of plants with nice images along with other information ready for their client, and the list is long (this is a big project with many species). There is no easy way to do this. They were dumbstruck by this.<br/>
<br/>
It is staggering that they have to crudely and very time consumingly create many cropped viewports in order to do so. It is not the same when printing directly from a worksheet as users want to present them branded with their title blocks etc on a sheet. The discontinued add on &#39;Worksheet on Drawing&#39; could do this 20 years ago along with different colours for rows etc etc!<br/>
<br/>
It is virtually impossible for Spotlight users to present a worksheet with any finesse as they might have hundreds of rows to deal with (and don&#39;t want to buy Lightwright to do it for them).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Peter<br/>

Open a vectorworks file and publish a sheet layer to PDF<br/>

Now print the same sheet layer to PDF ( go to print then save as a pdf )<br/>
<br/>
The two PDFs should be the same paper size. Notice the published PDF sheet has a much larger file size than the printed to PDF sheet<br/>
<br/>
I understand this is due to two different PDF engines being used - one for publish and one for print.<br/>
<br/>
It would be beneficial if publish PDF used the same engine as print, or least produced a smaller file size.<br/>

Large size PDFs are difficult to share and sometimes collaborators cannot even open the files or find them so bulky they can&#39;t use them

<br/>
We use speaker and speaker-array tools every day with more than 100 users. We&#39;ve got many restrictions with those 2 tools, mainly when using with symbols instead catalog mode. Symbols are really important to have correct geometry. Here are our problems with those tools :<br/>
 * Speaker-array tools is unworkable with symbols. When array is populated, then you can&#39;t easily move array, or do anything else, because it seems hat this tools draw new 2D geometry permanently. A solution will be to don&#39;t use 2D and use only 3D when speakers inside array are angled. Like Truss tools. You can have hundreds of truss angled and easy to move<br/>
 * Speaker array files are too much big. Here attached files example. One set with 4 configurations : Speaker-Array-Catalog no populated = 17,1Mo, catalog populated = 17,8Mo, speaker-array symbols no populated = 123,1Mo, symbols populated = 1,79Go (I can&#39;t upload it, too big) !!!!<br/>
 * We need to have our yoke, with correct geometry, and with real insert point. Now, the insert point is systematically at the center of the speaker, but that&#39;s not right in many real speakers. There is usually a Y/Z shift. Real yoke is very important to have corect geometry with scenography, decoration, ...<br/>
 * Same thing, we need to put our correct tripod with real geometry<br/>
 * sometimes we need to have specific shift between speakers in array<br/>
 * When a speaker is used with a yoke, the weight doesn&#39;t change. It will be very important for braceworks calculation when we will able to put our correct yoke with symbol<br/>
 * Speaker-Array tool is limiting global angle to 90Â°. We often use array with more than 90Â°<br/>
 * Many often we have a second bumper in line-array but not the same than the first. Actually the tool is limited to 1 sort of bumper. I have a tip, I duplicated all my bumper and modified them as speakers. So I can insert them between 2 speakers in array (but then limited to 2 sort of speakers instead of 3). We need to have more than one bumper sort in an array.<br/>
 * A tip to have correct yoke is to use speaker-array instead speaker for one speaker+yoke. But then when you angle the speaker, the alignment with the yoke is moving. So that tip isn&#39;t efficient.

<br/>
It is not possible to store a chain hoist in a defined class. This will always be inserted in the active class when used.<br/>
<br/>
This issue causes us additional effort to assign the chain hoists to the right classes manually. Sometimes we have to deal with hundreds of chain hoists.<br/>
<br/>
For the truss symbols there is already a function &quot;Take classes from symbol&quot;. This function is urgently needed for hoists.<br/>
<br/>
For trusses there is already an option in the &quot; Spotlight settings &quot;.<br/>
<br/>

 This is a huge issue for most of our users and represent a massive limitation on the practical use of Braceworks since using pipe like this is standard rigging practice through out the world!<br/>
 Spotlight can draw these configuration but Braceworks won&#39;t calculate them.<br/>

The most recent complaint comes from the Pool Group, a fairly large and high profile German based production company and may cause them to cancel their Braceworks licenses (not sure how many seats)

Seemingly the concern need STEP files with open Solids. no bottom and no top to be able to directly process the file in their software. <br/>
Unfortunately this kind of open Volumes seems not to be supported by Vectorworks. I try to test in some viewers. Then I tried to research with autocad fusion 360, the online Tool. <br/>
What I can see is, that a closed solid from Vectorworks is one object. An open solid addition with surfaces results in several surfaces. The Example File from the concern contains surfaces which are combined to one solid (open Solid)<br/>

1. Possibility to open/import IDS xml in Data Manager<br/>
2. Indication which IFC entity was part of the IDS (was possible in the past already)<br/>
3. Create a Vectorworks data set for each entity with the properties that was included in the IDS<br/>
4. Add custom pSets define in IDS to the correct IFC entity<br/>
5. Create enumeration entries in Data Manager with the allowed values (no more mistakes)<br/>
6. Offer a simple way to only export IFC properties that are part of IDS<br/>
7. Allow import of multiple IDS<br/>

There should be a way to add wall components which are stacked horizontally on top or underneath other wall components. Users struggle with f.e. exterior plinths, because now the plinth needs to be a separate wall. This means that users need to be creative with their wall openings (1 object can just open 1 wall) and plinths (and their openings) need to be moved separately when there&#39;s an adjustment to the design.<br/>

There can be an option to add components horizontally in a wall style.<br/>

Archicad allows you to draw the vertical section of the wall. A visual editor for the wall style could be a potential path. Editing can be done in the drawing space.

<br/>
It would be great if the colors used in Vectorworks were exported to the IFC file more often. We still have to create rules for objects with materials and textures, since many objects are provided with textures after all. But at the minimum it would be great if the colors and color channels of textures were exported.<br/>
<br/>
We think, the following color sources should be considered by the IFC Export:<br/>
 * Color defined in Attribute Palette (incl. color of class if defined &quot;by class&quot;) *-&gt; Currently, the only one supported.*<br/>
 * Color of Sub-Objects (e.g. Color of Component)<br/>
 * Color of texture if the Shader Color has clearly defined colors (e.g. Color, Obj Attribute)<br/>
 * Color of current Data Visualization (Like DWG/DXF Export)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t think it is necessairy to interpret a color from images of textures. In this case, it could ignore the image and only export the color as described above.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, Marc

When you create an elevation drawing with section viewport with a raster rendering (for example &quot;shaded&quot;), it is by default difficult to read the depth in the initial result. To avoid forcing users to draw a lot of semi transparent while polygons in the annotation, it would be nice if there was an automatic way to let the intensity of the raster image fade based on the depth of the objects behind the cut plane<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
create section viewport<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
In the advanced properties of the section viewport, there might be controls to regulate this. See how Revit manages this for their shaded elevation views: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxAW0qdv-TA].<br/>
the focus should be primarily on &quot;shaded&quot; renderings, but it might be nice if it works with Renderworks as well.<br/>
It can be implemented in a consistent way together with this feature request: [SECTION VIEWPORT: line thickness by depth|https://app.asana.com/0/1203207445474911/1203207445474911]

Imagine the bath/shower tool. Baths typically are sized around 70cmx160cm to 90cmx180cm while showers are sized around 70cmx70cm to 120cmx90cm.<br/>
<br/>
If I want the possibility to edit the shower size manually I can&#39;t make the size parameters by style. So when I swap from a bath (80x180) to a shower I&#39;ll get a 80x180 shower... If I would check the &quot;Replace &#39;By Instance&#39; parameters&quot; box, I&#39;d get a shower sized like the default object style size, but I&#39;d be able to change that size by instance.

This would export a CSV that would show all the connection for that device. The use case of this is to represent the connections as a table. I often patch devices like routers/matrices or network switches from a table.<br/>

Alternately, instead of exporting a CSV, it could create a VW worksheet I guess? That might be a more ConnectCAD way of working?<br/>

I have attached a screenshot showing what I think the report would need to have as a CSV export. Let me know what you think!

If I create a 3D viewport of the scene and render that VP in Shaded mode, it is also to blown out. I feel like I I should be allowed to change the Emitter brightness in the Lighting options of that VP, but currently, it does not affect it.<br/>
Likewise, we need overall brightness controls for Shaded mode in design layers.

Making this feature not workable.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Vectorworks could make use of theÂ &#39;&amp;startIndex&#39;Â parameter. See here:Â [https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/430493/how-to-get-all-records-if-wfs-output-limited-to-1000]<br/>

From what I understand most GIS applications use this by default to get around the limitation. That&#39;s properly why it&#39;s not an issue for me to load the same source completely in Qgis. See attachment. Would be nice if VW recognize by itself that the limit has been reached and use theÂ startIndexÂ function to load the remaining data.<br/>

If you apply a data visualisation with fill overwrite &quot;solid&quot;, it doesn&#39;t work on object with the fill type &quot;none&quot;. This is by design, as you can see in Jira issue VB-191247. But the user should have the choice whether overwrite objects without fill/ pen or not.<br/>

In the attached file I have several lighting devices that are patched using breakouts. For lighting devices that use a breakout, the connected power distributor column shows the breakout information but is missing the distributor in which thier upstream fuses are located. <br/>
Even though the fuse column contains breaker or dimmer numbers, when using multiple distributors, we will have multiple copies of the same breaker/dimmer information.

There have been user requests to embed irrigation emitters in the plant styles, which makes sense, particularly for point source irrigation;<br/>

 * [https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/95204-our-current-vw-irrigation-wishlist/#comment-428301] #6.<br/>
<br/>
In discussion with [~bgoff] yesterday, I believe we found an elegant way to accomplish this goal. Rather than worrying about getting irrigation emitters within a Plant Style Symbol. I think adding a tab to the plant style titled something like &quot;Water Use&quot;, &quot;Sustainability&quot; or &quot;Maintenance&quot; could allow us to define a plants maintenance and water needs in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
Looking specifically at water needs, This could be beneficial in several ways. Visualizations could be set to to easily determine if adjacent plant materials had compatible water use. This could also be used to define point source irrigation - in my experience, irrigation directed at a single plant can be accomplished in one of thee ways:<br/>
 # Dedicated bubblers - generally for trees, something like Root Watering SystemsÂ [https://www.rainbird.com/root-watering-system]<br/>
 # Point Source EmittersÂ [https://www.hunterindustries.com/irrigation-product/micro-irrigation/point-source-drip-emitters]<br/>
 # or rings of drip emitter lineÂ [https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pinalcentral.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/db/9dbe68cd-fe63-55d3-875d-e953818d2eab/5e21dc5d5aae2.image.png?resize=400%2C224]<br/>
<br/>
To make this work, the irrigation portion of the new tab would require:<br/>
 # a pull-down on the irrigation tab for &quot;emitter style&quot; (pick one of the 3 above)<br/>
 ## &quot;Emitter Style parameters&quot;<br/>
 # a &quot;Supplimental Irrigation&quot; requirement, (maybe inches/week)<br/>
 # and an &quot;Establishment factor&quot; that would be some multiple of the supplemental Irrigation, generally allowed for the first year or two, depending on Jurisdiction<br/>
 # We would need to the ability to &quot;connect&quot; plant styles not covered in other irrigation - drip areas, or overhead spray directly to laterals or drip lines.<br/>
 # Callout of the emitters could be done with data tags.

It is very inconvenient, because you have to enter its settings separately for each style of plant through the resource manager and select the Laubwerk plant there again.

This request comes from our biggest Customer (Knapp AG), which wants to upgrade several hundreds of users to 2023, but currently that is not be possible due to what is described in this report, hence the emergency to report this as a QRT Bug.<br/>
<br/>
Below is the original e-mail from Knapp AG (translated to english) and attached are the screenshots also sent by Knapp AG:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Since we want to switch from Vectorworks 2019 to Vectorworks 2023, we are now facing the problem that after installing Vectorworks, a Vectorworks account is now required to activate the license. However, since we have to manage several hundred users and licenses across the globe, there will be huge problems rolling out Vectorworks 2023 in our company. Unfortunately, I have to admit that our employees would probably be overwhelmed with that. Most of them will probably break down the door and ask us what they should enter there or why they have to do it all at once? It worked fine without it for years.<br/>
<br/>
By manually setting the &quot;First Time Run&quot; entry in the registry, you can skip the &quot;Sign In&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Nemetschek\Vectorworks 28\Registration<br/>
<br/>
We have a client-server solution for installing Vectorworks. We administrators set on the server which user should have a Vectorworks installed with which license. The client on the user&#39;s computer then automatically downloads the installer and installs VW in silent mode. In the course of this, we would then run a script at the end of the installation, which then makes the entry in the registry.<br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, this entry is only related to the user (HKEY_CURRENT_USER). In this way we would only prevent the account requirement for the user who carried out the installation. But if someone else then logs on to the computer and starts the VW, there is of course no registry entry for the current user and the sign-in dialog appears again.<br/>
 <br/>
While this won&#39;t happen often on users&#39; laptops, we also use Vectorworks a lot remotely.<br/>
We have over 10 terminal servers (+ graphics card) where Vectorworks is installed. The users do not always get on the same server, but are automatically redirected to the individual servers depending on the load. The Vectorworks is started directly. More than 100 users work with it every day. That would mean that in the initial phase they would have to register with an account on every server at some point.<br/>
<br/>
What Knapp AG needs is that the &quot;First Time Run&quot; key is not defined for the user, but that it can also be defined globally for the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why I wish it were possible to relate the entry &quot;First Time Run&quot; to the computer and not to the user. I tried making the entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. However, it had no effect. Vectorworks probably only looks at HKEY_CURRENT_USER for this.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Nemetschek\Vectorworks 28\Registration<br/>
<br/>
If this were possible, all our problems would be solved. We would then manually set the entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE during installation on the server. Any user who then starts a remote Vectorworks would then not notice anything about this account requirement and can work as normal as with previous versions. We wouldn&#39;t have to do any extra work with regard to accounts either.&quot;<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      Currently, when you recalculate a worksheet, you are presented with two options; Recalculate Active Worksheet, and Recalculate All Worksheets. In VW 2023, these two options appear inside the Worksheet Editor, in the Object Contextual Menu you are presented with Recalculate Selected Worksheet, and Recalculate All Worksheets, which are essentially the exact same choices.<br/>
<br/>
In VW 2022 and older, the Object Contextual Menu only gives you Recalculate, which performs a Recalculate All Worksheets action.<br/>
<br/>
Because worksheet criteria can hinge on the Selection State of objects, recalculating ALL worksheets can cause corruption of data when the Selection State changes. To prevent this, it would be a great feature to be able to LOCK a WS when all editing is done. This would prevent inadvertent updating when none is desired.<br/>
<br/>
If a drawing has changed significantly, the user would have complete control to LOCK or UNLOCK Worksheets and force recalculations later. Menu items could also be added to LOCK ALL or UNLOCK ALL Worksheets as a convenience to worksheet maintenance.Â <br/>
<br/>
I can think of a few more subtle issues, but they can be discussed at a later date.

However Truss and other rigging objects seem to use a hidden line rendering mode for their schematic view objects. This drastically increases the complexity of the geometry for Schematic View Rigging Objects and results in frustrating delays when updating Schematic View Objects.Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The suggested enhancement would be to have Schematic Views of Truss use the 2D Components of the Truss Symbols based on the view of the Schematic View Object instead of a Hidden Line Rendering. It would also be great to have Schematic Views recognize geometry contained within Hanging Position Objects and utilize 2D Components of contained Truss and other symbols in a similar fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
These enhancements would be an effective way to optimize the Schematic View workflow using existing features in VWX.Â

On the rigging plots, not the electrical layout paperwork, the head rigger adds the hoist number and the cable length to the paperwork. This allows the local crew to pull a hoist and the specified cable from the gear area and bring them both out to the proper location on the truss. The crew member then places the hoist, connects the cable.<br/>
<br/>
Since the plan is to have the Cable &amp; Power Planning layout tools specify the needed cables, this cable length field should be filled in by the C&amp;PP tool. However, this field should be user-editable to allow riggers who are not using power planning to add their needed cable lengths.<br/>

Adding a menu option to the worksheet&#39;s file menu of &quot;Find in Drawing&quot; would likely be an often-used option. Alternatively, having an &quot;Activate Layer&quot; would also solve the problem.<br/>

Additionally, when browsing worksheets in the resource manager it would be equally useful to have a &quot;Locate in Drawing&quot; function. Perhaps added to the right-click menu.<br/>

Now I was wondering why the Renderworks texturesÂ from the 3D Image Props Photorealistic are not used in the 3D Graphics of the corresponding Plant styles:<br/>
For example: Acer campestre - the texture existsÂ but is not used in the Plant styles (it contains Rhus typhina)<br/>
Â <br/>
Maybe the library with the Species Specific plants could use a double check - which Image Props can be updated with the PhotorealisticÂ textures<br/>
(in line with this finding I also made a bug report:Â https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-190415)

                                            <td class="description">      Here is how the Plant currently works:<br/>
When a Plant is created over a Site Model or a Plant over a Site Model is recalculated, the plants (each of its plant symbols) are automatically sent to the Site Model surface. I.e. internally, during the recalculation of the Plant, the plant symbols will automatically conform (adjust elevations) to the Site Model surface and it is done whenever the Plant is above a Site Model.<br/>
<br/>
Note that *there is no option to control this behavior - the plant symbols always conform to the first found Site Model* (over the Plant area).<br/>
<br/>
Calling the Send to Surface command for a Plant object only triggers object recalculation, thus, it only ensures that the plant symbols conform to the Site Model surface (for example, in cases when Plant position or Site Model position have changed).<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to *allow &quot;disconnecting&quot; the Plant object from sending (of its plant symbols) to the surface and along with it their current elevations to be &quot;locked&quot;*, i.e. the next recalculation to not make the plants elevations zeros but to keep them as if they are still adjusting to the surface as it was at the time of locking.

Thus the ability to save specific settings in a &quot;Style Manager&quot; such as in the site model dialog or Data Viz dialog. These could then be applied presetting the choices for the user offering a better user experience.

For the Slope Values Vectorworks gives the option to define the display prescision independendly to the document settings. The &quot;same&quot; option would be nice for the Height of Drainages.<br/>

- Texture defined by object<br/>
<br/>
- Texture defined by the components<br/>

<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/97724-persistent-none-class/]<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Light objects can&#39;t have their fill set to anything except &quot;Solid&quot; which is good because nothing else would make sense for a Light (in fact I wish the Fill dropdown were disabled entirely).<br/>
<br/>
However, Heliodons are not limited in this way and can be set to any type of Fill in the Attributes Palette. This fill affects both the 2D label text AND the Heliodon&#39;s internal light. This is confusing and could be improved.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, for example, if you want the label to have a blue background fill, it also makes the internal Light emit blue light. Or if you want the Heliodon&#39;s Light output to be a sunset orange, you also end up with an orange label.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, if you set the fill to None, the internal Light still retains the fill color, which is what confusingly happened in Michal&#39;s in the thread linked above (which was further complicated but the use ofÂ &quot;By Class&quot; attributes).<br/>
<br/>
Since Heliodon&#39;s are a special type of Light, their Fill settings should behave the same as regular Lights (always be a Solid Color). And since the 2D Heliodon representation is ALREADY symbol-based, the attributes of the text should just come from the text object in the Heliodon Symbol.

<br/>
A similar behavior is required for the Hardscape. However, due to the fact that Hardscape has borders (curbs) where the bottom of their lowest components might not follow the bottom of the main area lowest component, we decided that the cut&amp;fill surface should comply with the main area lowest component:<br/>
 !hardscape-cut&amp;fill-3.jpg|thumbnail! <br/>
<br/>
Note that the Hardscape can behave as a modifier (unlike the Landscape Area, which conforms to the Site Model surface).<br/>
For this reason, a choice between 3 options will be added:<br/>
- Acts as modifier<br/>
- Conforms to site model and cuts volume for subsurface components<br/>
- Acts as modifier and cuts volume for subsurface components<br/>
<br/>
When cutting volume for its subsurface components (when applied on the Site Model), the cut&amp;fill surface will follow the same rule as shown on the above picture.

<br/>
The slab drainage&#39;s geometry is defined by using the Slab Drainage Tool in the Building Shell Tool set. Drainage points are inserted which provide custom slopes and result in arbitrary geometry for the slab drainage.<br/>
<br/>
The geometry of the pad modifier, aligned modifier or the path modifier which is applied to the site model is not influenced by the drainage geometry and can be different. This can be seen in files &#39;slab drainage aligned.vwx&#39; and &#39;slab drainage path.vwx&#39;. Therefore, when 3D Type is Slab Drainage, the Use site modifier option should be disabled. Instead, a new check option should be added for the slab drainage which would allow it to provide its geometry as modifier for the site model.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the slab drainage geometry is calculated in the functionÂ DrawSlabDrainage in Hardscape/Utilities.cpp. The main area geometry is stored inside a Slab parametric object inside the First list of the hardscape. It contains Slab nodes for flat components and CSG Tree nodes for components which have arbitrary geometry.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that the slab drainage can have tapered components as it can be seen in &#39;slab drainage tapered.png&#39;. Also it should be noted that the hardscape border does not work well with slab drainage when the surface is not flat as it can be seen in &#39;slab drainage border.png&#39;.

<br/>
In Australia there is a statutory requirement for all swimming pools to be enclosed with a compliant pool fence. This often results in fences following the natural and sloping topography. It is also quite common for the same pool fences to have curved sections between the posts. Can the Railing/Fence tool be enhanced to support this please.Â

Today, this is a totally manual process if you want to do it in Vectorworks, and hence many practices are moving this to different software.<br/>

Â <br/>

A user could set this up similarly to the slope analysis - specifying the number of bands, the intervals, and what colors to associate with them.<br/>
<br/>
It would also be useful to have an automated key, similar to how the DataViz is showing applied attributes.<br/>

It would also be good to have the same effect as 3D graphics. This would help for the analysis stage for large sites.<br/>

The Railing / Fence Tool is a very easy tool to quickly draw the fence of a plot. Especially when dealing with large distances. Using separate symbols for this is much more work.<br/>
<br/>
However, this tool has some limitations in the parameters, so you cannot create everything, including common fences.<br/>
The picture shows an example of such a case There are still several variations to make in terms of plank width. But the main thing is that you can build the fence in 3 layers.<br/>
Front, back and the layer in between to connect them. Both in horizontal and / or vertical.

Drawing a Railing/Fence(3D Line Mode) in Top/Plan view does not automatically put the Railing/Fence on the Site model. To do so one needs to use the command Send to Surface. This gives the whole object one Z-value. This is different behavior then when drawing the Railing/Fence(3D Line Mode) in a 3D View where parameters Height point 1 and 2 snap to the height of the Site Model.<br/>
Now one has to first set a Stake at both endpoint to know the height, try to remember what was point 1 and 2 (as the direction of the path lost), adjust Height point 1 and 2 in the OIP according to the stakes AND remove the Z value.<br/>

Send to surface of a Railing/Fence: 3D Line Mode sends Height point 1 and 2 to surface

Currently, we can have different parts placed on a terrain model (DTM).<br/>
1. Because the tool itself can do this, e.g. Existing tree tool.<br/>
2. By allowing an object to connect to the underlying terrain model via the Sent to Serface command (3D polygon).<br/>
<br/>
The Railing/Fence Tool gives the user a comprehensive ability to model and parametrically modify fences without making the model very heavy. It is useful in 2D because you can draw it as a Polyline. This extended option does not exist for drawing in 3D. Here you can only draw a 3D line option.<br/>
<br/>
By being able to draw the Railing/Fence in 2D plan and then place it on the terrain model via the Sent to Surface command. Would be a great improvement and addition.<br/>
The option to replace 3D line with 3D Polygon would also give the user more freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it should be possible to deform and move the Railing/Fence in 3D with the Reshape Tool. In a similar way as you can do a NURBS. Fixing an axis such as the Z axis. Add and remove control points.

If you draw a hardscape in an empty document, the 2D fill is set by a dedicated class by default. This duality is unnecessary complicated for simple drawings and confusing to beginning users. The 2D fill should have the object&#39;s class (&lt;hardscape&gt;) by default. This would be in line with other tools in Vectorworks.

                                            <td class="description">      Further to my earlier Enhancement Request, VE-103576:<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Vectorworks does not have the ability for an object&#39;s layer to change while ensuring its Z position is retained. If the layers have different Z origins, most objects will move their Z position when moved to another layer. Examples object are the +roof object+ and +aligned hardscape+Â with internal Surface Modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it is desirable to changes an object&#39;s layer. In most cases, the *+hard fought for+* Z location should not change but it will. The Z location will change by the distance between the two layers&#39; Z origins.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs a &quot;Lock Position&quot; function. Currently, we have the &quot;Lock&quot; function. It retains an object&#39;s X,Y,Z position but also locks all other aspects of of an object, including its layer. The layer of a locked object cannot be changed.<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;Lock Position&quot; function would retain the object&#39;s X,Y,Z position while allowing the other characteristics of an object to be changed, including its layer. This would allow an object to be moved to another layer, retain its Z value and, importantly, its constraints with other objects.<br/>
<br/>
For users who work in 3D there are many challenges and many, many rewards. In my opinion, working in 3D is the best workflow. This one inability of Vectorworks unnecessarily frustrates the user&#39;s 3D workflow. It is, so seemingly, easy to remedy.<br/>
<br/>
The current workaround of group / ungroup on the active, target layer works to retain the object&#39;s Z location but is cumbersome and threatens an object&#39;s constraints with other objects.Â <br/>
<br/>
Kindly develop a &quot;Lock Position&quot; or similar functionality in Vectorworks.

<br/>
The current effort at Vectorworks, Inc is to move toward using Data Tags for all labelling/data display needs, but I don&#39;t see or hear any indication that supporting images in Data Tags is on the road map.Â <br/>
<br/>
I suggest that either the scope of the statement in Vectorworks Help manual needs to be reeled in, or adding support for images to Data Tags should be added to the road map.Â <br/>
<br/>
This finding came about when I was helping a user get around a problem with the Plant Tool&#39;s plant tags, so I&#39;d like to hear back about this in case it changes the advice I give them or other users.Â <br/>

<br/>
When the Space has its &quot;Show 2D Boundary&quot; option OFF then we have added a 2D Locus to help but that&#39;s not enough.<br/>
When we designed the Space label to Data Tag task (T02240) we missed that the Space label was the thing users were clicking on to select the Space. So now they still click on the label, selecting the Data Tag. Then they move to the OIP in order to change some Space settings just to realize it&#39;s a Data Tag object. Having here a button to select the Space would save them from some frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Another option could be to have a command in the context menu of the Data Tag like &quot;Select linked object&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Having both solutions would be great.

Parking space should consider the car length in case the spaces are angled. In that case a car would be partially on the street.<br/>

<br/>
Multi-lining in worksheet formula fields should work and be preserved even after being parsed. Otherwise the option to expand the formula field does not serve much of a purpose. (see Figure 2 on page 4: screenshot attached)<br/>
<br/>
See also:<br/>
T02175: Multi-lining doesn&#39;t work in worksheet formula field<br/>
<br/>
Target should have been 2023, but this is no longer possible, so I vote for 2024 at the latest. Solving this would also make multi-lining possible in the expert formula field in the data manager, where formulas can get quite extensive and overwhelming. Multi-lining would help much in this regard to get a much clearer picture of what is happening in the formula.

As you can see in the video, you need to make a specific class for the 2D boundary in order to be able to unlink the fill and line (and text) opacity. This is a too strict workflow for most users. It would be easier if you could just manage the fill and line opacity separately in the attributes palette and Space graphics settings.

For simple projects, however, not much is missing and we could create a great added value from the existing tools. The basic idea is that you no longer have to create a layout to show details but that from viewing the 3D model can eliminate uncertainty, but also no big additional effort for the preparation of the 3D model should be needed. From this the following wishes can be derived:<br/>
 # Labeling objects like Data Tags, Dimensions and Texts should be visible in the 3D model. These should also be able to be displayed when the textures of the objects are set to gray. Here also a simple control to switch them on or off would be useful. (something like: Show Labels, Show Dimensions). See Label and Dimensions.png. For simplicity&#39;s sake, all objects that are drawn with the tools in the Dims/Notes tool set could be useful in the 3D model too...<br/>
 # Representation grey in the 3D model should optionally be shown with edges for better readability<br/>
 # Grey representation in the 3D model where objects touch each other, this should be optionally, visually highlighted<br/>
 # Exploded View: The model should be able to be pulled apart in the individual axes in the same way as an exploded view. This is especially interesting for furniture drawings.<br/>
 # The transparency of the representation grey of a layer should be controllable.<br/>

<br/>
greetings.<br/>
<br/>
Attached, you find a screencast from Sketchup.<br/>
<br/>
I show a feature/function which is really helpful to check your drawing<br/>
accuracy relative to the current active axis.<br/>
<br/>
In Sketchup, you can temporarily overwrite the colors of all lines<br/>
with the color of the current axis.<br/>
<br/>
The lines get the color only, if they orientate 100%<br/>
in the direction of the axis.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your drawings really fast with this feature.<br/>
This is also be very helpful with DWG/DXF imports with<br/>
a lot of lines, polygons, â¦Â <br/>
<br/>
I used this feature/function very often in Sketchup.Â <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lines in x-axis-direction will be overwritten with red<br/>
Lines in y-axis-direction will be overwritten with green<br/>
Lines in z-axis-direction will be overwritten with blue<br/>
<br/>
/ / /Â <br/>
<br/>
I have tried to replicate this with data visualization,<br/>
but this cannot currently be achieved with data visualization.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, with Data Vis, you can achieve a color<br/>
overwrite only for 2D lines and only for x and y.<br/>
No other geometry (Nurbs, polygons, â¦) will be affected<br/>
and no color for any Z-direction.Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
So one solution could be, to enhance Data Visualization,<br/>
but it would like to see this function as option (icon) in the Mode Bar<br/>
(or is it called Option Bar) on the top right side, to easy and fast turn it<br/>
on or off.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Currently, we don&#39;t have any options to check your drawings,<br/>
in this way. I would find this very, very useful.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Greetings and Merry Xmas<br/>

<br/>
By adding a &quot;width&quot; parameter in the local mapping pop over, this could be done way more intuitively.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if the &quot;width&quot; and &quot;length&quot; parameters could be unlinked, it would be possible to scale a complex line type only in one dimension. See the attached video for an example where this could be useful.<br/>

DEMs are created from a variety of sources.Â USGS DEMsÂ used to be derived primarily from topographic maps.&quot;_<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The ability to import and export DEM files is a heavily requested feature that dates back to 2008, possibly earlier (see below for requests on the forum).<br/>
<br/>
I would see this being available for Landmark and potentially Architect. The workflow would be to go to either File&gt;Import&gt;Import DEM or Landmark&gt;Survey Import&gt;DEM. Commands could be added to the DEM object to allow:<br/>
 * extraction of contours and/or points (xyz)âspecified by unit (i.e. 10ft contours). Use this as source data to create a site model.<br/>
 * or automatically convert DEM to site model<br/>
<br/>
The existing Site Model could have an added option:<br/>
 * 2D Display: DEM (Digital Elevation Model)<br/>
<br/>
This could be exported as a DEM and then used for programs like arcGIS, Lumion, Twinmotion, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
At present, users typically have to use a different application like QGIS or Blender to import DEM files, extract objects, then bring into Vectorworks. In the video I recorded, I show the process for importing a DEM into QGIS&gt; extract contours&gt; export shapefile&gt; import shapefile into Vectorworks&gt; Modifiy by record (elevate 2D poly)&gt; create site model from source data.<br/>

If there was a checkbox &quot;create drawing label&quot; in the OIP, there would be a fast and easy to find way to delete the drawing label, just by checking off this box.

<br/>
in some software I use, it is possible to activate âCenter Mode&quot; temporaryÂ <br/>
by pressing Option (Mac) or ALT (Win).<br/>
<br/>
We do have temporary modes in VW â¦<br/>
<br/>
Rectangle Tool (with Mac)<br/>
SHIFT = square<br/>
SHIFT + CMD = rectangle with &quot;Golden Ratio&quot;<br/>
<br/>
â¦ but there is room for more.<br/>
<br/>
The OPTION or ALT key cannot be used, while the user is in drawing mode<br/>
with Rectangle or Line Tool.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest: âCenter Modeâ for an extra mode.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
Rectangle and Lines<br/>
Both tools have an extra but permanent &quot;Center Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This solution is okay, but not so âdrawing-friendlyâ as a temporary mode<br/>
with OPTION or ALT, because a temporary mode is way faster, specially<br/>
for the Rectangle Tool.<br/>
<br/>
â¦ AND you always have to press the same key to activate a &quot;Center Mode&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rectangle: method change to &quot;Center Mode&quot; = U key<br/>
Line: method change to &quot;Center Mode&quot; = I key<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Â Maybe other tools could benefit from OPTION or ALT too.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Germany and wish you all Merry Christmas<br/>
Tobi

<br/>
Tabs should only shrink and truncate the filename if they absolutely have to because there are too many tabs open to fit them all with full filenames on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
And in the less common case when they do have to be truncated like this, I should be able to get on OnHover tooltip of the full filename if I have on the tab.<br/>

I am not sure is this same behavior is present in non-mode-bar releases.Â

<br/>
_Good morning,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d like to submit a feature request to Vectorworks, or seek a solution if this is something already possible in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
When placing callouts in the sheet layers, viewport annotations it&#39;s possible to use a user-defined font formatting style. When this is placed as a keynote, options for setting the fonts isn&#39;t available which means every keynote needs to be formatted individually between new projects. <br/>
<br/>
Our initial workaround for this is to copy and paste the formatted keynote between sheets, but this isn&#39;t an ideal way of working as it&#39;s not built in to the template we&#39;ve developed in the office.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as projects develop and we change the drawings/viewport scales from 1:100 to 1:25, the annotation styles don&#39;t scale. It would be good if we were able to set this to automatically scale, or have an option to quickly update fonts to a larger scale to suit the drawing scales._<br/>
<br/>
Is this something already available in Vectorworks?

Basically: I think confusion arises around what &quot;structural objects&quot; are, as defined for the purpose of section viewports and the various options in the &quot;Advanced Section Properties&quot; dialogue. But this wishlist item goes a little further I think. I am going to try and keep this concise to start with, partly to stop it being too confusing, partly because I&#39;m running out of time to write this just now.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s that dialogue box:<br/>

I have attached a VWX file with this post. It&#39;ll probably be necessary to open it and look at it in order for this post to make any sense. Screenshots are taken from it. The array of possible section viewports looks like this:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each of those section viewports is a section through this hypothetical wall/roof buildup:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a standard cavity wall here in the UK, brick outer skin (not loadbearing), insulation in cavity, block inner skin (loadbearing). I&#39;ve modelled a kind of decorative brickwork corbel at the top of the brick. The roof is structural timber joists, plywood deck on top, insulation &amp; membrane above. Plasterboard ceiling fixed to bottom of joists. Decorative coving at junction of wall and roof, internally. What I&#39;ve drawn is just illustrative for the purposes of this wishlist post.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Most of my section drawings (in practice) are either<br/>
<br/>
- something like *section type B* where I want to show some level of internal buildup detail, and where the scale is 1:50 or larger. In these examples I&#39;ve shown material fills as solid colour, but in reality I would usually be using hatches instead.<br/>
<br/>
- something like *section type E* where I don&#39;t want to show buildup detail. Anything smaller than 1:50 will usually be like this. Sometimes I might use it up to 1:50 for early stage drawings.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Points to make:<br/>
<br/>
Note the difference between *section types A and B:*<br/>
<br/>
[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1497986009_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_05_45.jpg.9e98a5828ed576b8a84db058ead9e938.jpg|width=868!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_12/1497986009_Screenshot2022-12-19at23_05_45.jpg.9e98a5828ed576b8a84db058ead9e938.jpg]<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
On *section type B* the brick corbel detail is &quot;merged&quot; with the brick component of the wall. I&#39;m more likely to want this, than the lines shown in *section type A.* I&#39;ve achieved this by telling VW that those extrudes I used to model the corbel courses are &quot;structural objects&quot; because this allows it to merge them with the &quot;structural object&quot; that is the wall. But of course, those corbels aren&#39;t in reality &quot;structural objects&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
What are/aren&#39;t defined as &quot;structural objects&quot; for this purpose doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Either VW has got some wacky ideas about what&#39;s structural (ie holding the building up), or that&#39;s just a bad name for that type of object, or there needs to be some additional method(s) of choosing what to merge in sections.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Below, *section type F* on the left shows what VW thinks is and isn&#39;t structural. *Section type G* on the right shows what I think is and isn&#39;t structural.<br/>

Then we come to what the &quot;profile line&quot; is. I actually haven&#39;t really used this in real life. I&#39;d assumed it was the outer profile of the whole section...but it seems it&#39;s not. A complication is that it doesn&#39;t seem to work in VW2023 SP2. So... here&#39;s a screenshot from VW2021 to show where it is drawn (as the red line) in *section type C :*<br/>
<br/>

But in *section type D* I indicate (by using stacked viewports) where I think a &quot;profile line&quot; should be and would be useful, and, I think, fits with a fairly standard drawing convention where the overall section cut line is drawn with a thick line (I&#39;ve just shown it in red for emphasis) and then the internal detail (also in section) is drawn with a thinner line:<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m going to leave it at that for now, no doubt multiple subsidiary questions will come up in discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I do think the way that sections are drawn (and the amount of fine control given to the user) is really crucial in allowing us to create good, clear documentation from the model with as little touching-up in annotation space as possible.<br/>

This is great on Design Layers, but it&#39;s not super useful for Sheet Layers to always see &quot;Top/Plan&quot; for the View. Views aren&#39;t really a relevant thing when on Sheet Layers,Â but what&#39;s currently missing is the Sheet Name which WOULD be relevant and useful.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached screengrab, forÂ example, the two right hand panes are currently labeled:<br/>
 * Top/Plan 01<br/>
 * Top/Plan 07<br/>

What would be MORE useful would be:<br/>
 * Plan &amp; Elevations 01<br/>

<br/>
Even BETTER would be:<br/>
 * 01 [Plan &amp; Elevations]<br/>
 * 07 [Desk Details]<br/>

because this matches how users &#39;think&#39; about sheets, and would also match the Syntax from the Layer dropdown.

Task T02371 is doing something similar for IFC fields, I beleive it would be useful to create the ability to ignore data silos and access specific field data for fields of the same name, in areas outside IFC.

This is useful because it is quite typical for Reed Hilderbrand to have 50-80 references in a Vectorworks files of images, pdfs, vectorworks files, dwgs all referenced into their main file. If they can simply right-click and select &quot;Go to reference&quot; and it selects the object in their file it&#39;ll make it much easier to locate objects. Similar to force selecting an object that you don&#39;t know which design layer or class it resides on.

Sometimes for a VP, one will add a new layer or class to satisfy a particular need but never are these additions tracked across the multiple Saved View scripts.

Start with DWG Reference A. Right Click &gt; Edit. Browse to path of new file<br/>
Click OK at the &#39;Edit Reference&#39; pop up with path to new Source File DWG B<br/>
References list shows DWG B and &#39;up to date&#39; even though the content displayed is DWG A (a bit confusing, but nevermind)<br/>
Right Click Reference in list &gt; Update. Accept the import processing pop up<br/>
The content disappears, because the new Design Layer has been created and is invisible<br/>
To fix this, either zoom in on the file origin and select the invisible little 100x100mm breadcrumb, or navigate to the Viewports tab in Navigation and Edit or Activate the Reference viewport (which is still named with DWG B)<br/>
Select Layers. Turn on the Design Layer for the new DWG.<br/>
It works, but I&#39;m not looking forward to teaching it to the rest of the office...!<br/>

Editing a DWG reference could do with a prompt to say &#39;this operation will create a new Design Layer in the Reference viewport for the replacement file. Do you want to enable visibility for the new Design Layer?&#39;

The problem is, no matter what you do, the base and capital will not pick up any assigned line attributes. See the image below. The lines are very thin, almost invisible and not indicative of a footing or column shaft. If I assign the footing class to the base through the classes/materials... button, the base should change its appearance accordingly.<br/>
Currently, I need to add a 2D rectangle with the footing line attributes for the footing to be visible.<br/>

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consistency&quot; (and lack there-of) is one of the biggest complaints I hear about Vectorworks. A user expects similar results in similar contexts, but when actions yield _different_ results in similar contexts, it&#39;s aggravating, slows down the drawing process, and leads to errors.<br/>
<br/>
One inconsistency that currently exists is in regards to editing TEXT, wherein keyboard actions produce different results in various contexts. For example, when editing a Text object, you have to hit &quot;Esc&quot; to commit the text (since &quot;x&quot; obviously just types the character x), but hitting &quot;Esc&quot; _normally_ means to cancel the current operation, not commit it. This is confusing â I&#39;ve seen new users get tripped up on this, and it still trips me up after 15 years of using Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
And then other modifier keys lead to inconsistent results in other contexts.Â To illustrate what I&#39;m talking about, I made a chart of the &quot;current&quot; situation, outlining various contexts (rows) versus what happens when you hit certain keys (columns). Similar results are color-coded. Note how the colors in the top chart are patchy. On the bottom is a suggestion of reconfiguring things to be more consistent â note how the colors are blocked together, indicating consistency.<br/>
<br/>
!TextEditing.png|width=373,height=348!<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest changes I&#39;m suggesting is that hitting &quot;Enter&quot; should always commit the text (which addresses the issue I described earlier). Accordingly, that means a user will have to hit Shift+Enter to return to the next line. There are many websites and software these days that work like this (typing into iMessage on a Mac, to name one), so I&#39;m sure folks would quickly adapt to the change. This would also be a great opportunity to use contextual tooltips (like at the bottom of the screen) to nudge the user: &quot;Text Tool Â *1* Â Hit Enter to commit text. Hit Shift+Enter to go to next line. Hit Esc to cancel.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A change like this would not only make text-based interactions more consistent, but it would also speed up users&#39; workflow. For example, when editing a Callout, a user can simply hit Enter when finished, instead of having to move the cursor to the OK button [since the Fn+Enter hotkey isn&#39;t common knowledge].<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
This topic is particular relevant to experienced users who start to develop muscle memory, because as it stands that muscle memory delivers inconsistent results in situations that all feel like they should match. Every time I switch between the different contexts outlined above it pulls me out of my flow state, so I&#39;d love to see this given some thought for future versions. Thanks!

Something like a Menu option under the Vectorworks/Help Menus (mac/windows)<br/>

Or a button on the home screen that just looks for that file name in the user folder and opens the file in the default text editor? Or make the file an XML/HTML and open it in the default system web browser?Â

                                            <td class="description">      Sometimes we use Vectorworks to âpresentâ a design to someone, whether it be a colleague, boss, head designer, design team, a group on Zoom, etc. When presenting, weâre mainly just navigating our working file, pointing out things with the cursor, discussing elements, maybe selecting objects to see OIP properties, etc. But weâre not âworkingâ or doing any heavy editing. So the problem is that thereâs potentially a lot of distracting gak on the screen that isnât needed in a presentational context, and which sometimes pulls attention away from the focus of discussing the design. Itâd be great to be able to quickly switch to a temporary âPresentation Modeâ whenever you know youâre only going to be using Vectorworks in this simplified way while others are watching.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
I suggest that under the Window menu there could be a new option to toggle âPresentation Modeâ which would automatically turn on and off certain existing settings with one quick command. This would be customizable, so there would need to be a place to set up which settings you want to be affected. Under Presentation Mode Settings there would be checkboxes for the following:<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Suppress all auto save pop-ups.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ If using full-screen cursor, switch to simple pointer cursor.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Hide Light glyphs, green constraints, red unlinked indicators, loci, and other various glyphs.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Hide red viewport âout-of-dateâ borders.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Turn off snap indicators, smart cursor cues, acquisition hints, red smart points, etc.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Turn off pre-selection highlighting and other highlighting, keeping only selection highlighting.Â <br/>
<br/>
â Turn off &quot;UseÂ Sound&quot;<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Suspend snapping<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Hide enabled palettes (that is, the setting that already exists in Window menu).<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Disable Smart Options Displayâs idle trigger.<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Switch Floating Data Bar to be only show on Tab (if not already).<br/>
<br/>
âÂ Deselect all objects across all Layers (for example, when youâre flipping through Sheet Layers there wouldnât be viewports already highlighted from previous work.)<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Upon engaging Presentation mode, all of the checked items would be affected. Upon disengaging Presentation mode, settings would return to the same as they were before (I suppose with the exception of object selection state).<br/>
<br/>
When in Presentation mode, perhaps thereâs a colored border around the screen to be clear that youâre in a special context, or maybe a bit of text in the status bar at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Presentation Mode is actually a Quick Pref button so you can quickly pop in and out of it (for example, perhaps in the middle of the presentation you need to do some real editing, so you toggle it off, make the change, then toggle it back on.)

<br/>
Currently, inserting a lighting device onto a hanging position hangs it in the downward ZERO Y rotation regardless of the roll setting of the hanging position.Â <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, once a lighting device is attached to a hanging position, changing the roll value rotates the lighting position along its Y rotation axis.<br/>

<br/>
It would really useful to have a &#39;Trim Height&#39; or just a &#39;Height&#39; option in the toolmode bar for the linear insertion mode. This would enable users to enter a trim height using the toolmode bar short cut keys and greatly increase drawing speed for entertainment users

dividers for Layers and Sheets.<br/>
<br/>
Please see:<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/103708-dividers-for-layers-and-sheets/page/2/#comment-452792<br/>
<br/>
We also discussed the &quot;Saved Views&quot; palette.<br/>
<br/>
We would love to see an improvement for this kind of palette.<br/>
At the moment, the palette is only to represent the views but<br/>
nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
It would be useful to enhance the possibilities for this kind of<br/>
palette, to bring it to 21th century.<br/>
<br/>
Needed options:<br/>
<br/>
-Sorting options (#, names, â¦ like the design layers)<br/>
- Search options<br/>
- &quot;real&quot; Dividers<br/>
- Colors options for text and underlying<br/>
- Tags<br/>
- UI-size for the text (text is to small to read)<br/>

panning in the workspace.<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP = pan upwards<br/>
ARROW DOWN = pan down<br/>
<br/>
This behavior is also possible and i find it good:<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = moves object upward<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT + CMD = moves object 10 units upwards<br/>
<br/>
â¦<br/>
<br/>
The panning behavior is no longer in keeping with the times,<br/>
since every user can do this either with his mouse<br/>
or with the trackpad can do this better.<br/>
<br/>
So we can think about how we can assign the arrow keys<br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>
Here are my suggestions, I think they make sense:<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
In the Adobe or Affinity input fields, the arrow keys can be used to<br/>
Change value<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
ARROW UP = + one unit<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = + 10 units<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
ARROW DOWN = â one unit<br/>
ARROW UP + SHIFT = â 10 units<br/>
<br/>
To activate this behavior, you only have to enter the input field.<br/>
<br/>
This makes so much sense, because you<br/>
can work much faster!<br/>
<br/>
Attached, you will find a sample video.<br/>

I would love to see this in Vectorworks.<br/>

2.<br/>
Axis inferencing.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the axis directions can be fixed with the &quot;T&quot; key<br/>
during the drawing.<br/>
This solution is okay, but you always have to moving around with<br/>
the mouse and hover-over to find an axis of an existing object.<br/>
<br/>
This could be also done better with the arrow keys!<br/>
<br/>
I like the axis constrain of Sketchup.<br/>
There, you use the arrow keys.<br/>
Press arrow key to activate, press the same arrow key to<br/>
deactivate the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
ARROW UP: fixes drawing direction to z-Axis (blue)<br/>
ARROW RIGHT: fixes drawing direction to x-axis (red)<br/>
ARROW LEFT: fixes drawing direction to y-axis (green)<br/>
and special:<br/>
ARROW DOWN: fixes drawing direction to a custom direction<br/>
via hover-over a non-orthogonal line in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
This works also in Sketchup for drawing 2D geometry like rectangles, circles, â¦<br/>
or this works also for all the tools, e.g. Rotation Tool.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you want to rotate something 2D to stand up in 3D,<br/>
with the arrow keys, you can lock the VW Rotate Tool to rotation in z/x<br/>
or z/y direction.<br/>
<br/>
The behavior with the arrow keys in Sketchup is so intuitive and good designed<br/>
that it is a must to bring it to Vectorworks!Â <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Words are not always good for explaining, so a<br/>
here is a link to a tutorial video:<br/>

I would really love to see this in Vectorworks!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Both suggested solutions are for me a better choice for the arrow keys.<br/>
I think panning with the arrow keys are old-school!

<br/>
However, once you have more than one object selected, the latter doesn&#39;t work, i.e. you can&#39;t double click into any sort of container. The multiple selection prevents it entirely. You have to first deselect everything, then double click, make your edit, and finally re-select everything upon exiting the container.<br/>
<br/>
It would be much better if you could just double click on anything at any time and get the expected result, regardless of whether there&#39;s one thing, no thing, or multiple things selected.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
To boil it down to a simple example: the goal would be to have two groups selected, double click on one of the groups, and end up inside that group. Bam.

This can be unnecessarily hard work, especially for buildings with a lot of stories.<br/>
<br/>
A good solution for this issue could be:<br/>
- a check box to apply to all layers<br/>
<br/>
or even better (not mentioned ion the video):<br/>
- a button which leads to a list of the stories, where you can check the stories (also by multiple selection) where you want the default level to be active.<br/>

One of the biggest frustrations with using stories at this moment is that editing them means going through many confusing manipulations and dialogs. This option might be a step in a direction to make the workflow more streamlined.

Typing in the same name twice, feels like unnecessary double work.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I suggest to implement a checkbox &quot;same name as level&quot; in front of the design layer name field, so the design layer name can be filled in automatically by checking that box.<br/>

<br/>
These sub- objects should always be placed in a neutral class, so the user can simply assign the correct class via the OIP and can manage visibilities without the need for editing the symbol.<br/>

This &quot;neutral&quot; class can be either the class &quot;none&quot; or a new dedicated Enscape class (which should be automatically visible in existing saved views!).<br/>

<br/>
we really do have customers complaining about text getting kinda of blurry when zooming. They become dizzy, woozy and a headache (or even a migraine) when zooming all the day.<br/>
I promised to create a wish for better text representation when zooming.<br/>
I did a video so you see the blurriness.<br/>
It affects drawings with lot of text.<br/>
We already told the customer that there is preview mode when zooming for better performance.<br/>

As part of workflows where an existing building must be modelled, it would be amazing to have a similar interactive insertion ability for walls...<br/>
<br/>
Requirement:<br/>
 * To be able to drawing the length AND thickness of a wall by clicking with the mouse only.<br/>
 * To be able to work with unstyled walls (at very least) and styled walls (ideally, or perhaps after future wall re-engineering.) Â <br/>
<br/>
How it would work:<br/>
 # Activate the wall tool<br/>
 # Activate the interactive insertion mode of the wall tool. (This would by default draw an unstyled wall. As part of wall re-engineering, wall styles may be able to set one component to &quot;expand/contract&quot; to accommodate this interactive insertion mode. This would facilitate the inner- and outer-most components remaining constant thickness while the &quot;flexible&quot; component within the wall could accommodate the differences in thickness.)<br/>
 # The first click on the design layer starts drawing the wall&#39;s length (as it does now.)<br/>
 # The second click on the design layer end&#39;s drawing the wall&#39;s length (as it does now.)<br/>
 # The third click establishes the wall&#39;s thickness, from outside face to inside face. (If youÂ {*}double{*}-click at this stage to set the wall&#39;s thickness, the wall drawing action is complete. On the other hand, if you {*}single-{*}click at this stage then the wall&#39;s thickness is set AND the cursor relocates its position to the click point from step 4 â Â in order to draw the next segment of the wall using the three-click method{*}.{*})<br/>
 # (Optional bonus... Perhaps an additional click would allow you to set the height of the wall! That may be getting a bit carried away ;)Â )<br/>
<br/>
For a frame a reference, this interactive insertion mode for walls would behave similar to the current &quot;three points rotated&quot; modes of the rectangle tool and stair tool.

In the real world bridles are almost always built with a single upper leg using a chain, and in most cases the down leg will not have a chain at all

The only way to see what fonts a user might be missing is to import the drawing to the receiving machine. Once the list of missing fonts is shown, the receiving user must request those fonts from the original user.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to add a column into the font mapping dialog box to indicate what fonts are being used in the current document. The column could be populated with the word &quot;present&quot; for fonts stored in the local machine and the replacement font field would be greyed out.<br/>

<br/>
When a user places an emitter with a manual radius, the manually set radius should be retained when changing the catalog data, unless it is outside the defined values of the selected emitter/nozzle definition.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally a manually set radius should only change in very limited circumstances once set.<br/>
 * If the manual radius is &lt; minimum radius value when the catalog data is changed, it should reset to the minimum value<br/>
 * If the manual radius is &gt; maximum radius value when the catalog data is changed it should reset to the maximum value.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases an emitter radius can be adjusted (25% is common), if this could be easily taken into account before changing radius values that would be great, too. But not required.

<br/>
He regularly works on large scale productions as the rigging designer/technical planner and his preferred workflow for Braceworks is to have a separate file for the rigging calculations that he then copies the hoists and rigging from into a master file.<br/>
With the old hoist object he was able to copy and paste the hoists between the files and maintain the attached Braceworks calculation results related data, this is no longer possible with the new hoist as everytime a hoist is duplicated it resets its name, id and UUID, losing the calculation related data.<br/>
<br/>
He has requested that we add an option when duplicating hoist between files to preserve any attached data (names, id&#39;s, calculation data, etc...)

<br/>
Text-Styles are a bit too restrictive, because we don&#39;t have the option<br/>
<br/>
to save &quot;by style&quot; or &quot;by instance&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
I often struggle with doing some changes in my text-style and all<br/>
<br/>
related texts get a forced update and my custom changes/alignments<br/>
<br/>
would be overwritten, but I do not want all updates<br/>
<br/>
e.g. the alignment horizontal or vertical.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>

This could be fixed, if we got the option to save<br/>

it is often needed to having different Dimension-Standards/Styles,<br/>
<br/>
but we only have one option for the Standard-Class for all Dimension-Standards.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be useful to save the class of the Dimension inside the Dimension-Standard. With this solution, we are way more flexible with managing different dimensions.<br/>

Most importantly, this would allow a user to set keyboard shortcuts for these commands.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Make All Attributes by Class&quot; command is something I use hundreds of times per day. Currently, it&#39;s absolutely laborious to try to click the tiny hamburger icon every time without accidentally undocking the Attributes Palette or clicking the question mark... I&#39;d much prefer to just hit a keystroke, but currently Users are not given the option of adding hotkeys for these commands since they only exist in the Attribute Palette menu.<br/>
<br/>
Pat Stanford graciously wrote me a script that mostly does what the &quot;Make All Attributes be Class&quot; command does, which I&#39;ve added to my workspace, but it doesn&#39;t work as flawlessly as the official built-in command. It would better for Vectorworks were to officially support this.<br/>
<br/>
I would even recommend adding these for commands by default into a submenu within the &quot;Modify&quot; or &quot;Tools&quot; menus, which would increase discoverability. Of course, the commands should also stay in the Attributes Palette as well.<br/>

In the graphic attributes settings of a stair, you can change the marker for the walking line. You can not choose to have no marker at all. I got this request already a few times in a training. Now I need to advice to make the marker as small as possible, so it is not visible, which feels like a work around.<br/>
Especially for the start marker, you should be able to choose none, but I see no harm in implementing it for the end as well.<br/>

or similar to the Eyedropper tool with the ability to not only generally select Record or Plug-In Attributes but also which ones specifically. (e.g. only Cable and signal type, but not the cable number and not the circuit path and flag position.)<br/>

Would be great if the bridle parts would be in a seperate box beneath the bridle graphic.

<br/>
The Z information shown in the OIP is lacking. Currently the IOP shows the object&#39;s Z location relative to the active layer. If the active layer is changed the object&#39;s reported Z position may change. This makes it difficult to meaningfully know where an object is actually located in space. Knowing an object&#39;s Z position relative to the active layer&#39;s origin is not enough. Moving between layers does not change an object&#39;s X or Y value. Moving between layer should not change an object&#39;s Z value either. The only way to do this is to use geodetic Z values.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks needs to be able to report an object&#39;s geodetic elevation in the Object Information Palette. There should be an X, Y, Z and Geodetic Z field in the OIP. Further this geodetic field value should be editable just like the other fields.<br/>
<br/>
I have a work around for this shortcoming and it is super helpful for locating objects confidently. However, it is an extra few steps and may require the insertion of 3D loci.<br/>
<br/>
My work around for determining the true Z location of an object:<br/>
<br/>
Create a layer called &quot;Sea Level&quot; set its Z origin @ 0.<br/>
<br/>
Create a saved view called &#39;Go to Sea Level&#39;. This makes Sea Level the active layer without affecting layer or class settings.<br/>
<br/>
Select an object, run the saved view or just go to sea level layer. The OIP will now show the geodetic Z information of the object. See the last image.<br/>

<br/>
Wall Components in 2D Plan are drawn from left to right. The left one is at the bottom of the 2D stacking order, the right one is at the top. In most cases this is not apparent, because usually the contour lines of the components have the same color - only their thickness typically varies.<br/>
<br/>
However, some customers do use different colors for their components. Especially with data visualization, when they want to emphasize certain components for a specific construction phase of the building.<br/>
<br/>
In such a case they get undesired results - see attached screenshot, left image - &quot;one sided wall&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When component wrapping is applied, the problem becomes even more apparent (screenshot, middle image).<br/>
<br/>
What the customer expects, is shown in the image on the right.<br/>
<br/>
*Solution*<br/>
<br/>
Hard structural components should overlap softer, non structural components. For instance:<br/>
 # Load bearing should overlap insulation and plaster.<br/>
<br/>
 # Insulation should overlap air cavity.<br/>
<br/>
Since it might be hard to define the priority based on material properties (&#39;hard&#39;, &#39;softer&#39;, &#39;soft&#39;), the solution might be to offer a 2D stacking order in the wall style.

<br/>
We&#39;ll illustrate the problem with the wall styles, but it exists for all object styles.<br/>
<br/>
To get a proper file organization, the different types of walls are placed in (sub)folders in the .vwx file. Unfortunately, these (sub)folders are not visible in most parts of the interface. To our knowledge, this specific structure is only visible in the resource manager.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Walls<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
This tree structure should also be visible when replacing a wall style in the OIP. When selecting the wall to modify, you simply get the full list of all walls, either in the drawing itself or in the library. It would be better to be able to navigate through the created folders here too. If we then want to replace a foundation wall, we can first navigate to the foundation&#39;s folder and only see the associated walls instead of the entire list, which makes it very cluttered.

When you check off the option &quot;show 2D boundary&quot; in the OIP, selecting the space object is almost impossible, since the label is a separate object.<br/>
Now, the space is only selectable via a 2D locus. If you&#39;re lucky, this 2D locus is visible in the drawing but in many cases (depending on the wall configuration) this locus is hidden underneath the label or displaced to a complete different location.<br/>

At this moment, the core component is used as the main reference in the wall wrapping configuration. this seems to have as a result that the core component itself can&#39;t be wrapped. However, this is needed to be able to do some wall closure types. Changing the core in the wall style settings isn&#39;t a sufficient workaround, because that manipulation is too impactful on the rest of the drawing (slab- wall and roof- wall connections, connections between walls, alignments,...)<br/>

*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Wall<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
- Not only use a &quot;core&quot; component, but also have the option to use a &quot;structural&quot; component. While the core can be used for alignment and wrapping, the structural component can be used for connecting building shell element. Multiple components can be assigned as structural, which also fixed the &quot;wall between two appartments&quot;- issue.<br/>
<br/>
Or<br/>
<br/>
- The core component and the &quot;wrapping reference&quot; component can be the same by default, but the user can choose to set another component as wrapping reference independently.

When you create an elevation via a section viewport, the line thicknesses are determined by the line thicknesses of the objects in 2D plan. Usually, this is not relevant for an elevation view and leads to a messy and poorly readable drawing.<br/>
One thing you can currently already do, is use one class to control all line thicknesses behind the cut plane. This is a recommended option to make the drawing cleaner, but still comes with its issues. Readability is still poor, because there&#39;s no sense of depth and it puts also the surface hatch lines in that same class, which is an undesired side effect (I&#39;ll make a bug report for that last one)<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Create section viewport<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
In the advanced settings of a section viewport, there should be an interface which allows the user to control the line thickness of objects by a depth range. For example: all objects between 0 and 3m behind cut plane have a thickness of 0,5mm, between 3 and 6 0,25 and so on. This setting should NOT affect the line thickness of surface hatches.<br/>
<br/>
*Remark:*<br/>
<br/>
It is preferable to use &#39;section viewports&#39; over &#39;elevation views&#39; (back / front / left / right) for the creation of facade views. The elevation views are limited to 90Â° angles (which leaves a &#39;gap&#39; for facades that are at a different angle), and the &#39;elevation views&#39; do not cut through the terrain model.

To my mind, the Layer behaviour is the correct one as one would normally create a new Layer in order to use it. This would seem like an obvious behaviour for Class creation as well. I rarely create a new Class without wanting to immediately use it.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, could there be a new checkbox to set a Class to Active immediately after it has been created in the same way that exists for Class Viewport and Saved View Visibilities?

<br/>
Suggested solution from Maarten: &quot;Having the option to make the background of the custom control transparent would already by a huge step forward.<br/>
And an SDK function that returns if dark mode is active or not is also very useful, that way we can change the color of the objects we draw inside the custom control to a lighter shade so they will be visible on a dark background.&quot;

The current vehicle libraries only offers 3D and 2D-plan views. Customers are asking for proper / clean 2D side, front and back views of the library objects.<br/>
<br/>
The views that are generated automatically by Vectorworks are not clean enough (and Vectorworks regularly crashes when generating the side views). Please check the attached images to see the quality difference between the top view that is included in the vehicle symbol, and the side views that are generated by Vectorworks.<br/>

<br/>
That system works, but it has a major limitation. Since it is read-only, the selection field (drop down in the OIP in the movie) doesn&#39;t show which set was selected or applied last. We can save that information in the object, but that would slow down the display of the data in the OIP significantly.<br/>
<br/>
If Vectorworks would offer a way via the SDK to store a data set as a resource (and let the user manage it accordingly), then the speed hit would most likely disappear. We can currently not use Object styles for that, because the object style applies to the full object - not to specific parts of it. A sub-objectstyle of sorts might be a potential solution.Â <br/>
<br/>
This problem also ties into the control over sub-objects in larger parametric objects. There, too, we feel the need to define &#39;sets&#39; that can be treated and managed as a resource.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie shows the problem for our Window tool, but it exists for all complex objects in Vectorworks.

Â <br/>
This is how I imagined that search bar in a dialog (see video in attachment).<br/>
There are a few things I&#39;m not sure about: # While changing a parameter, should that search &quot;popover&quot; stay open or should it close (like I show in the mockup)<br/>
 # Is it up to the developer to categorize the control (in that &quot;category&quot; (group box, tab) the control will show in the search &quot;popover&quot;), or is the system smart enough to figure it out by itself?<br/>
 # Should all controls be adjustable in the search &quot;popover&quot; or is this something the developer should decide?<br/>
 # That flare when clicking on an entry in the search popover: should it only happen for disabled controls or for all?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that flare has to be more clear? Or last longer? Or maybe something else that draws the user&#39;s attention (that blur overlay maybe?). But I&#39;m sureÂ [@ilane|https://designexpress.slack.com/team/U4ZEY8UER]Â and team can come up with something nice for thisÂ !https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f642.png!Â (if this idea gets accepted off course).<br/>
Â <br/>
Oh, and off course, when hitting cmd+F/ctrl+F in a dialog, that same search bar should roll out and become active.<br/>

The way a texture is mapped by default when you place it on a rectangular extrude is different in version 2022/2023 compared to 2021. Now the mapping mode is &quot;Surface UV&quot; in stead of &quot;Perimeter&quot; before.<br/>
As a consequence of this, since version 2022, the texture is applied rotated compared to the texture preview on the sides of a rectangular extrude.<br/>
The result in version 2021 was better.<br/>
This has been reported as a bug (0007121) but has been categorized as &quot;works as designed&quot; in Jira.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
- Edit the behavior of &quot;Surface UV&quot; so the result is more desirable<br/>
or<br/>
- Use &quot;auto align&quot; as the default texture mapping for an extrude (behavior is similar to the old &quot;perimeter&quot; option)

If we draw a volume in Vectorworks, by drawing a line on one of the faces I can split this face in order to extrude or pull back the volume below or above the line. You would then think that this plane now consists of 2 separate planes, so you can apply different textures to the part above the line and below the line. However, if you want to place a texture on this plane, it will be seen again as one plane and the line has no influence on it.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
If you divide a surface by means of a line, you can not only adjust the volume with it, but also have the possibility to give these surfaces a separate texture.

The current iteration of the Texture tool can only place textures on a surface. A good extension would be that we could also choose to use uniform colors (and by extension the other surface fills from the attribute palette) to color in the volumes.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
texture<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
The possibility to also choose a uniform color as the fill color for the volumes. Now we must first make a texture of a fill color before it can be applied as a fill to an object. A possible interim solution could be to draw a surface with the correct fill color and convert it with a right mouse click to a texture. The shortest way is of course that when selecting the tool you can choose between a texture or a 2D attribute fill.

For a wall or a slab , the texture and its surface hatch don&#39;t follow the orientation of the object. When the plug-in object is not orthogonally oriented, the problem is clearly visible.<br/>
<br/>
The only workaround I found is to set the plug-in object Texture option to &quot;Use object Textures&quot;. Then in the IOP, I can apply a rotation to the texture. But when the object will rotate again, the problem will still be there.

If I want to replace the wall style of an existing wall, I can do so via the OIP. However, Vectorworks doesn&#39;t ask me about the location for the replacing wall style. The new wall style is automatically put in the root folder of the .vwx file. I have to manually move it to the correct folder.<br/>
<br/>
*Solution:*<br/>
If I&#39;m replacing a wall, I&#39;d also like to see the dialogue first to save my wall in the correct place in my drawing before closing the wall replacement window.

<br/>
When importing a resource into a vwx file through the Resource Manager, a dialog pops up asking which organizational method should be used (keep folder structure, select different destination folder, create new resource folder).<br/>
<br/>
When I select a wall style from the tool dropdown, I don&#39;t get prompted about the desired resource location. The used resource is simply place in the root of the vwx file. If you want to reorganize it, you have to do it manually after the facts.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
If a wall is placed via any method (resource manager/method bar) you always get the window where you want to place that wall in the drawing, unless you as a user have checked the option not to show this window anymore.

We can adjust the texture per side via the info palette, but first we have to select the wall and then the side of the wall to give a different texture for this side.. Much more intuitive would be with the texture tool sliding over the wall and the lightening side of the wall via a click of the texture it could provide.

I&#39;ve noticed that the update of libraries in Vectorworks is happening in the background and once you&#39;ve updated your libraries with new content available, you don&#39;t know what is actually new. It could improve the UX, if new resources stand out a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: tools / commands:*<br/>
Resource Manager<br/>
<br/>
*Optional: solution:*<br/>
1.) Add a separate &quot;New&quot; category in the Resource Manager to existing ones (Premium libraries, Vectorworks libraries etc.) and make Vectorworks remove the content of that category after a specific period of time OR<br/>
2.) Add a visual label to resources (for example in the preview dialog in the upper right corner of the Resource Manager) OR<br/>
3.) Add a tag &quot;New&quot; to the list of tags<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m attaching an example how Enscape highlights new assets in their library.

Desired is a horizontal offset value from the measurement point to the start point of the leader line. Regular Dimension objects do already offers such an offset value (See dimension standard settings: distance between the end points of a dimension and the end points of its witness lines).<br/>
<br/>
Also, the alignment of Elevation Benchmark objects will move the measurement point too. It would be great if the measurement point would keep it&#39;s position and it will only move the marker itself. Exactly this behavoir is already possible with Data Tags if the are associated with objects.

Knapp AG exports ifc and send them to a subcontractor who merges two ifc-files into one. And the other file has meters as unit.<br/>

While it might work &#39;as designed&#39;, three incremental improvements are possible:<br/>
 # Don&#39;t let the dormer disappear. Simply revert it to the previous slope settings (and inform the user accordingly).<br/>
 # Allow a slope between 0Â° and 2Â°. From a construction POV a 2Â° limit might seem like a logical choice, but designers prefer to use 0Â° for esthetic reasons (even if it might not be constructed that way).<br/>
 # Allow a negative slope value, so that the shed and the main roof meet each other at a &#39;negative V&#39; or gutter.

 * Maybe it could be an option to only activate the option while using the attributes tool by default, and implementing a mode which the user can activate while drawing 2D forms.<br/>
 * Alternatively, it could be a snap setting (bottom right corner) which, when active, would a user allow to snap to the hatches and tile fills of the selected (and only the selected) objects.

He mentioned that one of the things slowing down his Spotlight workflow vs his old AutoCAD workflow was setting up and configuring Viewports in Vectorworks. Specifically in AutoCAD users can hover the mouse pointer over a viewport and then use the mouse wheel to interactively zoom/scale the view, without having to go through multiple mouse clicks and/or dialogues.<br/>
His typical workflow is to set the viewport up for a specific paper size and then adjust the zoom/scale to best display the part of his design it is documenting

<br/>
To mitigate the confusion and wasted time with having to download the Vectorworks viewer, why can&#39;t it be, for desktop users, online (like BIM 360), or for those on devices, via the Nomad app?<br/>
<br/>
Expecting clients to download a 750+Mb (!!) installer is unrealistic and does the platform a disservice by making it too hard to view files.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as more customers are switching to subscriptions with people dipping in and out, this issue becomes only more important. I consider this an existential thread to the quality of the customer experience (or as Tim &#39;Apple&#39; would say, &#39;customer sat&#39;).Â

                                            <td class="description">      Currently the Smart Options Display remains open after a tool or option has been clicked. It makes sense that it would close after a choice has been made. When it lingers, one has to move the mouse well clear of the palettes for it to close on its own.Â <br/>
<br/>
There may be reasons for it to remain open, but after a mental exercise considering why that might be valid, I think the reasons to close it and the workflow benefits of doing so far outweigh the reasons to keep it open.Â <br/>
<br/>
Reasons that{color:#172b4d} is should stay open are below. Refutes are indented.Â {color}<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}One may accidentally click the wrong tool and want another chance to select another without delay. {color}<br/>
 ** {color:#172b4d}BUT: Accidental clicks will be a tiny minority and reopening the SOD is one spacebar tap away.Â {color}<br/>
<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}When Standard Views are one of the options offered in the Smart Options Display, one may like to click through multiple views one after the other. {color}<br/>
 ** {color:#172b4d}BUT: This can be achieved using the keyboard NumberPad - which is perpetually available - or the Flyover tool.Â {color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#172b4d}Reasons the Smart Options Display should close after a selection is made:Â {color}<br/>
 * {color:#172b4d}The va{color}st majority of selections made will be the desired option.Â <br/>
 * The palette will cease to obscure the drawing behind immediately after the pertinent tool is chosen allowing the users focus to be directed to the area of the drawing for which the tool was selected.Â <br/>
 * The user does not need to move the cursor away from the SOD only to have to bring it back again (when the subject is under the SOD palettes which was the case in my demonstration).Â <br/>
 * This will make it unnecessary to performÂ _another action_ to make it close. Either moving the cursor away or tapping the Spacebar again (which interestingly does not require the cursor to remain still!)Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
I vote that the Smart Options Display close as soon as a tool/option is selected. An example of the SOD being unexpectedly in the way presents itself perfectly when I was recording a demonstration for my other, previous VE. I&#39;ve attached the same recording to this task so you may see what I mean.Â <br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve adopted what has already been created for Graphic Legends to show what I mean below.<br/>
<br/>
!Viewport Annotation Layout.png|width=588,height=341!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I believe the Drawing Label is automatically placed on the bottom/center of the Viewport and then has to manually be adjusted (correct me if I am wrong). This would provide an excellent way to set labels up from the beginning removing many unnecessary clicks. Example: you have a sheet with a dozen detail viewports, each with a drawing label and you want to either left or right-justify them. If you adjust this style setting, all details will pick up the new location of the Drawing Label.<br/>

<br/>
At least if it was offset from the edge of the display, that behaviour wouldn&#39;t be so aggressive - and it is perceived as a valued part of Vectorworks, not some dodgy pop-up window preventing me from going to the next task.<br/>

I apologise is this VE request sounds direct, but the psychological implications of each features need to be thought through â esp when UI/IX overwhelms cognitive load, design workflow and impedes task switching.

                                            <td class="description">      Smart Options Display is the most impactful UI enhancement I can remember. It has sped up my workflow and it has further potential to make working in Vectorworks even better,Â _ever-faster_Â and more enjoyable with just a few minor tweaks. My submissionÂ affects every user and every use of this function: _Activating_ the Smart Options Display.Â <br/>
<br/>
*The problem:*Â <br/>
<br/>
Currently the Smart Options Display is activated when the Spacebar key is depressed-and-released quickly. But for this to work there is an undisclosed requirement: The cursor must not be moving at the time. This is both unexpected, unnatural and unnecessary.Â <br/>
 * Unexpected because users are [schooled by Vectorworks Help|https://app-help.vectorworks.net/2023/eng/VW2023_Guide/Start/Smart_Options_Display.htm] that if the spacebar is tapped, the Smart Options Display will appear. There is no stipulation in Vectorworks Help that the cursor must be still.Â <br/>
 * Unnatural because all other functions activated by keyboard commands are not contingent on the cursor being unmoving.Â <br/>
 * Unnecessary because (as far as I can see) there would be no conflicts with other UI functions if it was set up to be triggered simply by tapping the Spacebar irrespective of cursor movement. The Boomerang Pan Tool activates when the Spacebar is held down. The Smart Options Display appears only if the Spacebar _comes up again_ within an instant so no conflict will occur between the two functions.Â <br/>
<br/>
The way it currently works requires that users with a mouse, must stop moving it before they can activate this function. If they were moving the cursor to where it is needed, this means the must stop moving, tap Spacebar, start moving again towards the desired tool, stop to click on the tool, then continue to move to the precise location it will be used.Â <br/>
<br/>
For users that draw with a graphics tablet, the cursor moves constantly while the pen hovers above the tablet surface. This means the Smart Options Display can&#39;t be activated reliably or easily. The user must lift the pen up out of the tablet&#39;s range of reception for the cursor to stop moving or rest it on the surface so lightly that a &#39;click&#39; is not triggered (which is nigh impossible and even harder when working at-speed). Lifting the pen out of range is an ergonomic nightmare as it strains the wrist to lift it high enough, especially when done a lot. The Smart Options Display is intended to be used for various functions that are needed most often, so it will be used frequently increasing the risk of OOS/RSI.Â <br/>
<br/>
*The Solution:*Â <br/>
<br/>
Adjust the software so that the Smart Options Display is triggered when the Spacebar is depressed-and-released within the required time, _irrespective_ of cursor movement.Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
See the screen recording attached.Â <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!Â <br/>

<br/>
We would like to prep our BIM templates (with Stories and wall styles) in the English version of Vectorworks. Right now we need to do this in the localized version, otherwise our own story levels donât appear in the .sta files. This is a change that needs to be facilitated by VW, inc.<br/>
<br/>
Question 2:<br/>
<br/>
We translate the templates automatically via the sdk, for all our localized languages. But for the templates we cannot translate them in the English Vectorworks, because the stories are default imported in a localized Vectorworks version. We always need to translate the templates in the corresponding localized Vectorworks version. Quite annoying and time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Can this be changed? Via sdk?<br/>
<br/>
This is related to question 1:<br/>
<br/>
The stories and levels are to much fixed in Vectorworks. They should be more flexible.

<br/>
1. It would be nice to be able to navigate to the cell item in the resource folder (or go directly to edit it) from the cell. We are using graphic legends with walls, roofs and slabs and making data changes right from the cell would save us from having to navigate the resource manager to find the correct item.<br/>
2. In the dialog box for Cell Visibility and Sorting there is a Show column, which allows you to show or hide a cell. The problem is that if you hide a cell, and later go back to show it, the annotations get deleted. I would not expect this behaviour from the term &quot;show&quot; or &quot;hide&quot;. If it is technically not possible to save the annotations so that they can reappear when clicking hide, then a warning should appear if you are setting a cell to hide and it has annotations. I think a similar warning should be present for viewports as well. A visual non-printing reminder of whether or not a cell (or viewport) has content would be very useful.

<br/>
But because we made this change, another issue has popped up: In a formula (e.g. =left(Class,2) the data manager states that it needs a Comma (Comma Expected), while it actually needs a semicolon to work in our localized version.<br/>
<br/>
This issue also occurs for worksheets and is very confusing for customers.<br/>
<br/>
A solution could be to provide two sets of settings, in the same way we&#39;re offered to work with an imperial or metric system.

(This request should NOT be confused with a more advanced request for &#39;live-sync&#39; or two-way data exchange between Excel and Vectorworks.) This request is only concerned with &#39;referencing&#39; of the Excel file itself, in a similar manner to the processes that we currently have for referencing DWG, IFC, Revit (and our own VWX) files.)<br/>
<br/>
Typical use cases include big customers such as Starbucks who want to access external data which is updated on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
The current workflow requires any user with the requirement to manually import and reimport the data. Any such repetition increases the risk of error due to the manual nature of such operations or simply missing the fact that the data needs updating.<br/>
<br/>
*FYI, the data is often hooked up to other Vectorworks functions using the very useful Lookup function that was added a few version ago. *Also, this request is specifically for Excel, (as opposed to other data options such as ODBC) because of the commonality of the format.<br/>

Regarding to VB-191675 it is not a bug. So it&#39;s at least a wish then.<br/>
<br/>
BLK Corner don&#39;t really need truss pieces on every exit.<br/>
In reality you have a trussline with two BLK corner on every end.<br/>
You attach two hoist on the corner blocks and lift them up.<br/>
Braceworks doesn&#39;t like that and needs another truss line on one exit of the corner.<br/>

For me, this is a very useful modifying command for working on floating text objects in construction details, and general notes on sheets. Text Merge has been in use in AutoCAD for many years, and its competitor BricsCAD also recently added it. The command takes away the tedium of having to select text content in a block of text, cut or copy it, and then pasting it at the end of another block of text. I always add it to my workspace whenever I update the Vectorworks version. I don&#39;t know who is the author of this (Julian Carr MIGHT have written it), but I got the script on a message board somewhere, and made a menu command from it. When the command starts, the cursor turns into a target, and the user clicks on the first block of text to be merged. After clicking on the second text and so on with the same target cursor, the user clicks on an empty space, and the selected text objects are all merged.

The tool should stop inserting cables once it reaches a connection type that does not match the preceding cables. In this case, it should stop when it reaches the 208 V option.<br/>

Currently, the tool seeks out the &quot;next free output&quot; from the beginning of the list regardless of starting point. Thus, my first placed cable is my Socapex, followed by an Edison cable. This is not the desired result.<br/>

This current method requires the user to select the desired output each and every time. Thus, adding considerable time to the process.

When using break-ins with distributors, we rarely need jumpers to connect them. Since break-ins come with cables, they plug directly into the sockets contained within distributors.<br/>

At the moment, the only way to connect a break-in to a distributor is via the connection pulldown menus. These automatically insert unneeded jumper cables.Â <br/>

Each consumer device needs to have ownership of the connector regardless of the circuit it is patched to via the power planning workflow.

<br/>
When working with production design and previs department it would be amazing to be able to export Redshift Proxies to be used by previs in Maya, Blender or Houdini.Â <br/>
<br/>
Redshift proxies export the entire scene, lighting and textures as a redshift file that can be used in other applications running redshift.Â <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how hard redshift proxie export would be to implement now that the redshift renderer seems to be working so well.Â Â <br/>
<br/>
Off-course USD (Universal Scene Description) would be the unltimate goal.

This workflow would also be very familiar to Adobe users.

I was making a Graphic Legend in an empty file. I edited the Title Layout as I wanted to colour the title background.<br/>
<br/>
As per the screen shot it looks like a regular rectangle (although described in the OIP as a &#39;Title Frame in Graphic Legend&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
It is counter-intuitive as I thought that I could simply treat it as a rectangle and change the fill colour etc but nothing changed. So I filed a bug:<br/>
<br/>
VB-189409<br/>
Graphic Legends: Virgin GL unable to colour the background rectangle of the Title<br/>
<br/>
Obviously rejected as it WAD. So this requesat is that this default display *should not look* like a regular rectangle, but one say with dashed lines as per my mock up screenshot. This is more in common with this type of object and makes it more intuitive for users. It fooled me, a beta tester of 26 years!<br/>

Cheers,<br/>
Peter <br/>

I try to file bugs as part of my workflow, but sometimes I also just don&#39;t have the time to make a proper report.<br/>
<br/>
Add a Report bug item in the help menu that would automatically populate a bug submit form with the version, OS, and contact info, as well as upload the current drawing file, the user log, and a snapshot of the drawing window. Reporting a bug would be as easy as typing in a title and description.<br/>
<br/>
While some bugs require more explanation or preliminary testing, this would be perfect for straightforwards annoyances or malfunctions, as well as make bug reporting more accessible for general users.

<br/>
The Spotlight&gt;Visualisation&gt;Set Spotlight Rendering Options dialogue globally affects all lighting devices in a drawing. Yet even if all Lighting Devices in a drawing are all using lit fog for example and the design layer is already rendered, when you open the dialogue the lit fog option is unchecked. Yet the Renderworks background is correctly indicated in the dialogue. It seems unintuitive so much so that I thought it was a bug (it turned off the lit fog which was already on). This made me report:Â <br/>
<br/>
[Vectorworks BugsVB-191399|VB-191399]<br/>
Spotlight&gt;Visualisation&gt;Set Spotlight Rendering Options... dialogue kills lit fog. However this is WAD hence this VE.<br/>
<br/>
The VE is that the dialogue has some different options/selection criteria.<br/>
 * That it reflects all of the current rendering state of the current render eg lit fog, Renderworks background etc.<br/>
 * If there is a mixture of some lighting devices using lit fog, some not, fall off with a mixture of none/realistic/smooth then the lit fog and fall off should be greyed out. This is in keeping with current conventions.<br/>
 * That there are options to select and therefore affect Lighting Devices by other criteria eg lit fog, position, purpose, fall off, on or off and so on. This makes the dialogue much more powerful and versatile. At the moment it is all or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I realise this is low priority but it would be very useful with it being more adaptable.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Transferred attributes may be hidden by the active DataÂ Visualization.&quot;<br/>

While informational at first, these pop-ups become incredibly annoying when trying to use the Eyedropper in this context. They appear upon every single click.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these messages should just be changed to red warnings that appear in the status bar at the bottom of the screen, instead of a modal pop-up that delays the ability to keep working.<br/>
<br/>
If not that, then the ability to suppress each message for the rest of the session would be another solution.

It seems pretty common for viewports on the same sheet to use the same benchmark setup, so being able to edit mode than one at a time would be a big time-saver. Other  viewport buttons (Advanced Properties, Classes, render settings, etc) seem to handle multiple selection without a problem.

Users either have to individually add it as annotation in each cell or draw it over the top of the Graphic Legend.Â  Neither method is satisfactory.<br/>
<br/>
What we need is an option with door and window schedules to automatically draw a floor line in each cell for the width of the cell.Â  That way there won&#39;t be a disconnect occur when a cell height changes.Â  It needs to be classed separately so the user can define its graphic attributes - line thickness, line type and colour.Â  There also needs to be an option to include the text FL at the left hand end of each line.<br/>

In VB-183303, Julian Carr indicated:<br/>
&quot;It seems to me that the alignment of images and the display of doors and windows at their relative vertical positions should be separately controlled. The intent of the graphic I included was mainly to illustrate that we should not be relying on vertical dimensions, to trigger the vertical displacement of the images. Rather a checkbox to trigger this independently of the vertical dimension selection would be much better.&quot;<br/>

Unfortunately you cannot multiselect or select all for this and have to go through each check individiually. While generally you only have to do this once it would be nice to be able to select things in a similar way to layers and classes, select all, shift select, cmnd select etc

Diametrical and diametral are both acceptable terms (along with diametric), but Vectorworks should choose one and stick with it for consistency. In my opinion, &quot;diametrical&quot; is best.

Please can we have the ability like Title Block Borders to scale a Graphic Legend so it can fit on the page?<br/>

In the enclosed screenshot you can see a Graphic Legend that has been formatted to one&#39;s liking. However, it is slightly too big to fit on the page. Changing anything about the Graphic Legend will most likely change the cell layouts which is not desirable.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that there is a scale option in the OIP so users can put in a multiplication factor in order to scale it. In this example it might be &#39;0.9&#39; for example. Just like title blocks etc.<br/>

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
we need to improve the way we align truss corners. It is very difficult to control the direction in which a truss corner is inserted.<br/>
<br/>
You often have to change the view to get control over the orientation of the corner. Even then, it is not always possible to bring the corner into the desired orientation. As a result, the customer loses a lot of time when drawing elaborate truss constructions. Especially with corners that have more than 2 ways, it becomes a matter of chance whether the corner sits correctly or not. The rotating tool helps here in the rarest cases.<br/>
<br/>
The magnets are a great tool for creating non-rectangular connections, but do not help with a corner that can be rotated 360Â° because they are not fixed.<br/>
<br/>
We hear this behavior a lot here in tech support and we don&#39;t have a good solution for it. Some users are frustrated because they take too long to draw.<br/>
<br/>
In the attached video I try to provide orientation in all 4 directions. This is very tedious.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Greetings<br/>
Martin<br/>

This is sometimes useful, but other times can be problematic, as the image might show something with fixed proportions, and therefore the X and Y always want to scale proportionally with each other (which can be done by grabbing a corner point and holding shift). However, if at some point the Bitmap was inadvertently stretched along only one axis, the proportions are now incorrect and there&#39;s no way to reset it. The only reliable fix is to import the original image once again. However, if you don&#39;t HAVE the original image file, then you&#39;re sort of screwed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
{color:#FF0000}*The most important one for us is item 4. Without item 4 implemented we won&#39;t be able to use Graphic Legend for windows legends, because we work to structural openings and we need toÂ dimension to the floor. Please, we&#39;re so close!!!*{color}<br/>
 # I don&#39;t think the dropdown menu listing various combinations of dimensions is the right way to go. This requires that Vectorworks second guess the combinations its users may want. And, to prove a point, the combination I wantÂ is not there (i.e. rough opening + sill to floor). While it&#39;s conceivable that you may be able to provide a list of all the combinationsÂ users may want, I thinkÂ it would be much more desirable (and more intuitive) if instead of aÂ requiring a single choice, we couldÂ simply check or uncheck the types we want and make our ownÂ combinations.<br/>
 # It wouldÂ be extremely useful if we could overrideÂ auto-dimension settings for aÂ single cell. Or perhaps the ability to goÂ into a cell and simply deleteÂ dimensions (and not have themÂ regenerate?)?Â There are many examples where I might want to show sash dimensions in some cells but not others, for instance.<br/>
 # Missing auto-dimension types:<br/>
 ## Unit size (i.e. &#39;rough opening minusÂ shim gaps&#39;). I thought Frame might be &#39;rough opening minusÂ shim gaps&#39; but it doesn&#39;t seem to be, or perhapsÂ there&#39;s something peculiar about my window jamb configurations? Because Frame provides a much smaller dimension than &#39;rough opening minus shim gaps&#39;.<br/>
 ## Mullions and Transoms. We don&#39;t really dimension to sashes. We dimension to rough openings and when want to show a correlation of heightsÂ across differentÂ windows we generally dimension to a transom, not the sash.<br/>
 # {color:#FF0000}Missing combinations:{color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening + Sill to floor [sill in this case being the bottom of the rough opening){color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening + Sill to floor + Unit **{color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening + Sill to floor + UnitÂ + Sash **{color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening +Â UnitÂ + Sash **{color}<br/>
 ## {color:#FF0000}Rough Opening +Â Unit **{color}<br/>
<br/>
{color:#FF0000}**Â if Frame is indeed meant to provide &#39;rough opening minus shim gaps&#39; then substitute &quot;Unit&quot; with &quot;Frame&quot;{color}

This VE is to suggest that it would be great if their geographic location could be detected and their storage automatically changed to the nearest storage server.<br/>

I suspect that many users will not know about this new preference and as the VCS is increasingly being used for Project Sharing anything that expedites it&#39;s efficiencies, if done by us first, would give a better user experience.<br/>

I had just rebooted my machine and opened Vectorworks 2022 SP3B2. <br/>
<br/>
With an extremely simple test model with one Renderworks Spotlight pointing to a chair in a room, I noticed that all Renderworks options (Artistic, Fast, Final Quality, Custom, Styled etc) only showed the Shaded render. Even the &#39;B&#39; key X-Ray mode wasn&#39;t working correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I then realised that Cineware by Maxon had crashed and/or failed to launch which I confirmed with Activity Monitor.<br/>
<br/>
The wish is that if this happens an error message could come up saying something like: &quot;there has been a problem with the rendering engine please quit and re-launch the program&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, how else would the user know? In this situation it is just a bad user experience with users being unable to fathom why they aren&#39;t getting the results they expected. This was in spite of there being a tick appearing to show that those rendering modes were being used at the time<br/>
<br/>
Movie and file enclosed. I don&#39;t know if Cineware by Maxon creates any crash logs?<br/>

Some users miss this, and it causes delays in support because it is assumed therefore that their OS is macOS 12 when it could be windows. Speaking of which Windows 11 needs to be added in the list.<br/>

A lot of venues and users customise their most common configurations of tools. Today I had a customer with 8 licences who wanted to create some Red Symbols for some Softgoods as well as Video screens.<br/>
<br/>
The softgoods has a pull down so they could click on that and access the Resource Selector and immediately find a favourite file with those drapes. However if doing the same for any of the above it is not possible. The only way is via the Resource Manager.<br/>
This is inconsistent and a mixed workflow, hence the wish that the pull down be available for all tools.<br/>

As more users get access to Vision in the future,Â more lighting rigs with conventional instruments will be exported to it.<br/>
<br/>
Lighting Designers (LD) use the colour field in the OIP to colour the rig.<br/>
<br/>
Currently if it is exported to Vision this colour (gel) information does not come across. This means that LDs would have to tediously re-enter the gel colour in Vision for every conventional instrument. It seems very strange that such a fundamental part of the design process and central to plotting cues for a show, has to be doubled up with such an effort in order to use Vision.<br/>
<br/>
This VE is that the colour field in the OIP gets pushed out to theÂ &#39;Colour wheel 1 slot 1&#39; part of the Lighting Device Edit dialogue so that it can immediately be used in Vision.<br/>

As per this forum post I put up ages ago and got little traction until recently:<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/74778-why-do-the-house-rigging-points-all-have-the-same-allowable-force-z/#comment-427446<br/>
<br/>
This VE is to ask that each symbol has the appropriate kilonewton force applied. Currently no matter what the capacity is of the symbol via it&#39;s name, they are all set to 5kN. This is tedious to have to manually change each one after placement and is something that could produce errors.<br/>
Also, it would be good to be able to have an auto numbering option like the Hoist tool has in order for easy identification for users. These small tweaks would make using the tool much more efficient.<br/>

<br/>
The MVR format promises great things including two-way updating of geometry and lighting device changes between the two programs. However this is not possible at theÂ moment.<br/>
<br/>
Often it is only when plotting a show that a lighting designer realises they have to physically adjust a lighting instrument&#39;s position, or colour perhaps, or if designing a set maybe moveÂ parts of the set for example.<br/>
<br/>
To be able to make those adjustments in Vision and export via MVR so that those changes can be imported back into Vectorworks is the reason for this VE.<br/>

Has an excellent 1st paragraph (that I show in my own notes for 3D modelling courses) but this VE is for the 2nd paragraph to be possibly reconsidered. It says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When modeling in 3D, the &quot;working&quot; plane is the 3D plane where geometry is placed, and where the cursor snaps to when no other 3D snap is active (the cursor is not snapping to 3D geometry). The working plane can be on the layer plane, or in any other orientation required. When the working plane is not on the layer plane, it becomes visible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The part I think is not clear and which is confusing is: &quot;...and where the cursor snaps to when no other 3D snap is active (the cursor is not snapping to 3D geometry).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I get the idea and sort of know what you&#39;re getting at but it adds a veneer of gobbledegook (sorry) that confuses users.<br/>
<br/>
Might it be considered to drop this or reword if really really necessary?!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Peter<br/>

However, there are times where a user may need additional detail compared to what&#39;s displayed here. For example, I needed information about how to edit the Clip Cube but there&#39;s nothing about it on this pane.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, at the bottom of the &quot;?&quot; pane there should be a link to the full Help page for the relevant topic (eitherÂ [View 3D models of .vwx files|https://cloud.vectorworks.net/portal/help/pages/view-3d-models-of-vwx-files/?app=IOS_NOMAD]Â orÂ [View 3D models in AR|https://cloud.vectorworks.net/portal/help/pages/view-3d-models-in-ar/?app=IOS_NOMAD]). This would open in the default browser.<br/>
<br/>
Currently a user has to exit the &quot;?&quot; pane, exit the model viewer, click Account, Click Help, then find the relevant page. (That is, if the user even knows these great Help pages even exist in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
Not only would adding a link in the viewer increase discoverability, but that way the 3D model would remain open in the viewer so it&#39;s easy to jump back in where the user left off.

In DropdownExample1.png you can see the dropdown has 3 choices, but the third choice is cut off and there&#39;s a small scrollbar. There&#39;s no reason there should be a scrollbar. All three choices should be clearly visible right off the bat.<br/>
<br/>
In DropdownExample2.png you can see that the background of the dropdown box is translucent and appears on top of adjacent settings. This makes it hard to read since there&#39;s overlapping visual information.

<br/>
It would be most helpful if labels in the label legend had word wrap; if text was wider than the label, it would wrap to a second line. and if there were other labels that were &quot;lower&quot; than this one, it/they would be appropriately shifted down to remain visible. &lt;/Lighting&gt;<br/>

Compare rendering in OprnGL/Shaded and Renderworks. Shaded inverts the shadow, as well as treat the color as bitmap. The next generation of shaded would, ideally:<br/>
<br/>
- Not invert the shadow<br/>
- Allow for full color and grayscale projection<br/>
- Provide a legacy mode for those who have crafted Shaded renders on the existing behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I also included a Redshift version, which completely blurs the projection.

<br/>
For many objects this makes sense - Doors, windows, walls, furniture etc. For objects that need to maintain their Z position relative to the layer origin this functionality works.<br/>
<br/>
For many other types of objects, no matter which layer they are on, their world Z position should remain unchanged when moved from layer to layer.<br/>
<br/>
Vectorworks does not have a function that allows an object to maintain its absolute position when moved between layers.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very useful to have the option to lock an object&#39;s Z value when moved between layers.<br/>
<br/>
My current work around for this lack of functionality is to have the source layer visible and target layer active and then group and ungroup the object. The group will be created on the active layer and will not move its Z position. Unfortunately, this can break constraints between objects.<br/>

<br/>
This file has too many jumper cables.<br/>
<br/>
When using break-Outs on a truss, we often have times when we do not need jumpers to connect to nearby lights. Since break-Outs come with cables, they can connect directly.<br/>
<br/>
in the attached test file, I have drawn a red 10-foot radius circle around the breakout. Since the breakout has 10-foot tails (cables with connectors), all lights within the 10-foot radius circle can be connected directly to the output circuits of the breakout. Therefore, jumper cables are not needed for these lights.<br/>
<br/>
We need a way to connect the break-out without adding the extra cables to lights within either a symbol specified or user defined distance.

The Hoist should take on their symbol class when they are inserted. This already works for trusses and spotlights, now we would like to have this for Hoist as well. And maybe we can combine this in one place. Currently you set it for trusses in the tool, for spotlights in the spotlight document settings.<br/>
<br/>
Automatically created classes like &quot;chain link&quot; should be able to be inserted into your own class structure with prefixed text like it is possible for spotlights.<br/>

<br/>
here is a wish from a customer.<br/>
Customer creates a chain dimension by typing in the values using the floating data bar.<br/>
As long as the mouse pointer is in line with the chain dimension, this workflow is working.<br/>
The moment the mouse is not in line, the value is not correct. I know, this is WAD.<br/>
The wish is to lock the mouse to be in line with the chain dimension.<br/>
See video and testfile.<br/>

<br/>
In the Worksheet Formula Builder, &#39;Config&#39; is not an option in the pull down field menu. &#39;Configuration&#39; is, but that is the &quot;type&quot; of door (Swing, Slide, Etc) while the &#39;Config&#39; field is the detail of the operation (Single swing, double swing, X0X, etc.). Â There are individual fields for the operation of each type of door (&#39;Door&#39;.&#39;SwingOperation&#39;, Â &#39;Door&#39;.&#39;SliderOperation&#39;), but &#39;Config&#39; appears to be the Operation of the currently selected door type. Â &#39;Config&#39; is a very useful function for Door Schedules and should be included in the drop down menu.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
For the bigger picture, while &#39;Door&#39;.&#39;Config&#39; appears to be hidden in the OIP and the individual Operation fields are displayed depending on which type of door is selected. This makes me think that &#39;Config&#39; is hidden in the OIP. This is confirmed by the field having a display name of &quot;__NNA_DO_NOT_CHANGE&quot; (as shown by my handy dandy script that makes a worksheet showing all of the PIO Record fields).<br/>
<br/>
There needs to be an additional way to mark PIO fields that will let them be hidden from showing in the OIP, but still allow them to be displayed in worksheets. Even a read only version would be useful to Report information that is contained in the record.<br/>

 * Â classes<br/>
 * component names<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these systems produce a satisfactory result.<br/>
 * Classes are already used extensively to control the visibility and graphical appearance of objects. In BIM workflows, SfB classes are indispensable. Replacing the SfB classes with VMSW codes would cripple the workflow. Appending the VMSW codes to the class is not possible, as there&#39;s no logical mapping. It would also create incorrect SfB class names when exported to IFC.<br/>
 * Names of the components show up in a BIM-workflow. In some cases, the components names need to be selected in an interface. Having the VMSW codes instead of readable names hampers the workflow.<br/>
<br/>
There is more than one solution to this problem, but the most obvious one seems to be âtagging.â Vectorworks already allows tags for resources, classes, layers and more. This is a great workaround to attach non-specified information to objects. Extending tag support to the components of any component based object (walls, slabs, roofs) would provide an elegant solution.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Remark: please also check the NCS plugin (UK market). Maybe there are NCS codes that could benefit from component specific tagging.

However, the list can get quite long, as there are different real-life cases, that occur regularly, but not at the same time in the same project. For instance:<br/>

<br/>
When adding a Story to a Vectorworks file, you can decide which Design layers should be created with it. These Design layers expect a level. This level needs to be unique: you cannot have 2 (3, 4, ...) Design layers using the same level.<br/>
<br/>
*Customer expectation*<br/>
<br/>
However, in reality, customers expects those Design layers almost always to reference the &#39;zero&#39; level of the story. For that, no level is needed - the &#39;zero&#39; of the story suffices. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
 * Basement:<br/>
 * One layer for the strip footing and/or foundation slab.<br/>
 * One layer for the foundation and basement walls (to avoid wall connection conflicts with the slab âwallsâ)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Ground floor:<br/>
 * Floor slabs<br/>
 * Walls<br/>
 * Interior elements<br/>
 * Dropped ceiling<br/>
<br/>
In all of these cases, the Design layers refer to the same level: the âzeroâ of the Story. This is to avoid confusion for the user (based on observations from training sessions).<br/>
<br/>
To accomplish this &lt;no level&gt; setup today, a user has to:<br/>
 * Create a Design layer<br/>
 * Link it to a Story<br/>
 * Select &lt;no level&gt;<br/>
 * Set the offset from the Story to zero<br/>
 * Confirm, and drag the Design layer to the right spot in the layer list<br/>
<br/>
What the user wants to do, is:<br/>
 * Create a Story<br/>
 * Pick the associated Design Layers<br/>
 * They all refer to the base height of the story. By default, they have &lt;no level&gt;<br/>
 * The default offset for the Design Layers is zero.<br/>
 * Only if need be, can the customer select a Design layer specific level, or change the offset.<br/>
<br/>
*Back story*<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a Design layer for the dropped ceiling. It has its own level, set at 260 cm above story level. The user starts drawing in the Design layer, and all ceilings are on the correct height.<br/>
<br/>
But then someone else takes over. Or the project is halted for a few months, and the original user doesn&#39;t remember the project settings exactly anymore. They start modifying the ceilings, decide that the ones in the toilet areas need to be 20 cm lower. They then have to give the ceiling objects an offset of -20 cm.Â <br/>
<br/>
While this makes perfect sense from the outside, in reality it leads to confusion and frustration from the customer (this is feedback from support and training staff). Customers are much more at ease with a Ceiling design layer that:<br/>
 * Has the same zero level as the story<br/>
 * When placing an object on that Design layer, they can see the offset of 260 cm in the OIP (and immediately understand this is the floor-to-ceiling height)<br/>
 * When they want to lower certain parts, they just change the offset in the OIP to 240 cm (or 20 cm lower)<br/>
<br/>
*Alternative solution: allow Design layers to use the same level*<br/>
<br/>
Upon Story creation, allow the Design layers to be linked to the same level type. This will still be an improvement upon the current situation. There will still be a level that has the same &#39;zero&#39; as the story, but at least it will be limited to only one such level (instead of a series of duplicates of that level, all having a different name).

<br/>
There doesn&#39;t currently seem to be an option to filter objects based on FILL STYLE. This seems like it would be a rudimentary criterion that should exist.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I want to select all objects that have a hatch fill (_any_ hatch fill). Not currently possible.<br/>
<br/>
Or I want to select polygons whose Fill Style is set to None. Not possible.<br/>
<br/>
These are basic scenarios.

Going through my project and exploring the new Shaded improvements - I realised that I couldn&#39;t adjust the renderworks background per design layer saved view - there were some visuals I wanted to have a white background and others where I wanted an image background. <br/>
<br/>
We can adjust the rendering style per design layer saved view so it would be good that the next logical step would be to change the renderworks background used per saved view. <br/>
<br/>
Examples attached. <br/>

<br/>
The following VE&#39;s are from an in person meeting in the US between the training team, industry specialists and onboarding specialists.<br/>
<br/>
Exploring an alternate workflow more suited to the temporary (non-installation) nature of concert touring, Theatre and Corporate events customers typified by our existing entertainment product customers.  <br/>
<br/>
These customers often place equipment in a model prior to designing the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
An Event Designer would likely place the Speaker and Video objects within the model first to facilitate showing a client a rendered model or 2d plan. Once this user has &#39;mocked up&#39; the event they can use the existing &quot;Create Devices from Worksheet&quot; command to commence working on the schematic.<br/>
<br/>
We would like customers to be able to create devices from plug in objects already within the file.<br/>
<br/>
This  process would throw up a few challenges.<br/>
<br/>
What if there was a light plot with 200 fixtures? The user would not need to create devices for those but perhaps only the AV elements. <br/>
<br/>
So Some kind of filtering would be required, either by object type but I also wonder if by layer  would be preferable<br/>
<br/>
How would the device builder know which devices to use for their respective schematic devices?<br/>
<br/>
We should discuss this. The existing Screen, Video Wall and projector tools lack consistency with regards to make and model information. Speakers and camera&#39;s are probably more reliable when it comes to make and model. It would  be good if the user could be prompted through this process and effectively &#39;Manually Map&#39; items which are missing make and model info.<br/>
<br/>
One workflow to suggest is that prior to running the newly suggested command (Create from PIO&#39;s or this file or maybe a referenced file). The user could attach the equipment item object to each of the PIO&#39;s they wish to make a schematic device for using the equipment item tool thereby predefining and selecting which devices to create. This does not solve the Make and Model issue as this information will need to be entered manually and it would be good for the equipment item tool to extract this information from the PIO where possible.<br/>
<br/>
There may still be customers who wish to keep their schematics in a separate file from their event design. Could this workflow utilise an external (separate) or Xref file as the source equipment items and command be run that creates schematic devices in their preferred separate schematics file?

<br/>
We would like to add similar functionality that can currently be found with the fence/railing tool to the existing ConnectCAD Cable Path Tool.<br/>
<br/>
A user can create a cable path in exactly the same way but upon completion a style can be assigned to the path.<br/>
<br/>
Examples can include cable tray, conduit.<br/>
<br/>
Other suggestions could be that an inventory of required cable tray and conduit equipment can be created from the path and also anywhere a cable tray or conduit passes through a wall or obstacle then a suitable hole could be cut and removed from the wall/obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
A style could be created for fibre optic cable path. The style could also restrict path movement due to lack of fibre bend when creating the path.<br/>
<br/>
This task does not fall directly within the remit of connectCAD but its improvements could rapidly improve the current MEP workflow requirements for architecture and Entertainment.

Here are some suggestions that come to mind to improve the user experience<br/>
 * At the very minimum, open the dialog directly underneath the &quot;New&quot; button<br/>
 * Or, use a menu with the available templates that opens up when the button is clicked<br/>
 * An even better option would be to have a swap pane &quot;Recent Files&quot; &lt;-&gt; &quot;New Document&quot; that would show previews of template documents.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      There are many cases where a record or field name can easily be generated by string functions such as Concat. One prime example is Title Block Border Revisions data. Each time a revision is added, a new Record format with the same base name and an appended number is created.<br/>
<br/>
So when you have three revisions added to a TBB your have three records.<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-1<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-2<br/>
<br/>
Title Block Revision Data-3<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
It is easy to use a concat function to generate the overall record name, but currently as of VW2023 there is no way to use the generated string as the record name in a formula. Â So if you concatenate the overall name into cell B1, you can not use a formula like<br/>
<br/>
=B1.&#39;Date&#39;<br/>
<br/>
You have to use the full written version of<br/>
<br/>
=&#39;Title Block Revision Data-3&#39;.&#39;Date&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
We would like to have function added that will take a string and cause that string to be used in place of literal text as part of or as a complete function.<br/>
<br/>
This would be something like the Eval function in Vectorscript.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
So a worksheet formula of<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1.&#39;Date&#39;) Â would take the string from B1 and use that as the Record name.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Alternately, Eval could require a string of the complete function, similar to how Vectorscript Criteria can be generated by making a string containing the entire criteria, but won&#39;t work using just a portion.<br/>
<br/>
VarName:=&#39;This Layer Name&#39;;<br/>
<br/>
((L=VarName)) does not work.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
VarName:=&#39;L=&#39;&#39;&#39;ThisLayerName&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;;<br/>
<br/>
((VarName)). does work as a criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39; into B1<br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Date&#39; into B2<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1.B2) would ideally be expanded to &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39;.&#39;Date&#39; and function properly.<br/>
<br/>
It would be acceptable toÂ <br/>
<br/>
Store &#39;Title Block Revision Data-1&#39;.&#39;Date&#39; into B1 and then<br/>
<br/>
=Eval(B1) and have the string evaluated as a function.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
This may require a better way to &quot;escape&quot; the single quote marks required for the strings.

<br/>
&quot;Spacemouse. Perspective projection does work slightly better than ortho, but flat views are then almost unusable for accurate work â using Numpad shortcuts to i.e. quickly rotate components in a side view. Fusion 360 has a good halfway house â âPerspective with Ortho Facesâ. This means that any orbit will present as perspective, but selecting a flat view switches to ortho projection for accurate work. Any movement back to a 3D view then switches back to perspective.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So a perspective view where the geometry and objects within the view are orthogonal (Sounds pretty strange to me as a life long Vectorworks user but why not).<br/>

<br/>
When you pick a wall style that is story bound, and you use it in a file that has no (or not the right) story levels, you get this result:<br/>
 * Red alert message in the bottom right.<br/>
 * If active, a beep.<br/>
 * A wall that has no 3D representation in the drawing area.<br/>
<br/>
Novice users very often pick a wall based on what it looks like. As a consequence, they run into the problem above.<br/>
<br/>
Our tech support team spends too much time explaining the system to these users. For prospects, it is even worse: they try to draw BIM with an eval version, pick the wrong wall style for the template, and give up. &quot;Vectorworks is too complicated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This also happens with other objects that have the option to let their 3D height be defined by levels (like slabs, roofs, structural members, ...)<br/>
<br/>
*Solution:*<br/>
<br/>
A wall offers two options to define its height:<br/>
 * Story bound.<br/>
 * Design layer bound.Â <br/>
<br/>
You have to pick either one, or the other.<br/>
<br/>
The problem above could be alleviated by implementing a fall back option.<br/>
 * The user can define both a story bound and a design layer bound settings.<br/>
 * When the object style is used, Vectorworks checks if the conditions are met for the story bound setting:<br/>
 ** Does a story exist?<br/>
 ** If yes, does the level exist?<br/>
 * If yes, then the story bound settings are used.<br/>
 * If no, then the Design layer settings are used.<br/>
<br/>
*Urgency*<br/>
<br/>
For Design Express, this has a medium urgency. Our BIM object styles have to be doubled to cater for templates with, and templates without stories and levels.<br/>
<br/>
Combined with different building classifications in different countries, it creates a list of wall styles that is too long for the customer to be comfortable. It adds to the feeling that &quot;Vectorworks is too complicated.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Unlike most other defaults that can be stored in any file at the correct location in the Defaults folder in the User, Workgroup, or Application folder, it appears that ONLY this one specific file is read and only read when VW launches.<br/>
<br/>
I have not tested the Application folder, but I have not been able to make a file with a different name in the User folder or ANY file in the Workgroup folder work as a storage location for Marionette Commands.<br/>
<br/>
I have also not been able to update the list of Marionette except for creating a new Marionette Menu Command, restarting VW, or editing the workspace.<br/>
<br/>
When Marionette Menu commands are removed from the Marionette Command Library.vwx file, they remain in the menu until one of the methods above to reload the commands is executed.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Please update the Marionette Menu Commands so that they can be stored in any file stored in the correct location in Defaults in Users, Workgroup or Applications and add a way to force VW to &quot;read&quot; the available commands to populate the menu without restarting VW. Adding this functionality to the Refresh Libraries function in the Resource Manger seems like a reasonable way to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
This will make the use of Marionette Menu Commands in larger firms using Workgroup folders much easier.

                                            <td class="description">      Recently prompted by a customerâs technical support/training request, Iâve taken up an issue regarding the graphic representation of the sill and head conditions at window insertions with splayed wall profiles. In top/plan view, there are lines that would seem to indicate the face of walls at the head above and sill below (such as at a cased opening). These are classed by default as Ceiling-Main (so, head condition), but with that class off, one can get similar lines by going into the OIP with the Window In Wall selected, and under Visualization, check &quot;Draw wall lines.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But this is the issue: In either case, when the wall-closure-at-inserts profile is set to splay or round, these lines break, such that a gap appears adjacent to the length of the splayed or rounded profile. However, while I initially assumed this could be a bug belonging to the wall-closure-at-inserts feature, I now suspect this could be an enhancement because the lines in question belong to the 2D components of the plug-in object. In fact, I can &quot;solve&quot; the matter by editing the 2D components of the plug-in object and extend the lines to close the gaps. <br/>
<br/>
The caveat, of course, is that by editing the plug-in object, it is converted &quot;to a user-provided component that will no longer be updated by the plug-in object&quot; (according to the popup dialog). On a project, I suppose one could edit the plug-in object style to have the changes extend throughout, but that also assumes one would know that wherever a particularly window (for example) was inserted, you would also have the same wall-closure-at-inserts profile settings applied. <br/>
<br/>
In sum, I think the current workflow would be: to maintain active components, don&#39;t edit 2D components to suit graphic preferences until the design is fixed (that is, no more changes are expected). An enhancement would be that the gaps and other similar graphical glitches would be avoided by, at the very least, being able to constrain 2D component wall lines at wall-closure-at-inserts profiles.

It should be the other way around. The wall lines are +always+ needed on top of the 2D representation of the symbol.

<br/>
It would be awesome if Drawing Label auto-positioning could be determined in a more custom way. I always want the Y position to be a certain distance from the bottom of the viewport geometry&#39;s bounding box, so I always have to move and adjust the label from its default placement. The default seems to be around 1/2&quot; below the geometry, but I typically want 5/8&quot; or 3/4&quot; below.<br/>
<br/>
And for the X position, I want the default placement for my labels to align all the way to the lefthand side of the bounding box of the viewport geometry, and for the label&#39;s control point to automatically extend to the righthand side of bounding box. Attaching an example of how my layouts typically look once I&#39;ve adjust the label placement.<br/>
<br/>
One reason why it&#39;s particularly annoying to do this manually is all the extra clicking into and out of Annotations that&#39;s involved, especially when I&#39;m creating about 150 viewports / week.<br/>
<br/>
If these defaults could be user-adjusted so that it gets me a few steps closer automatically, it would really streamline things.

The majority of the Vectorscript Worksheet functions require a handle to the worksheet. There is currently no direct way to get this handle.Â <br/>
<br/>
The best current work around is to pass the name of the worksheet as a parameter to the script, but if the worksheet is renamed this will break the script until the RunScript cell formula is updated.<br/>
<br/>
Please add a WSScript_WSHand function that will return the handle to the worksheet the script it running in.

For example,Â this command is often used to make a new &#39;version&#39; of a file alongside the original.<br/>
<br/>
However, these commands seem to default to whatever location was chosen the last time the command was used, which is often some other unrelated project folder. On more than one occasion, I&#39;ve hastily saved into this erroneous location by accident, which later lead to some confusion.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if the Save As windows were to default to the current drawing location, which would simplify things and remove possibilities for errors.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
That being said, one scenario where this idea is invalid is if you&#39;re in a new/unsaved file... then it makes sense for these commands to use whatever the last location was, as is currently the case.

                                            <td class="description">      Many users find &quot;clutter&quot; from portions of the software they would like to remove from their system, ([VE-102057)Â luckily much of this content exists on the cloud, so storage footprint is limited, unfortunately it still occupies large areas of the resource manger when performing a search.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
My proposal is to implement a filter system in such a manner that users are able to hide entire categories of resources which they wish to &quot;remove&quot; from the resource manager.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
This could potentially be accomplished in part using our existing tag system, though it may require reserved/special tags for this purpose? It would also be helpful to provide tagging at the folder level as this would allow simple exclusion of entire folders.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The main categories I can imagine users filtering are:<br/>
 * Units<br/>
 * Imperial<br/>
 * Metric<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Discipline or Software application<br/>
 * Architect<br/>
 * Landmark<br/>
 * Spotlight<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * Hidden files (things like &quot;zNested&quot; or other files could be hidden with a tags as well.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
To provide a consistent interface, check boxes (rather than the pull down) could also be available for<br/>
 * Resource type<br/>
 * Gradients<br/>
 * Hatches<br/>
 * Images<br/>
 * Line Types<br/>
 * Materials<br/>
 * Record Formats<br/>
 * Renderworks Backgrounds<br/>
 * Renderworks Textures<br/>
 * Roof Styles<br/>
 * Scripts<br/>
 * Sketch Styles<br/>
 * Slab Styles<br/>
 * Symbols/Plug-in Objects<br/>
 * Text Styles<br/>
 * Tiles<br/>
 * Wall Styles<br/>
 * Worksheets<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 * The Resource type filter would allow a user additional flexibility to include multiple resources in a single search.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
 * These filter setting should be persistent across an install for continuity<br/>
 * Check boxes should be positive, meaning that if a box is not checked filtering will not occur.<br/>
 * The check boxes should be exposed (easily accessible) in a bar or similar along top or side to allow easy iteration of a search, rather than hidden inside a button.

<br/>
In Vectorworks 2021 we had the &#39;perimeter&#39; texture mapping option. Since Vectorworks 2022 that option has been retired.<br/>
<br/>
In certain cases that are very typical for set designers and exhibition stand designers it is important to get a correct mapping of textures on surfaces. In Vectorworks 2021 that was a dream. In 2022 it became a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021 they could just choose the texture mapped as perimeter. A 2 seconds action.<br/>
<br/>
Now they have to adopt the texture to each nurbs component of the object using the texture tool. After that they have to adjust the mapping by entering the X-value in a field to position the partial texture. This is a multi-minute trial and error process.

+solutions could be:+<br/>
1. Keep the current functionality and change the interface, so it doesn&#39;t look like you can add 2 serial numbers.<br/>

<br/>
It would be great if there is an option to change / override class and layer visibility of a DLVP reference in a normal viewport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example. I&#39;m currently working on a project where we have the full AV setup in a viewport reference.<br/>
<br/>
The only workaround now is duplicating the viewport reference.<br/>

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Users should be able to convert Multiple Extrudes to Generic Solids. This would make it consist with other 3D object types, plus provide a way to troubleshoot an object when it&#39;s misbehaving.<br/>
<br/>
For example, at the moment I&#39;m trying to export a 3D model to DWG, but the Multiple Extrude objects aren&#39;t behaving properly. I thought it&#39;d be an easy fix to just convert them to Generic Solids before exporting again, but Vectorworks won&#39;t let me.<br/>
<br/>
As a workaround, I did discover that if I convert each Multiple Extrude to a Mesh first, then I could convert each Mesh to Generic Solids. But this workaround would not be obvious to most users.<br/>

Every case I know, users wants to use page Number to identify the page if they have more than one page on a sheet layer. Also at the end, they want to number ist with page 1 of 10. So the Worker on the site know, how many drawings he need to have the complete drawings. So stacking order seems to be a workaround to number the title blocks because there is no feature to identify the page the title block is lying on top of and also there is not total number of pages.<br/>
<br/>
So the design of the feature either way is away from what we think users wants to do with the page number. Users want a representation of the number in the print dialog. Print page 4 of 25 as Example.Â <br/>
<br/>
Beside that I think there is a bug. The Number include pages on other sheet layers. I am not sure if this is also the wanted feature-design. In my opinion, the number should start at 1 on every sheet layer. Do I maybe understand something wrong about this feature?<br/>

<br/>
It would be great to have a default &quot;Vectorworks&quot; classification system for all IFC-Entities. At the moment the user experience is, that Vectorworks doesn&#39;t have a classification system. The reason for this experience is, that you have to set up manually the classification for each element in the Data Manager. And you have to know the rules which field areÂ absolutely necessary and which are optionally.<br/>

As soon as these are removed from the user folder or renamed, the problems are gone.<br/>

It would therefore help the support if there was a way to temporarily prevent Vectorworks access to the user settings when starting the program.<br/>

The support would immediately know where to look.<br/>
In addition, customers could also attempt this themselves outside of support hours.

Currently for a user to place fixtures on the floor and have them be the right way up they have to do so in a 3d view and use Automatic Plane.<br/>
<br/>
This particular user wants to be able to remain in a top plan view and place the floor fixtures. He doesn&#39;t want to have to rotate the fixtures via the OIP (Euler Angles) as &quot;This feels like an unnecessary extra step&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
This user likes the angled option on the truss tool (pre-insertion) and was wondering if a similar button on the mode bar could be added to the Lighting Device tool.<br/>

The record should populate the PIO initially like the Lighting Device and Light Info Record but then be editable by the user.<br/>
<br/>
Another option could be styles?

Cable tools have an option to automatically add a data tag at the beginning point of each cable. When doing so, cables originating from the same distribution device all have the same origination point. Therefore, all the data tags are piled atop each other. The user has two options. One, dragging each data tag to another location one at a time. They then need to perform some form of formatting or distribution and alignment adjustments. 2. Using the align/distribution command. This, however, requires several steps. The first is to move one of the data tags off the pile to an estimated distance that will allow the distribution command to fit all the rest in a line. This falls short as all the data tags are distributed in seemingly random order. The distribution command does not currently have a method of sorting the distributed items.<br/>
Â <br/>
Solutions could include:<br/>
1. An automatic offset for data tags when being placed. For plug-in objects that place a single item at a time and then attach their specified data tag, the plug-in object would need to consider data tag placement.<br/>
The automated offset would need to measure the bounding boxes of the data tags to avoid collisions.<br/>
2. Adding a sorting function to the align/distribution tool would allow the user to choose which data field the sort will be based upon. In the cable tools example, this would likely be the ID field.

Problem is, when I discover a locked object that I want to move out of the way, it takes additional time to figure out where it is. <br/>
<br/>
In order to unlock it, I need to activate the layer. figuring out which layer that is can be daunting; the &quot;locked&quot; OIP means both layer and class designation are dimmed. Like, *really* dimmed.<br/>
<br/>
This may have been discussed before, but IMO if an object is declared &quot;locked&quot; in the OIP, I see and recognize that. but if i want to be able to access it, it would be a major assist if the layer and class text were _not_ dimmed, so i could figure out how to get to the layer/class faster, and be able to unlock it.

Currently if you use Brick&amp;Mortar as Compound Material in Wall Components, there is no way to display any properties of that Material alongside quantities, because in a worksheet quantities are reported of Compound Material whereas properties are reported of Simple Materials.Â <br/>
<br/>
Compound Material properties should be either calculated automatically from a formula based on constituent Simple Materials (ie. cost can be extrapolated from individual Simple Material costs) or entered manually (RF concrete will have strength of its own as tested after setting) or it should be able to show multiple results based on constituent Simple Materials (Manufacturer, Product Source etc)<br/>
<br/>
I was recently interacting with an increasing number of customers using Embodied Carbon Calculator and everyone is confused with how Compound Materials work. Currently they need to enter CM name to obtain quantities AND SM name to get properties. All of them ask why would I use CMs then and can I use just SMs. That is a conversation I&#39;d like to avoid ideally and the reason why VECC is set up in that way, but the solution should be Compound Material Properties, not to stop using Compound Materials.<br/>

However, If I want to reference a view, not a section view, the link is not automatically created. So, I might have a plan own one sheet and an elevation on another. I use a Reference Marker object to say &quot;Hey, go look here!&quot; Then I gets a sad, &#39;cause no link. I can manually create the link, but I have a computer???<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see why this shouldn&#39;t be automatically, but perhaps it is a switch in the OIP. Possibly an option to create a link NOT the link indicated. So, a reference marker that reads drawing A on Sheet 4, might actually like to drawing C on sheet 72. Although I can&#39;t see why.

                                            <td class="description">      The snapping in VW is good, but could be improved to reach the next level. Especially users that worked with other CADs are used to other snap features and are looking for similar functionality in our Smart-Cursor. If the snap in Vectorworks would be improved by the functionality that the users like a lot in other CADs, it would make it easier to switch to Vectorworks. For that we collected several wishes.<br/>
 * *Short key to keep the current angle*. The Shift key doesn&#39;t keep the angles. It jumps to the next possible angle. Especially users that come from AutoCAD are looking for another option to keep and LOCK 0Â°, 90Â° or other angles without the jump. See also the movie here: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-99151<br/>
 * *Easier access to stacked objects.* Not a lot of users know what the little * next to the cursor means, when they hover over stacked objects. Also very little users know that they can press a short key or use the context command to have a very small dialog with a list of the stacked objects where one or more objects can be chosen. This also requires several steps and clicks. This could be much easier if the stacked objects could be highlighted in a way that small dialog with the list isn&#39;t required anymore. E.g. the object in the foreground is highlighted, the cursor indicates stacked objects (bigger than *), the user can press a short key to highlight the next object in the background, and the next, and the next. This should be possible combined with Shift to select several stacked objects (like it is possible in the current list).<br/>
 * *Allow Objects in Containers (PIO, Symbols) to be unsnappable.* This would help when setting the Dimensions. In the case of windows, you only want to snap to the wall hole and not to the window sill. Also the frame isn&#39;t desired in this case. They should be only snappable when editing the Symbol/ PIO Geometry.<br/>
 * The same applies to Marionette. If you want to connect Nodes, only the Input should be snappable. See report for more details: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-99835)<br/>
 * *Jump to next Mastersnap.* Users from AutoCAD like the feature to press a button when they are close to a certain master snap point and the curser will jump to that point.<br/>
 * *Snap to Tiles.* In some situations, it would be great to snap to geometry of Tiles e.g. when you create a specific plan for tiles of a bathroom and you need to put dimensions on the tiles. The possibility to snap to tiles isn&#39;t needed for every Object with Tiles and it could be also a performance issue too. A good solution could be to have a checkbox in the OIP like PDF pages have.<br/>
 * Snap should work on the *Clip Cube Surface*. See report for more details: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-98097<br/>
 * VW should show a message if *Snap to Grid is enabled AND Show Grid is off*. The message should show the consequences and could offer the possibility to enable Show Grid. Especially if the user doesn&#39;t see the grid (Show Grid off), it is a source of errors for inexperienced users. We see that often in support and trainings that users enable Snap to Grid because they aren&#39;t aware of the consequences.<br/>
 * *Snap marker outside the snap zone.* Currently, snap marker often covers the area where the snapping happens. E.g. if two Mastersnaps are close to each other, the snapped one needs to be visible. But it is covered from a marker, that has the purpose to help. _See screenshot in JIRA._<br/>
 * *Double-click suspend snapping shortcut* should be disabled during writing: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VB-189888<br/>
 * *Snap to intersection of 3D objects:* https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-103422<br/>
 * *Snap to selection.* If there are a lot of objects in the drawing, it would be great if there would be an option to limit the snap to the selected objects only.

1. A checkbox that, when checked, inserts the circuit name and circuit number into the appropriate field. When unchecked, the information will not be entered and therefore not overwrite any existing data.<br/>
2. A checkbox or additional setting in the automated numbering tool allows the user to insert or not insert the circuit name and number information.<br/>
3. A limit of some sort that restricts the placing of circuit names and circuit numbers to that of jumper cables.

Currently when replacing an object in your active drawing, the replace function doesn&#39;t give you acces to your full workgroup library.Â <br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The desired object needs to be in your active drawing if you will be able to replace it.<br/>

Example:Â <br/>
<br/>
*Workgroup library - Layher*<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having multiple 2m layher standards that I want to replace for 3m ones. I&#39;m selecting all 2m standards, and hit replace. When going to the workgroup folder, I can&#39;t acces my Layher library. I first have to insert the 3m standard into the active file so I can find him in de resource manager.<br/>

It would be great to have material support for the steel profile tools, f.ex. for the tools &quot;Angle 3D&quot;, &quot;Wide Flange 3D&quot;,...<br/>
<br/>
Probably it would make sense to start a discussion about these steel tools and the structural member. Do we need both or can the new style based Structural Member overtake the complete functionality and shapes of the steel tools?<br/>

<br/>
The problem is that this difference is sometimes very low. Two dimensions should be considered as identical if their displayed value are equal. Otherwise, users do not understand why the &quot;â&quot; is displayed instead of the value.<br/>
<br/>
In this example the have a Railing object with 4 posts.<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_1.png!<br/>
<br/>
We can see that the posts Height is &quot;â&quot;. But when we disable the summarize option :<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_02.png!<br/>
<br/>
Looking at this, all users will think that all posts have the same height and so won&#39;t understand why the summarize option is not working.<br/>
<br/>
If we switch to millimeter units and ask for more precision in the worksheet, the we can see that one post is 20 micrometers longer than the others:<br/>
<br/>
!RF_WS_03.png!<br/>
<br/>
They all have the same height, but because the user has put a very slight difference between &quot;Height Pt 1 and &quot;Height Pt 2&quot;, one post is *20 micrometer* longer than the others. This is far below the precision of the unit settings.<br/>
<br/>
*With this logic, the user should produce a quote for the railing with 3 posts + one 20 micrometer longer? Of course not.*<br/>
<br/>
So either the Worksheet should use units settings *to apply precision of the summarize comparison of values*, or at least, give to the user the possibility to choose a precision with the summarize option. In the latter, the default value should be the one matching the unit settings of the document.

As you soon as you select a second Fillet object, the OIP says &quot;2 CSG Solids&quot; and all OIP parameters disappear despite them having common parameters.<br/>
<br/>
We need to be able to select more than one Fillet object and be able to change their radii in the OIP. Currently you have to select and change one at at time which is incredibly cumbersome.<br/>

This same improvement likely also applies to other CSG objects, such as the Thickness parameter for multiple Shell objects.

                                            <td class="description">      This change proposes we abandon the use of the product model number to lookup irrigation performance data. I propose this be accomplished by using one of the existing cells in the data table, or adding a cell that would directly reference a single nozzle performance data set. Using a direct reference, rather than the model would greatly reduce complexity, redundant data, errors and time consuming changes within the performance catalog.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the complexity comes from using the Manufacturers model names to lookup performance data. for example. A manufacturer may offer:<br/>
 # 4 different heights (all different model numbers) X<br/>
 # 2 different materials X<br/>
 # Check valve or not X<br/>
 # Non potable (Purple Cap) X<br/>
 # etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had models with 20+ models and 34 nozzles resulting in 680 model numbers that should only have 34 performance tables (or 68 with pressure regulation) that end up with 5x or more of that number. Each nozzle should have a single performance table - 2 if there is a pressure regulated version.<br/>
<br/>
The Hunter I-20 has 24 models that reference the 2.0 Nozzle performance, 10 of these use an alternate &quot;pressure regulated&quot; chart. These two tables currently have 11 entries in the Outlet Rotor Performance catalog that use a variety of wildcard characters in a effort to reduce redundancy. Each data set contains Â±25 pieces of data that define the nozzle performance - the proposed change would eliminate the redundancy from 255 data points to 50, while also making it much simpler to insure the reference calls the appropriate performance data. Each of the 24 entries would simply receive a reference either the standard &quot;I-20 2.0&quot; or &quot;I-20 2.0PR&quot; data set.<br/>
<br/>
For example the Outlet Rotors catalog could add a column titled &quot;Nozzle Performance Table&quot;to enter these values.

For PIO&#39;s you can map a Vectorworks Record Format with the Data Manager. Every existing and new object has the record format attached.<br/>
For example for ifcDoor this is not possible in the Data Manager. You can do it in the OIP or Marionette (our current way). For all customers which work with Import IFC this would be very helpful and a time saver.<br/>

This is to prevent the breaking of networks when node code is updated between versions either due to new VS functions or fundamental changes to the results of the nodes.<br/>

It would be nice to allow users to have the option to keep this preprocessor on forward movement, maybe a list of the affected nodes (check to see if the code inside has changed between versions?) could be displayed and users can choose which node types to update or leave with old code?

Unfortunately, this is often not possible, because there are several record fields of the Space formatted as Text or Static Text instead of numeric types.<br/>

With VW2023 we replaced Space Labels with Data Tags. Now, the Field Types of the Space Record are even more exhibited as before in Reports, Data Manager or Scripts.<br/>
<br/>
It now becomes very apparent that the Field Types of the Space record formats are a bit of a mess. We should go through it and check where the current Field Types make sense or where they could be changed to numeric values (Area, Coord Disp, Real etc.)<br/>

Often there are duplicated values. One formatted as Text and the other as Number. This should be avoided and only the Number should be provided to the user.<br/>

<br/>
{color:#ff0000}{{Gross Elevation Bottom Bound}}{color} -&gt; defined as _+Text+,_ should be defined as +_Coord Disp_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}{{Gross Elevation Top Bound}}{color}<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Coord Disp_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}Lamps (ct){color} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Real_+<br/>
<br/>
{color:#ff0000}Numbers of occupants{color} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as +_Real_+Â <br/>
<br/>
{{{color:#ff0000}Volume{color}}} -&gt; defined as _+Text+,_ redundant, duplicated value of {{{color:#ff0000}Net Volume Number{color}}}<br/>
<br/>
{{{color:#ff0000}Glazing Area Ratio (%){color}}} -&gt; defined as +_Text_+, should be defined as _+Real (Percentage)+_<br/>
<br/>
There are many more...<br/>
<br/>
In addition some numberic values are just defined as simple +_Real_+ instead of +_Coord Disp_+ (for lengths), _+Area+_, Volume, _+Real (Percentage)+_ etc. If this would be defined, they could be displayed with the correct unit. This would make the current text definded numbersÂ  including a unit redundant.<br/>

<br/>
However, if you want to produce the same PDF, but reduced to 12x18, VW only allows 1 page at a time. Of course we can manually collate individual PDF&#39;s into 1 document, but that&#39;s extra steps.<br/>
<br/>
A workaround is to duplicate sheets A1 -A7 with special names (A1.1...A7.1) and reduce the page size for those special sheets. Then you can use the publish command with only those special sheets to get a single multi-page PDF in 12x18 for example. This too is very much effort.<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to be able to produce a reduced size PDF multi-page document with the Publish command, ON THE FLY.<br/>
- not duplicating and editing sheets for reduced size<br/>
- not having to manually collate individual PDFs<br/>
<br/>
AND, of note, the reduced page size PDFs currently exported by VW are the same file size as the full-size PDFs. We would hope the reduced PDFs would be smaller file size(s)

The customer is aware that they can create their custom tool snapping palette just to select &#39;particular snaps&#39; but...<br/>

What if you could assign all geometry within a particular class to not &#39;Snap&#39; then the cursor would only interact with the geometry required and disregard the other visible geometry.<br/>

in the german version there is a plug-in &quot;change attributes&quot; which could be a gain for the international version.<br/>
<br/>
this plug-in uses a dialog if-then to create links and execute batch commands. For example, it can change attributes of a class as well as entries in a database. these are saved as txt and can be used throughout the company. of course only with the German version.<br/>
<br/>
my use case extends to planning using connectcad as well as light and rigging via braceworks.<br/>
once set up with the use of that plug-in i can easily set standard for drawings across the company and for externals as well.<br/>

<br/>
But it makes it very cumbersome that records from the referenced file are treated differently than records with the same name in the master file. The users are forced to create the same (duplicated) settings for the record in the master file and all referenced files. That are a lot of unnecessary clicks, because the user has two or more sources for the Data Visualization color, which needs two ore more Data Visualization (for every file one).<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if you could consider one or more of the following solutions:<br/>
 * Data Visualisation should treat the records the same if the records have the same name and same fields (References and master document)<br/>
 * Access to more Data Sources within one Data Visualization. This would eliminate the need of setting up two individual Data Visualization.<br/>
 * Save color settings (Display Critera group) as sets

<br/>
I have a Braceworks user in Melbourne who uses 4 different structural engineers. All use an engineering program called â[Space Gass|https://www.spacegass.com/index.htm]â (no one uses SCIA here). He is questioning the value of Braceworks because the export format that includes all the Braceworks intelligence is unable to beÂ [imported into Space Gass|https://www.spacegass.com/manual/Getting_Started/Input_methods.htm]Â as far as we can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The request is that other export formats be developed for the export of the Braceworks structure into civil engineering programs especially this one. This is one of the main selling points of Braceworks after all - saving time so the structural engineers donât have to re-input everything, or is there another way? Does IFC contain Braceworks data like loads?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks Peter.Â

<br/>
At the moment the name of a viewport is very present in Vectorworks (Navigation palette, Organisation dialog, etc.).Â In comparison, for example, the drawing number and the drawing title of a &quot;normal&quot; Viewport are much less important.<br/>
<br/>
For Section Viewports the drawing number is more important because to the section line. <br/>
<br/>
What are the requirements / ideas from my work with current BIM-projects:<br/>
 * The Vectorworks name of viewports should be less important. The drawing title of a viewport should used for all organization jobs. The drawing label for example also use the drawing title and/or the drawing number.<br/>
 * Formula/Auto-Name for the Drawing Title. For example: &quot;SheetName_ScaleVP_Counter&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Attached a file with some scripts which we use to rename viewports for a better organisation of the project.<br/>

The value is already present in the OIP, but it is not available in a worksheet. For Horizontal and Vertical dimensions you can use Width and Height, but if a Dimension Standard the runs past the witness lines is used it will return the entire length. For angles dimension you would have to resort to trigonometry. These formulas are too complicated to be easily done in a worksheet cell.<br/>
<br/>
The attached script takes the Dimension Text and converts it to a number, but gets complicated due to Units and the dash included in Feet &amp; Inches dimensions. This is not a good way to accomplish the task.<br/>
<br/>
Actually it would be good to have a function that returns the actual length of any linear object (lines and probably others) rather than the X/Y values available with Width/Height.<br/>

When the text (given font and size, etc) no longer fits in the container, there is a graphic indicator in the lower right of the container. Clicking that indicator changes the cursor to the insertion cursor and the overflow text can be inserted elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
This seems ideal

The recess fill doesn&#39;t appear to be controlled by any classes, so I can&#39;t make it invisible. I also think there should be a setting to allow a minimum overlap of door leaf within the pocket for a fully extended door. In the file attached, there are two pocket doors that are meant to overlap with the wall even when fully extended. To create that, I had to fudge the location of the pocket recess, meaning I can&#39;t show how it would look when fully open and also the pocket recess is in the incorrect position. I would have to draw over it in my plan or create my own 2D components to show it accurately.

In cases, where certain conditions can mean different initial calculations take different routes, but later on are handled the same, because the results are used as part of a bigger network, you have to *duplicate everything* for every route.<br/>
<br/>
Our wish is for a way to merge such routes to avoid the duplication issue.<br/>

With the data vector of âtool activationâ we are getting a good picture of the usage patterns of the former group, but we have no clue about the latter.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of statistics the two can be easily separated because Marionette Users mainly run the Customized Tools, while Marionette Creators do both (activate the Marionette Tool to create, and also run the Networks/Nodes/Menu Commands).<br/>
<br/>
There are different ways we can go about this. We could <br/>
a)<br/>
simply log the usage of âRun Marionette Scriptâ (context menu, OIP and menu commands).<br/>
<br/>
Or we could do that and go one/two steps further:<br/>
b)<br/>
Similar to how Usage Reporting gives us a view on how often each tool in Vectorworks is used by our customers, it would be beneficial to know which Marionette Nodes are used. Having this information we can investigate the causes and improve access to those Nodes maybe nobody knows about. I often come across ideas of Marionette Creators to make new Nodes, they think donât exist, yet.<br/>
<br/>
and (optionally) c)<br/>
Vectorworks could hash the code of every Marionette network - without In-port values or comments - and send the hashes with the usage report. That would allow us to see how often/wide-spread for example Customization Tools/Nodes/Networks uploaded to the Marionette Gallery are being used.<br/>
<br/>
The sooner those vectors are included, the sooner we have a more complete picture of the Marionette universe.

Currently, picking a tool and then changing the tool&#39;s mode requires a lot of fidgeting and it is actually not very easy to change modes of a tool because modes live in a separate quadrant. Also, changing of the tool itself is made more difficult than needs to be because after invoking the smart options, the user must mouse over to the top left (which is a relatively small hover target) to (re)open the tool palette.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my suggestion is two-fold:<br/>
# remember the last used quadrant<br/>
# Include modes in the tool quadrant (rough mockup is provided)<br/>
<br/>
Remembering the last used quadrant could be restricted to spacebar-use as it would probably get in the way if it always opened fully as soon as the SOD auto-appears.

<br/>
We spend a lot of time preparing template for projects with pre-defined user origins and the last thing we want is for Vectorworks &#39;recommended&#39; settings to intervene.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same goes for the subsequent message asking if we want to do what Vectorworks recommends! Often causes problems when the user fails to read that message and assumes it&#39;s asking if they want to do what they have spent time setting up, only to find out it&#39;s doing what Vectorworks recommends.

<br/>
The calculation is always done with the component thickness defined in the slab settings. But if the component hasn&#39;t aÂ continuous thickness because of a drainage, the calculation for the R-Value needs to be done with the average thickness of the component.<br/>
<br/>
In the attachement you&#39;ll find an example for a simple conic Slab. Of course, if more drains are added on different locations with different heights, the calculation gets more complex.

<br/>
The height in this example should be 2100, for instance, but I have to make it 2090 to allow for the 10 mm shim gap. If the shim gap gets changed, to say 12 mm, we also need to remember to change this setting to 2088. Suffice say this has caused us a few headaches in the past.

It really transforms how one works and interacts with their drawing/model. It&#39;s very useful to go from a single view of, say, a plan, to a multiple view showing the plan, a front elevation and custom or preset 3D view.<br/>
<br/>
However, to actually make this UI and view change complete, currently one must activate one saved view, then turn on MVP, then click activate each individual pane and activate a saved view for each of those panes. This requires many clicks and looking across the UI to complete, unfortunately taking the designer out of their design flow.<br/>
<br/>
For your consideration...<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if Saved Views could remember the multiple view panes state (enabled/disables) as well as (for the enabled state) how many panes are open and what each one&#39;s respective saved view options are. This way, if a saved view was created with MVP on and each pane set to the desired view, the designer could simply activate that saved view to quickly keep working in their design while seeing the already-decided views they need of the design.<br/>
<br/>
There are obvious benefits for using Saved Views for presentation purposes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this.

Currently, our users, when having a long, long worksheet, are unable to clearly place these on Sheet Layers without using multiple viewport tricks.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, user places a long and tall worksheet on a design layer, say 1:1 scale, then create a viewport on a Sheet. create a crop (rectangle), then duplicate the viewport, move to the side, adjust the crop to only showing the header. Then again duplicate that viewport, adjust the crop to the rest of the worksheet, move below the previous viewport and rinse and repeat.Â  (see attachment)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to propose we match or improve what Revit is already doing to their worksheets.<br/>

                                            <td class="description">      In recent day, our marketing efforts seem to be paying off. More interior designers are downloading our software and reaching out for private demos. There is a lot of clarification on how much they can get done in a single software. However, some of these prospects, specially the ones that are already sold on the idea of cool drawings and rendering, ask questions about creating reports, itemizing every aspect of a project. And they pointed out we are falling short in comparison to what Excel provides and what even our competition can do with spreadsheets.Â  <br/>
<br/>
The first and obvious deficiency, is not being able to paste an image into a cell.Â  yes we have the formula =image, but that forces the user to model a detailed object in order to make it show in a report. This is not good enough. A realistic photo would avoid human confusion.Â  The situation I was explained, goes like this: &quot;When a truck full of office furniture and other smaller items is waiting outside the space, the guys do not look for ID numbers on a spreadsheet, they look for a matching photo of the piece and then grab them and bring them in place.Â  Visuals here are very important. <br/>
<br/>
Please see attachment so you can get a better idea of where we want to be if we want to persist on reaching out for these designers. <br/>

If we want to draw with as high efficiency in Vectorworks as in Sketchup when it comes to modeling via push pull, then there will certainly have to be an option to give an extrusion a fill color.<br/>
<br/>
For now, if you model a building with the push-pul tools, a plan in top view is completely obscure because all objects at whatever height they are just run through each other. See figure 1 of a simple model via push pull in 3d. looks good, but if we put it in a 2D it&#39;s totally unreadable. So please fill color possible with extrusions.<br/>

<br/>
Partly in response to this we&#39;ve started modelling cavity barriers. This makes them a more prominent part of the design process and has helped me to put earlier thought into their arrangement. Instead of applying them as 2D objects latter in the process. It also provides the possibility of displaying them in 3D, in a 3D view or even on an elevation, with the outer wall components turned off.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is I&#39;ve only been adding horizontal cavity barriers to the model, using the Slab object. At the moment I&#39;m still relying on 2D for vertical cavity barriers.Â Because there&#39;s no suitable tool that comes to my mind that can conveniently model vertical cavity barriers and insert them into walls. And the Slab object is not particularly ideal for the horizontal barriers either, as it would be useful to be able to insert these into walls also.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d like a tool designed for this purpose.<br/>

<br/>
The device graph displays the load on the first 3 pins of the input connector of each device, for all 3-phase connectors this works very well since pins 1 thru 3 are always the live phases of the connector, but for multi-core (socapex, harting, etc...) connectors this doesn&#39;t work very well since they typically have anything from 4 live pins (circuits) to 8 live pins and wildly different pin orders depending on the wiring standard used.<br/>
<br/>
This means that socapex and harting breakouts/plugboxes do not display their phase or circuit loading in a understandable manor for our users since they all have more live phases/circuits and often have pin layouts where the live pins are not sequential inside the connector,<br/>
<br/>
for example<br/>
 * Harting 6 channel German wiring goes Pin 1 thru 6 = L1 thru 6,<br/>
 * Harting 6 channel Benelux/Netherlands goes Pin1=L1, pin2 = N1, pin3 = L2, etc...<br/>
<br/>
The same issues are common with Socapex connectors. <br/>
 for example<br/>
 * US 208v 6 channel socapex Pin1=L1a, Pin2=L1b, Pin3=L2a, etc...<br/>
 * US 120v 6 channel socapex Pin1=L1, Pin2=N1, Pin3=L2, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Similar issues apply to anything that uses a single or 2 phase connector, except they will display the unused pins or pin loading, potentially confusing the user<br/>
<br/>
Instead of displaying the load on the first 3 pins, it would be better to display the load on allÂ  live pins of the input connector of each distributor object. <br/>
 this would also improve how the electrical load for consumer objects is displayed since they typically use single or 2 phase connectors as it would only display the pins that the consumer applies electrical load on.

While the VECC.vwx file contains the VECC worksheet, it is unsuitable to contain the user guide and presents challenges to the user, who has to click on each of the 14 sheets to access the contents before the user can utilize the worksheet as intended.<br/>
<br/>
Found in both the PDF VECC User Guide and the VECC.vwx file are instructions to open the VECC calculator this way: in Vectorworks, go to *Tools &gt; Reports &gt; Create Report &gt; Preformatted Report &gt; Embodied Carbon Calculator*. The calculator can also be copied from the VECC.vwx file (sheet #12) and pasted into any other Vectorworks file. These instructions are only visible to the user only after the user opens the VECC.vwx file and reads down to sheet #12 or if the user opens the PDF User Guide by searching the specific webpage in the Online Help System. This is unnecessarily complicated and distracting to the user.<br/>
<br/>
The online PDF file for the VECC User Guide has been created with Vectorworks and exported by it. Given the nature of a user guide, Vectorworks is not a suitable DTP (desktop publishing) tool to create user guides. The same user guide exists as UI strings, a wholly unsuitable medium to organize a modern user guide, which is not nor should not be a readme file.<br/>
<br/>
The VECC User Guide contains some inaccuracies that make very difficult for the user to perform certain actions. For instance, under Transport Stage [A4] (sheet #6 in the VECC.vwx file), the sequence of commands, *Material &gt; Material Construction &gt; Product Source* field, is incorrect, compared to the accompanying screenshot of the Edit Material dialog box to the left (see below for context). It should read instead something along the lines of âThe *Product Source* field, found in the *Construction* tab of the *Edit Material* dialog box, should also be populated by following the options detailed below.âÂ <br/>
<br/>
!image-2022-06-29-10-56-02-143.png!<br/>
<br/>
*Recommendations:*Â 1) Modify the VECC.vwx file to _*only*_ contain the VECC worksheet. The VECC user guide instructions should be easily accessible via the online Help as with any other Vectorworks features and the user should not have to follow a separate procedure.Â <br/>
<br/>
2) Simplify the creation and/or customization of the VECC worksheet by guiding the user to either follow the commands (*Tools &gt; Reports &gt; Create Report &gt; Preformatted Report &gt; Embodied Carbon Calculator*) in Vectorworks or copy and paste it from the VECC.vwx file (which would only consist of the VECC worksheet).Â <br/>
<br/>
3) Reorganize the VECC User Guide to resolve inaccuracies such as the one indicated above (see screenshot for context.) This may involve some rewriting to follow standard documentation of features.<br/>
<br/>
4) Recreate the VECC User Guide in a suitable industry standard DTP tool (InDesign, Frame Maker, RoboHelp, etc.) to make the translation into Vectorworks&#39; supported languages more efficient and improve the user&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
5) Remove the VECC User Guide content strings from the batch of extractable strings for localization, since they duplicate efforts and add unnecessary complexity to our localization tasks.

<br/>
if the .obj and the .mtl companion enclose in double quotes the file name it is not recognized by VW and the textures are not imported but the file is correctly imported in CloudCompare<br/>
<br/>
If I remove the double quote (.obj files are text files) from filename it import correctly in VW.<br/>
<br/>
Can VW remove the double quotes if they are present?

<br/>
as posted in the 2023 Beta threadÂ T02271_Shaded_Rendering_Improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The attached screen recording demonstratesÂ an issue I keep encountering with the new Shaded mode reflection capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Default Light&quot; which exists when no other lights are in the scene is awfully distracting when seen as a bright reflection in glass surfaces. It honestly looks like Tinkerbell! This has been an issue when showing models to Production Designers and Directors. The effect is particularly odd because this light moves around with the viewer, unlike other stationary Lights that you add to the scene as objects.<br/>
<br/>
Would there be a way to change the coding so it specifically excludes the Default Light reflection from any textures set to Glass Reflectivity?<br/>
<br/>
I know I can turn off reflections completely under Shaded Options, but this new functionality makes other objects look so much better when navigating a model, such as metals. I really love the advancements in Shaded mode in 2023, I just wish it wasn&#39;t so distracting on glass.

<br/>
The more we encourage customers and prospects to use Vectorworks for their freeform modelling however, and the more people come from using SketchUp, the more we get the request to be able to associate dimensions to such objects. SketchUp does associate dims to its massed &quot;objects&quot; so it is quite noticeable when Vectorworks can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Even without the comparison to SketchUp, it is a reasonable expectation for our customers to have that dims that are placed at a point of a 3D form would remain attached to that 3D form as that form is modified.<br/>
<br/>
Attached is simple movie of associated dims in SketchUp, just to show what SU users are used to. Being able to do the same within Vectorworks would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally of course the associated dims would not only be possible on the design layer but also within the viewport annotation space. I do realize that our dimension lines and values would remain on their working plane when added on a design layer. This would likely be the same desire when they are added in the viewport annotation space, though I suspect it may be a bigger challenge to accomplish this (since there really isn&#39;t a working plane there.) Perhaps a solution is that:<br/>
 * Dims added on the Design Layer would be on the working plane<br/>
 * Dims added in the VP annotation space would be on the Flt to the screen (screen plane) and still associated with the 3D object.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for considering this. I would be happy to help test this when the time comes.

Other companies, like AutoCAD and Graphisoft, allow the visitor to select their preferred language on the top right corner, which is standard.Â <br/>

None of our sister companies with localized web content have a language selector at the bottom of the page.<br/>

*Recommendation:* move the language selector to the top right corner of the webpage. See screenshot below for context.<br/>

<br/>
Often a project folder will contain multiple &#39;Superseded&#39; folders, as well as &#39;VW Backup&#39; folders.<br/>
<br/>
When selecting the source folder for conversion or archiving it would be very useful if we were given a view of the folders to be converted, and be able to tick and untick which folders we want to convert, similar to how, for example, backup software works.Â  See attached screenshot from Crashplan.[!https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_07/1412352928_Screenshot2022-07-13at11_11_30.thumb.png.0a309223e4bf45ac4de766b72a4b9076.png|width=1000!|https://forum.vectorworks.net/uploads/monthly_2022_07/148299539_Screenshot2022-07-13at11_11_30.png.2ed068950b5ffb90a05f2ffb0378dc6d.png]<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
So if a project folder is comprised of two sub-folders, rather than Vectorworks trawlling through both folders, we could select one or the other and avoid the unnecessary waste of time while Vectorworks assesses if the folder contains any Vectorworks files or not.<br/>
<br/>
An option to ignore &#39;VW Backup&#39; or Folders containing the word &#39;Superseded&#39;, or other keyword, would also be essential.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.

If you want to reference multiple resources, at this moment, you need to reference each resource manually one by one. It would be useful if there was a way to reference a whole resource folder or all resources of a specific file at once.

 This alert should be able to be hidden analogous the the alert about a missing Heliodon object. It should also list the offending components:<br/>

 * If they are part of an unstyled object: highlight the object and maybe add the option to navigate to it in the drawing.

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Was wanting to put in a request, which I think we asked about previously. The window tool is really lacking an option to have an opaque glazed panel in it. We specify these in almost every project we do, and there just isn&#39;t a sensible way of achiving it at the moment. A typical arrangement would be to have a window with an upper clear pane and a lower opaque pane. Do you know if there is anything in the pipe line to make this more achievable?<br/>

<br/>
This makes outdoor light shows difficult to render with renderworks especially when lasers or Big lights ar usedÂ <br/>
<br/>
There is a need for some users to be able to render light beams thru at least 150m in Renderworks.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a chance to make it possible ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

We use a workaround with a worksheet script, but that workaround is pretty slow on larger files. So there might be room for improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Users are used to draw in cmÂ or mm, but they want some results in worksheets in meters. The same is true for square and volume units: while most items are counted in cubic meters, some items are often counted in cubic decimeters.<br/>
<br/>
I think we need the option to choose the units in which the worksheet shows it&#39;s results. Check the screenshots.<br/>

in the current beta-Version of Vectorworks 2023 you can double click a device within the power palette and it jumps right to that device in the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if you can have a multiple selection by make use of the Option/shift/alt-key while clicking on a device.<br/>
<br/>
The actual behaviour, that it jumps to the selected device, should remain.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and best Regards<br/>

There wishlist items are:<br/>
 * Demo Tool or some form of phasing capability.<br/>
 * Better BIM interoperability - there BIM deliverables have been rejected because there is no phasing workflow in Vectorworks that doesn&#39;t involve classes. The must adhere to NCS Standards and they don&#39;t accommodate -demo, -existing, and -new classes. There needs to be a different way to control phasing.<br/>
 * Improved Section Viewports - they cannot create good drawings from sections so they are forced to draw over everything in their section viewport. They want more control over graphics.<br/>
 * They want less flexibility and clearer understanding of best practices. There are too many conflicting UI elements to know what to use and how.

The potential issue should be clear:<br/>
1) user has a finished project and wants to use all the mappings as a template for new projects<br/>
2) user opens new empty file and opens the saved XML file.<br/>
--&gt; If the user did not do a selective save of the mappings, the new file will contain mappings of symbol definitions not (yet) contained in the document.<br/>

This can lead to more and more orphaned mappings.<br/>

Now, what can be done about this?<br/>

Since there could be users that do this knowingly and on purpose, there should be a solution that gives the user a choice of how to proceed.<br/>

Here&#39;s the proposal:<br/>
When opening an XML-file in the data manager, Vectorworks checks if there are any orphaned mappings. If there are, then ask the user whether they want to keep them or not.

&quot;I&#39;ve been using your products since the days of MiniCAD and have always preferred it to your competitors because it allows me to approach problems my way instead of how some programmer thinks people should approach design problems (Fusion 360 is a prime example of this). I can&#39;t comment on SolidWorks because it does not run on a Mac... While I love VectorWorks, there are some things it needs to do better (documentation, drawing worm gears, some types of extruding along a path), as well as add some functions.<br/>
<br/>
One set of functions people have been asking for for years relate to *drawing circular arcs tangent to two lines, a circle and a line not tangent to the circle, and 2 circles*. I know that users can write programs for VectorWorks but I&#39;ve never been able to figure out how (poor documentation). Since I don&#39;t know how to program those functions for VectorWorks, I&#39;d be happy to provide the mathematical formula for them as well as the bit more complicated problems of drawing circular arcs tangent to a line and spline, a line and an ellipse, 2 ellipses, and 2 splines.

<br/>
Whenever I want to edit wall peaks, I always hit the minus key which is the keyboard shortcut for the Reshape tool.Â However in 2023 this is no longer applicable due to the changes of T02297.<br/>
<br/>
For other folks who might also hit the minus key, I wonder if they&#39;ll know what to do now that the Reshape tool no longer has the wall peaks functionality in 2023. Users might not be aware of the fact that a new tool exists (unfortunately it seems many folks don&#39;t read &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; documentation).<br/>
<br/>
SoÂ I&#39;m wondering if whenever the Reshape tool is activated +with a Wall selected+, perhapsÂ a message in the utility bar could suggest using the Edit Wall tool.<br/>

It would be extremely handy to ALSO be able to draw these shapes from their center points +while on the first mode+ by holding down the Option key (or the Windows equivalent).<br/>
<br/>
This would reduce the number of clicks necessary to change between modes all the time (not only the physical clicks, but also the mental interruption in a user&#39;s thought process vs the simple muscle memory of a hotkey). It would also bring Vectorworks more in line with other software that uses the same hotkey approach (take for example drawing a Rectangle or Marquee in Photoshop, which I&#39;ve attached a screen recording example of).<br/>
<br/>
The existing mode bar modes can stay exactly as they are, I am only proposing to additionally add the ability to temporarily &quot;boomerang&quot; to center mode.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, as per this post:<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/97038-2500-t02309_interactive_sizing_for_door_and_window_creation_and_editing/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=433515]<br/>
<br/>
the hotkey to draw &quot;from center&quot; should be added to the new third mode of the Door &amp; Window tools in order to draw these objects from center, which I&#39;ve already filed as part ofÂ VE-102527.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, a Vectorworks user should expect to always be able to use the same hotkey modifier to do things &quot;by center&quot; across any tools and scenarios where it would be applicable (please seeÂ VE-103130 which relates to this as well).<br/>

It would be a great feature for worksheet if they cloud support grouping of lines &amp; rows like in excel. This would increase the usability of huge worksheets in Vectorworks.<br/>
Example:<br/>
You create a worksheet for doors in a building. On the line 3 you list all doors from the first floor. In the line 5 all doors for the second floor and so on. With grouping line 3 you could very easy make the doors from the first floor invisible.<br/>

We can set all sorts of defaults for Callouts, but not Class, and this is an important aspect because the Class can be used to determine the Callout&#39;s visual attributes such as pen color &amp; line thickness.<br/>
<br/>
For example, all of the callouts on my drawings have a 6 mil blue pen, and if I don&#39;t remember to make sure they&#39;re on my class called &quot;2D-Annotations&quot; then they don&#39;t look correct.<br/>
<br/>
Which means every time I insert a callout I need to change its class, or make sure I have the correct Active Class prior to inserting callouts. This slows down the process of annotating.<br/>

<br/>
This works great but doesn&#39;t allow any snapping reference, so objects will end up getting placed at random distances relative to other objects. Architects will generally want their Windows/Doors to be at nice, even distances from other objects so they&#39;ll probably have to go in after-the-fact and fine-tune the placement to match their desired grid.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, the Wall surface would recognize the active snap grid and limit the X/Y placement to those intervals. This works fine in Top/Plan view but not in 3D views.<br/>
<br/>
The attached movie and test file (with a 6&quot; snap grid active) show an example. Note that if I draw an object in Top/Plan it adheres to the snap grid, but it ignores the snap grid in 3D.

When going through the update process, this would then allow users to select multiple viewports more logically, grouped by sheets, within the viewports tab. Does this make senseÂ [@jloy|https://vectorworks.slack.com/team/U0CKDESNB]Â Â  ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the image attached, see how the top viewport in the list is named 1/1002. It would be much more useful if it was named 1002/1. It would then follow that other viewports assigned to that 1002 sheet would be named 1002/2, 1002/3 etc.Â  As it is, the current implementation means that finding 1/1002, 2/1002, 3/1003, and 1/1003, 2/1003, 3,1003 is much trickier, because they are distributed throughout the list.

He goes back to his custom color palette to edit it. He changes de RVB reference for the color &quot;A&quot;.<br/>

He goes back to the class &quot;1&quot;. The RVB doesn&#39;t match the new color &quot;A&quot; anymore. The RVB in the class matches the previous RVB of the color &quot;A&quot;.<br/>

This is logic since colours aren&#39;t resources.<br/>

It would be great to have a similar (but better off course ;)) functionality in Vectorworks. Importing Point clouds is fun, but the workflow to get technical drawings starting from the pointcloud is usually unclear. This function can help to streamline this workflow.

<br/>
The command Rotate 3D... isn&#39;t very intuitive because it gives no visual feedback to the user.<br/>
 * After pressing OK, the object will be rotated like defined<br/>
 * If the users detects that the values where wrong, they must use cmd+Z and try again with new values...<br/>
 * To get the desired result, this must be repeated several times..<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the Rotate Tool gives visual feedback but the users need to align the current view in 90Â° to the desired rotation axis, which is also an additional and complicated step.<br/>
<br/>
There are already some VEs in Jira about that topic. Example: https://jira.vectorworks.net/browse/VE-94901<br/>
<br/>
If you consider to improve how objects can be rotated in 3D, you could also think about having a slider somewhere for the main axis. See attached movie. Although, the movie is capured on a phone with touch screen, the slider would be a great improvement on a desktop computer as well.

*Recommendations:*<br/>
<br/>
1) Rewrite strings containing poly or polys to reflect whether they indicate polygons or polylines;<br/>
<br/>
2) Whether polys or poly refer to a polygon or polyline, spell it out as such to avoid further confusion;<br/>
<br/>
3) Whenever possible, rename plugin filenames accordingly.<br/>

We can now draw the stairs at an angle in 2D and 3D in VW2022. But we can&#39;t yet move a control point so that the staircase tapers or slopes.<br/>
<br/>
You specify the width of the step, and this then applies to the entire length of the staircase. It would be nice if we could also set this and move it in 2D/3D.

Although it is possible to enter a precise value in the data bar for each push/pull direction, Â in order to make this tool truly interactive, then this extra mode is needed - especially for nonplanar faces where it is impossible to snap a face to an object accurately.

<br/>
[https://vectorworks.my.salesforce.com/a1z2M000007Fbci]<br/>
<br/>
+Wish list:+<br/>
<br/>
(the wish list is discussed during the meeting from 1:04:00 onward)<br/>
 * An ability toÂ create repeatable *Unit plans* please.<br/>
 * In the publish dialog dog, *view the sheets by the sheet stacking order* as seen in the organization dialog.Â <br/>
 * *Consistency* in the software, they UI and between different tools - i.e. there are wall style settings but no roof style settings?<br/>
 * Make data more accessible, easier to use, more consistent throughout the application.Â <br/>
 * All tools that can show dims should be able to have *units independent from the fileâs unit settings*. This would allow users who need to work from one unit system to another to be able to show the needed dim units more easily and without workaround.<br/>
 * A single *stake object that can have an existing and proposed state.*<br/>
 * Direction from Vectorworks on the *best* *way* to do a particular workflow. David recognizes that Vectorworks is flexible and versatile and _can_ get to an end result in many ways, but he wishes that we would state the best practice method for any given workflow.<br/>
 * The ability to *share/export a VWX file including only certain layers*, like one can do when exporting DWGs.<br/>
 * *Snapping and measuring in 3D* as easily and intuitively as SketchUp does it.<br/>
 * When *printing, a setting to make all lines be black and all else remain colour*, or grayscale, etc. Colour fill and black linesâ¦ easily. (CPA is aware of viewport class and layer overrides but this method is onerous.)<br/>
 * A â*drawing set preview*â feature that would show thumbnails of all (or selected) sheet together in a grid.<br/>
 * The ability to *add information to VWX symbols from an external database* (see pain point above for meeting video time where this is discussed.)<br/>
 * Options to easily &amp; quickly *change colours of particular parts of objects or symbols* (i.e exterior panels or the fabric colour of a sofa) in a design to test colour options. Currently they find they must do this using different symbols for the external panels, one symbol per colour option. A system of âsymbol stylesâ may be the kind of thing that would facilitate this.<br/>
 * *Sloped slabs* that allow for a trough and more than 2 drains in a row. Such slabs would allow for drainage off one edge of the slab. (Currently roof faces are being used to simulate this.)<br/>
 * *Spell checking* âon the flyâ<br/>
 * *Gimbal or â3D Draggerâ control* (as seen in subD modelling) for ALL 3D objects.<br/>
 * Smoother/faster symbols selection<br/>
 * *Site and roadway improvements* (These may be address to an extent with the improvements coming in v2023)<br/>
 * Some Landmark features in Architect (This may be substantially addressed with a v2023 task.)<br/>
 * Roof and slab *fascias*<br/>
 * *Gutter and downspouts*<br/>
 * *Real time rendering* right in Vectorworks<br/>
 * Import/Export viewport settings between files (i.e *Viewport Styles*)<br/>
 * Designating / showing structure / making room for *structure within walls*<br/>
 * Films and thin membranes in wall styles (A workaround to show them in wall schedules is currently being but this will not work for energy analysis with Energos.)<br/>
 * Lockable record format fields to stop the changing of data<br/>
 * *Data visualization persistence in section viewports* (i.e fire ratings) without having to update every time something changes<br/>
 * *Auto-update setting for specific viewports* (They would usually use this for Section viewports)<br/>
 * Cabinet improvements<br/>
 * Finishes and worksheet integration and an easier to change finish âkeysâ for multiple spaces.<br/>
 * A *world-based size setting for text* so scaling of viewports that contain text in the design layer (I.e for the detailing previously described) is no longer an issue.<br/>
 * *Deprecate old things*. Give fair warning, for example 2 versions, then remove the old stuff (i.e. patterns). Continuing to add new things without removing enough old things is making Vectorworks look more complicated than it truly is. This is a barrier to learning and becoming successful with Vectorworks.Â <br/>
<br/>
 * Better (smaller) PDF sizes when exporting PDFs<br/>
 * (Roof) Slabs drainage that allows for more than 2 drains in a row, as is commonly built in real life.<br/>
 * Ability to easily connect data in external databases to symbols in Vectorworks, to allow for product specifications to flow from one to the other (without having to use a solution as involved as NBS Chorus).Â

<br/>
When you put dimensions in the annotations of a non-frontal 3D viewport, the dimension value shown is a screen projected interpretation. However this seems logical for us, for the avarage user this is very confusing, so it is an issue which generates quite some support. If you snap to two points in a perspective viewport, the resulting dimension should show the real distance between these points. Off course, for a frontal view, screen projected is still the best option.

<br/>
The 2D views other than &#39;Top&#39; are only used in section viewports.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if a user could choose which 2D view to show on top/plan view. Some users are still working in 2D, also for elevations, interior elevations and sections. They would like to choose a symbol and select which view to use for a particular drawing. If a user selects a 2D view other than the Top view, that symbol instance should no longer be considered hybrid.

Problem: Structural member, always draw undesired lines when in shaded mode. There&#39;s no way to get a clean drawing when rendering in Hidden Line. Please, check the attached Vectorworks File.<br/>
<br/>
Solution: Structural member doesn&#39;t have the button &quot;Merge with structural objects in sections&quot;, adding the button mentioned earlier to the structural part and covering part of the structural member options, will solve all the possible outcomes for this problem. Please, check the attached Image File and the Vectorworks File.<br/>
<br/>
Right now all objects (non-PIO objects) have the option, resulting in a correct a fantastic behavior when touching walls, roofs, slabs, and hardscapes with them seamlessly. The only object falling apart in the workflow is the structural member.  <br/>

Vectorworks allows this scenario:<br/>
 # create a 3D model<br/>
<br/>
 # go to a side view (front, left, right, back)<br/>
<br/>
 # create a viewport on a sheet layer<br/>
<br/>
 # deduct a section viewport from that first viewport<br/>
<br/>
When the 3D model is in top view at an angle, you typically want the projection views to follow that angle.<br/>
 # Creating viewports is perfectly possible. You simply change the work plane, and create a viewport.<br/>
<br/>
 # However, deducting a section viewport from that &#39;rotated model&#39; viewport is no longer possible. Vectorworks informs the user that it should be one of the standard views for this to work.<br/>
<br/>
Please, make it possible to deduct a section viewport from any side view(port) with orthogonal projection (and not only front, left, right, back).

To accomplish this, it must be done using the Custom Selection command and the correct criteria, but this process requires several steps and takes the designer out of their workflow when iterating a design.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if the Select Similar tool could have a preference added to its tool prefs to enable selecting by the same plug-in style.<br/>

 # Breakout record, documenting name, cost, etc....<br/>

<br/>
List browsers often exhibit erratic scrolling behaviors when the user is editing the list contents.<br/>
 This is mostly caused by dialog handlers fully rebuilding the list upon certain user actions.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases it would be possibile to avoid this by handling events in dialogs more precisely.<br/>
 Often this situation is mitigated in VW code by ensuring the selection after the reload is the same as before the reload. In this case the table will scroll so that the edited row is the last visible row. This may be unpleasant for users interacting with the dialog, but it at least ensures that the edited content is visibile.<br/>
<br/>
In other cases it would be easier for the engineer developing the dialog if the list browser had some kind of mechanism to save and restore scroll position of the list.<br/>
I&#39;ve recently something like this for the nav palette to improve scrolling while editing classes.<br/>
<br/>
 What I was thinking about is to add APIs to the SDK list browser to save the list browser scroll position/offset and then restore it when required, while ensuring that the edited item is always visible.

User on the forum claims he specifically needs a line thickness of .025mm as output to a laser for cutting.  When user enters .025mm as a value, it&#39;s rounded up to .03.<br/>
<br/>
From my limited experience with a couple of lasers, only a vector path was needed and line thickness was ignored.  Perhaps higher end lasers allow for varied line thickness?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the forum post:<br/>
<br/>
Hello, if I want the line thickness value set to 0,025mm in VW2022 SP3 (actually: in any version...) it jumps back to 0,03mm.<br/>
<br/>
I need that specific line weight in order to be able to send output to our laser cutting machines. <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on finding the right setting to have more than 2 decimals in line thickness?<br/>
<br/>
Spoiler, it&#39;s not in:<br/>
<br/>
Attributes Palette &gt; Pen &gt; Set Thickness (only rounding to 2 decimals)<br/>
Document Settings &gt; Document Preferences &gt; Dimensions (i can only change thickness for the slash),<br/>
Document Settings &gt; Units (that for dims, not thickness),<br/>
Tools &gt; Options &gt; Preferred Line Thickness (only rouding to 2 decimals)<br/>
Tools &gt; Organization &gt; Classes &gt; Edit &gt; Graphic Attributes &gt; Pen Thickness<br/>
 <br/>

And I do not want to use Illustrator for it (as is our regular workflow for now).<br/>

If you are switching between different data visualizations or repeatedly editing a visualization to get it set up properly, having to hit that small target before every action is difficult and annoying.<br/>

To have a floating or dockable palette showing the current menu options for data visualization would make visualizations more discoverable and easier to use.

The sidebar and tiles do not appear to be landed on the HS.Â  The linework grounds and better defines each.<br/>

See images: &quot;Msg Ctr Pane has outlined tiles&quot;, &quot;Suggested linework for all panes&quot; and compare to the flatness of the &quot;Typical Pane - no outlines&quot;.Â  There is a marked improvement of the clarity and graphics of the panes with the additional linework.<br/>

<br/>
In the worst case, it takes 13 clicks and 2 manual inputs to define a load. In drawings, 30 loads and more are not uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Saved Settings&quot; option is not extensive enough. The possibility to define a label and a symbol is missing here.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, it makes sense that after insert a rigging load, a popup opens to define the load. That saves a lot of time. Here you could have the following options in the Style<br/>
- Defined load ; After inserting there is no popup<br/>
- Custom Load ; After inserting, a popup for the definition of the load is opened<br/>

<br/>
Before T02240 the same point has been used as Anchor Point for the leader line of the Space Label. With VW2023 the Space Label is generated by the Data Tag. This means that this control point has less importance and to the user the reason for the existence of this point isn&#39;t very clear.<br/>
<br/>
To make this more understandable for the user, we should implement it as follows:<br/>
 * We should only show the control point if the Auto-Boundary is set to Auto-Boundary. There is no need for a control point if the Auto-Boundary is set to Manual or Pick-Boundary.<br/>
 * Currently, if the user hovers over the Control Point only &quot;Point&quot; is shown as help text. The text should be changed in &quot;Auto-Boundary origin&quot; (or similar).<br/>
 * We could also add a little icon next to the control point (similar to the Data Tag) that indicates that this point can be used for Auto-Boundary calculation. The icon might be a calculator icon or a wall coverd from a chain.. This can be discussed if we decide to implement this VE.<br/>

The renderings have to be acheived simple and fast (just a few clicks).This is an important point that VW lacks if compared with the competitors. We think with this 3 improvements, VW renderings will gain much higher quality:<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
1.: Render lense (color)<br/>
<br/>
When using render modes, users request that the lens of a lighting fixture is visible/ illuminated in the correct color. The video tutorial how to insert a colored lens to any fixture is very helpful. But that&#39;s quite a lot of work, since you are barely using the same fixtures in every project. So you keep on adding lenses to existing fixtures. Ideally the visible lens comes as a standard and is additionally linked to the on/ off function. So only when the fixture is on, the lens shows up in the correct color.<br/>
<br/>
This functionality is implemented in almost all competitorâs applications â also in Vision.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
2.: render beam at full lens diameter<br/>
<br/>
When using render modes, users request that the beam leaves the lighting fixture at the full diameter of the lens. Due to the way light is emitted from lighting fixtures in VW this always seems wrong in renderings.Â  That makes it impossible to produce high quality lighting renderings for costumers without a third party software.Â <br/>
<br/>
This functionality is implemented in almost all competitorâs applications â also in Vision.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
3.: Improved workflow for barndoors and shutters for better live feedbackÂ <br/>
<br/>
Similar to the 2021 implement improved focus functionality the workflow for barndoors and shutters should follow. Focusing shutters should be possible in a live workflow â similar to the new focus options.Â <br/>
<br/>
Actually rendered shapes of fixture does not fit to the laborious adjusted wire frame beam shape. When changing the focus, it might get even worse.Â <br/>
<br/>
We do need a live focus option (like in VISION) that works equally in wire frame, open GL or a render style. Â <br/>
<br/>
While the rest of the fixture can appear with a nice soft edge, the edges of the shutters stay always sharp. So the shutters should follow the general sharpness settings (beam/ field angle). Â <br/>

<br/>
we got several requests, e.g. PRG, that it&#39;s hardly possible to make a collision control in Spotlight.<br/>
Because Lighting devices are deactivating the indirect lighting.<br/>
Increasing the indirect light doesn&#39;t help here, because the shadowing on the objects itself are needed.<br/>
Making them into a symbol doesn&#39;t help either, because the rotations will be resetted then.<br/>
<br/>
So there is a wish, to have a radiobutton to activate or deactivate the indirect lighting when Lighting devices are inserted.

It would be good to have the Formula Bar also zoom to the same scale as the rest of the worksheet.<br/>
<br/>
I often have the worksheet zoomed in 200% or more to make it easier to read. But the formula bar stays at &quot;100%&quot; zoom and is a substantially smaller font size making it much harder to read and use.<br/>
<br/>
And the formulas are usually the most complicated piece of data in a worksheet. The results are usually fairly simple.<br/>

Making the Formula Bar respond to the Zoom command would make editing formulas much easier.

<br/>
Adjusting the snapping of an LED Wall to hang from the top when inserted/attached to supported truss would allow the user to accurately and efficiently use the LED Wall tool in a ISO view. Not only will this enhancement save the user the time in having to re-adjust the LED Wall, but the change will prevent impeding the user&#39;s work flow when working in 3D.<br/>

 * If a user needs to change the material of multiple structural member objects with different profiles, the user is forced to open the dialog for each structural member object. If the user multi-selects structural member objects, the profiles will be reset to the same profile for every object.<br/>
This workflow is a regression compared to attributes by class, where you can change the class without entering the profile settings.<br/>
 * Object styles would be a great addition for structural members.<br/>
 * It should be possible to punch holes in structural member objects. In real life steel beams often show holes or have modeled cutouts.

<br/>
Our &quot;Positiv-List&quot; of ports is quite big and many ports are not essentially needed to activate the License and working in Vectorworks. Also our proxy-access requires to write password and username in clear-text into a text file, which looks not good in the eyes of a security focussed system advisor.<br/>
<br/>
https://cw-downloads.eu/vectorworks_forum/support-tipps/VW_Positivliste.pdf<br/>
<br/>
https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/articles.html/articles/downloading-activating-and-proxy-servers-r82/<br/>
<br/>
What we think would be a welcome (or first) step to improve that situation is to group that urls and ports in &quot;essentially&quot; &quot;recommended&quot; and &quot;licensing&quot; or communicate more precisely for what kind of event an url would be used.<br/>
<br/>
As example one Customer (Axpo Power AG &gt; an Energy Firm like E.On just much smaller :-) <br/>
<br/>
They are not completely isolated from Internet (Users have Internet) and would make some exceptions for Vectorworks but they are restricted. I am a little scared to advice them to open all ports we have on our list. Also good possible, that activation would not work because of proxy or other security arrangements and because of that Vectorworks would be part of a bigger discussion there which could be resulting in danger of not using Vectorworks anymore.<br/>

You can manually assign a name to the active WP. Once created, a WP name will be displayed in the Working Planes palette.<br/>

In the current version we&#39;re forced to create 3 files to do this.<br/>
<br/>
When importing a dwg file from AutoCAD (where dimensions can have any unit), dimensions often get converted to groups because the dimension unit is different than the drawing unit.<br/>

Having dimension units per dimension object or style both problems could be solved.Â

<br/>
A good comparison is the callout tool:<br/>
 * The texts of dimensions always follow the dimension&#39;s pen color, no matter a text style is u. This is a limitation, because in this means that it is never possible to assign a different color to the text than the dimension&#39;s pen color<br/>
 * For a call out tool the text follows the callout&#39;s pen color when no text style is assigned. When a text style is assigned, the color of that text style will be applied. This gives more graphical flexibility and seems more logical to me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if both tools function with a similar logic, consistency throughout tools will be better.

<br/>
For a multi-component wall:<br/>
 * The whole IFC wall gets the main component&#39;s class as IFC layer (strange, isn&#39;t it?)<br/>
 * The sub-parts get the component&#39;s class as IFC layer (correct)<br/>
<br/>
For a single component wall:<br/>
 * There&#39;s no sub-parts. The IFC wall&#39;s layer is the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class. This means that the class information given to the component is lost in IFC.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally it would behave in the following way:<br/>
<br/>
For a multi-component wall:<br/>
 * The whole IFC wall&#39;s layer should be the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class.<br/>
 * The assignment of layers to components is as desired at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
For a single component wall<br/>
 * It should be the same as for multi- component walls. The whole IFC wall&#39;s layer should be the Vectorworks wall&#39;s class and the (only) sub-part&#39;s layer should be the component&#39;s class. Therefore, the single component walls should be exported as a main object with a sub-part, just like multi-component walls.<br/>

<br/>
If you choose a line type via the attributes palette Vectorworks is going to select a line style by default. Currently it is going this way:<br/>
 * Vectorworks always selects the oldest line style in the active document (the first imported or the first created one)<br/>
 * If the document doesn&#39;t contain any line style, the line style &quot;ISO-02 Dashed&quot; is selected from the Vectorworks library by default.<br/>
<br/>
The issue with this logic:<br/>
<br/>
If you select a line type for he first time in an empty document, the line style &quot;ISO-02 Dashed&quot; is immediately imported. This is a line style you never wanted. And because this is and will ever be the first line style ever imported in this document (unless you delete it manually), it will always be the default line style selected by Vectorworks, even if you are never planning to use this one.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I think Vectorworks should use another logic for the default selection. The resource which was chosen the latest tame by the user, would make a lot more sense.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t only count for Line styles, but as well for hatches, tiles and image fills.

The &quot;Auto Rotate&quot; option of &quot;Image Prop&quot; does not work when viewing vgx files. Is this by design?<br/>

Even though exporting as Web View with the option enabled but the Image Prop isn&#39;t rendered facing the viewer when viewing on a browser.<br/>

This can look strange especially when using the rootball as the trunk is strangely misaligned. The centroid would allow the user to place the center pivot and even the z elevation when needed for a better image prop rotation and placement visually.

This works well - however, when you do so many edits to an object (for example a set of stairs) that it&#39;s better to create a new one, you&#39;ll lose the traceability as you then get a new GUID for the &#39;same&#39; object in the model.<br/>
<br/>
Revit is resolving this by having a tag system and the tags are transferrable from one object to another.Â <br/>
<br/>
It would be fab to have a transferrable tag/ID system for Vectorworks objects as well. Don&#39;t know if this would have to be separate from the GUID (for the GUID to comply with BIM360&#39;s &#39;rules&#39;) or if it could be the same.<br/>

The two options are only available if the Data Tag has a leader.<br/>
<br/>
User wish the fallowing additional options:<br/>
<br/>
*Keep Location of Data Tag*<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the Leader End option above for Data Tags WITHOUT Leader Line. Currently,Â  Data Tags with no Leader Line will ALWAYS move too if the associated object is moved. But it is desirable that also Data Tags with no Leader line will keep the location even the associated object is moved.<br/>
<br/>
*Move if associated object is reshaped*<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the Data Tag will ALWAYS keep the location if the object is reshaped. It is very desirable that some Data Tags can be moved according to the new shape of the objects. E.g. the Data Tag is placed in the center of a Space object. The Space object will be reshaped and the Data Tag location will be updated to the new center of the reshaped Space.

These shim gaps are often different. We need to be able to model these correctly so that things like our window schedules are correct and so that our elevations correctly show the relationships when we&#39;re dimensioning to things.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom shim gap can be effected by the depth of wall and the need to allow for the fall of a sill. The top gap can be effected by different lintel arrangements.Â I&#39;ve not had an example where each side is different (although this can often happen with internal doors), but I can imagine examples where being able to define each side independently would also be required.<br/>

To test,<br/>

<br/>
An error appears saying &quot;No changes to save&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the file is not saved anywhere.Â <br/>
<br/>
Reasons why a user would like to save a file even though no changes have been made:<br/>
 * A good habit of saving a file in the desired location at the very start.<br/>
 * Marking the time and date for the user&#39;s OS. This allows the user to update the time stamp without having made any changes.<br/>
 * Stops the really annoying popup asking if the user would like to save the file or open the settings to the autosave/backup system.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Save-As is the workaround for the first and third bullets. Bullet #2 is solved by allowing Save to happen anytime a user activates Save regardless of the last time a change was made.

Ability to select multiple different objects and scale them based on the individual objects&#39; center point. Currently, when multiple objects are selected and scaled, VW uses the combined center of all objects as the point of reference.<br/>
<br/>
When multiple different symbols are selected there is an option in the Object Info Palette to scale by a factor and the objects stay at their center point. This is desired for any object regardless of type, size, etc. to be able to scale by a factor in the Object Info Palette and keep the objects in place.

Some of our customers asking if it is possible to &quot;Undo&quot; changes that are made in a Vectorworks dialog. Example: You change some values in different tabs in a Vectorworks dialog (e.g. window/door).

Currently this is not possible and you have to cancel the dialog first and re-open it and start changing values.<br/>

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwkNu9amZM]<br/>
<br/>
One question I&#39;d love answered, for instance, is how important the extra RAM in an M1 Ultra is, for Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
More here from Jonathan Reeves on the beta forum:<br/>
{quote}This may be considered a little of topic, but how about the idea of some kind of Vectorworks Benchmarking system for monitoring and comparing performance. It was wonderful to see Rubina appear on the recent Apple Peak Performance Event videos, talking about Vectorworks. Associations like this are invaluable Kudos for Vectorworks in raising awareness, and presence in the AEC market and the fact Vectorworks is the first mainstream Apple Silicon native CAD/BIM software was the reason this happened.<br/>
<br/>
If there was a Vectorworks Benchmark Application (How about VectorBench as a working title) it could aim to become like Cinebench. This always get used in reviewers with new hardware to use these benchmark Applications to compare performance, especially as its cross platform so reviewers can spare Apples with PC&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
This is obviously an amazing way to raise awareness (think free marketing) of the application. It would alos be incredibly helpful for customers to make informed purchasing decisions for hardware and also Vectorworks Upgrades.<br/>

If I could just click and have it applied I would be much happier. A long press or a click on the disclosure triangle would give the pull down options to choose a different marker style.<br/>

The default marker should be settable on a per document basis.

In reality though, projects will often be built with handrails/guardrails stopping just for the landing portion of what would be a single stair object in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
This means that, at present, users wanting to model such stair designs either need to create an stair+railing combination that is close enough and then ungroup it to modify the railing, or they need to use the stair and railing/fence tool to model each separately. While I have been advising users to do the latter, the feedback is this seems like an unnecessarily complicated way to solve something that could simply be solved by adding a setting to the Stair tool (which, in users&#39; opinions, seems more than capable enough to handle adding this one option.)Â <br/>
<br/>
It would be great if, for the Stair&#39;s railing setting, both the handrail and guardrail could have the option to not be shown at landings. In conjunction with this, there would also be settings to extend the lower railing N distance past the top of the lower set of steps and start the upper railing N distance before the upper set of steps, as this is often required by local building codes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!

<br/>
&quot;Attached below is a rough SkUp drawing I did of the NT Olivier recently. A few thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
1. Over the last few years it feels like SkUp have started to encourage organising objects via âOutliner&#39;, rather than Layers (which is now âTagsâ) â¦so any detailed object info is nested in Outliner and Tags are more about saving views/groups. It sort of means that SkUp Outliner is now a bit more like VW Classes, rather than VW Layers. So when I import this SkUP drawing in to VW2021, I currently loose a lot of my SkUP detailed drawing organisation. Because all it imports into VW is the âLayers/Tagsâ.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Customer would like the ability to choose how Sketchup Organisation is translated into Vectorworks, In a similar wat the existing Import DWG Command.<br/>
<br/>
They would also like the ability to assign a prefix to imported Sketchup layers/outliners.<br/>

This has been brought up in conversation also a few times for industry specialists having to do workarounds or change workflow for presentations. <br/>
<br/>
Here is an  example of what currently exists with SketchUp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpNbq10UpFo&amp;t=39s <br/>
<br/>
Attached also is a file with 2 different workflows: <br/>
 - Spotlight 3d legend - This allows you to set the rotation of the text i.e right iso/ left iso <br/>
 as well as screen aligned etc.  If viewed from a back view text is not flipped<br/>
- Data tag<br/>
-Callout tool <br/>
<br/>
Ideally if we could get it to work similarly to SketchUp with the screen aligned element for the leader line as well.  Or incorporate a more automated version of the spotlight screen aligned legends into the data tag and callout tool. <br/>

Many Thanks. <br/>

<br/>
Simply the user needs to be able to access the graphic attributes. Perhaps that mean adding functionality to the Class definition. IO do not think a universal or set of document preferences will do the job.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my example. I have a studio full of sets. The set walls or &#39;flats&#39; are simple extrusions. They have assigned classes that control the look. That might just be a paint color using an Attribute Texture, otherwise the wall would have a white fill.Â <br/>
<br/>
The extrude is likely 3&quot; by some width that will fit in a truck, railroad car or through a loading door by the height. It may have a &#39;reveal&#39; on one or both ends for additional thickness, that part of the flat is likely 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; wide. In plan, I probably want the fill to be black or a hatch with a stroke.Â <br/>
<br/>
If I change the color of the Class fill, the wall might render black. Yes I know I can and should do a Class Override, but I render, A LOT on Design Layers as part of my process and I am certain I&#39;m not alone.<br/>
<br/>
I can and do draw he 2D and 3D as needed, but if I could control the results, the auto hybrid would save time as any design evolves.<br/>
<br/>
I have not begun to use &quot;Materials&quot; as I don&#39;t think the initial iteration suited my needs. I expect the materials function will evolve and will be of use to me. It might even convince some fabricators to embrace VWX. I hope that the auto hybrid can also embrace materials.<br/>

*Background - Current Workflow with Twinmotion:*<br/>
<br/>
We have worked a little on these theme and we arrived to something satisfying as a result, but pretty complicated to put in action.<br/>
 # As much as possible have a precise idea of the exact position of the real camera on your surveyor files. We use a lot the manhole covers to do so. We have precise position. And just have to set the height correctly.<br/>
 # Use Cameramatch to have a rough location , set the aperture manually to match real world camera<br/>
 # As you said use the place RW camera to help precisely setup the camera match position to match more precisely the real world camera. Â We have fiddled a bit to find our camera precise settings on aperture... once done it&#39;s far better. We set the aperture manually.<br/>
 # Export to twin motion with the RW camera visible- -&gt; don&#39;t forget to explode the camera symbol first<br/>
 # Precisely setup your twin motion camera to match your real world camera aperture.<br/>
 # Use the RW camera 3D objects to position your camera and look in the right direction.<br/>
 # Render in twinmotion.<br/>
 # Back to Vectorworks.... et voilÃ <br/>
<br/>
*Wishes:*<br/>
<br/>
Could be far more fast if:<br/>
 # Camera mask and camera shadow objects, or similar objects, could be used in viewports WITHOUT a camera match<br/>
 # *OR* camera match camera position could be MANUALLY ADJUSTED IN the 3D view.<br/>
 # Vectorworks coude allow for images PNG transparency layer to be affected by VW gradients!<br/>
 # Twinmotion link could get cameras positions precisely ( a dream would be to find my Vectorworks saved views available in Twinmotion<br/>
 # Twinmotion could display the camera position in the 3D references.<br/>
 # May I had that I d like to be able to easily use an image as my OpenGL background in VW? I could adjust the openGL aperture of my view to match the camera, position my view fast... and so match my camera position.

Also a possibility to access the object criteria box in Fig7 would make it possible to modify search with style W-* like in worksheets. (EJK-This may be too free/hazardous for general use.)

<br/>
This looks to be WAD? so I am submitting as an enhancement.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
This is from the user.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if I could get assistance on the following issues involving the MEP circuiting tool<br/>
<br/>
The help entry on this tool makes no mention of the fact that the circuiting tool will not work for receptacles that have been inserted into walls. Thus the tool works in reverse to most normal practices. Receptacles inevitably are inserted into some entity be it a wall, floor, ceiling. Â I discovered this after extensive searching on the forum and found an entry from 12 years ago! I guess it has never been fixed. 12 years is a long time for an outstanding bug. The process appears to remain inserting receptacles without attaching to walls circuiting them and then attaching to walls<br/>
<br/>
The actual graphic circuit indicators do not track if an outlet is being moved. Is there a way of having the wire connections associate to the receptacle insertion point or centre of the symbol?

These people have a mix of German and US English Vectorworks and that&#39;s where the problems start. In ConnectCAD some PIO use symbols as part of their draw (very handy because users can customise the symbol). Now when a user takes a file originating on German Vectorworks and opens it on English Vectorworks there&#39;s a symbol in the document called Anschluss but our software is looking for Socket...<br/>
<br/>
This makes Vectorworks less useful for international teams. We could solve this by having universal names and localized names.

                                            <td class="description">      VW comes pretty close but fails to give us the tools to export drawings to DWG using Enterprise CAD standards which are a requirement of federal government projects among others.  This requires us to maintain AutoCAD in order to clean up the DWG files.  Below is the list of items that I believe would fix this allowing us to export each VW sheet to DWG files meeting compliance.<br/>
<br/>
* Export option for strict naming to prevent VW from appending / renaming the DLVP name with &quot;(2D)&quot; when it exports them as separate referenced files.<br/>
(We name the DLVPs how we want the referenced files to be named.)<br/>
<br/>
* Export option to choose a custom name for the layers VW creates in the DWG file that are used for the crop boundary and referenced files.Â <br/>
(The layer naming convention is very specific in Enterprise standards.)<br/>
<br/>
* Export option to choose if you want the references to be relative or absolute. Â <br/>
(VW defaults to making the references absolute which is strictly forbidden. Â They must be relative.)<br/>
<br/>
* VW needs to export text styles to the DWG file as it already does for dimension styles.<br/>
<br/>
* VW needs to give us an export option to rename the None class when it makes it a layer in the DWG file or to move everything on the None class to the 0 layer upon export eliminating the None layer usage. Â <br/>
(&#39;None&#39; is a non-compliant name.)<br/>
<br/>
 feel like all are reasonably attainable options to create in the export DWG dialog and would have a fairly big upside by bringing VW more into the main stream to be usable for projects like these. Â Government projects are a huge A/E sector and they are not the only ones that require Enterprise CAD Standard compliance, or at least some level of compliance that requires one or more of these options. Â That&#39;s a lot of projects out there. Â Just in the US we are talking about billions of dollars of project value.<br/>
<br/>
I would think this kind of flexibility in VW would be good for business. Â We&#39;ve struggled with this for years now but the cost / complexity dynamic is getting notably worse as of late. Â Maintaining AutoCAD simply for these kinds of projects to clean up VW exports on top of having Revit and VW is becoming unsustainable. Â

 <br/>
Every time one exports a sheet layer to a DWG file with the option to export DLVPs as separate referenced files, VW will append the name of those DLVPs (which becomes the file name) with &quot;(2D)&quot;.  Now these files are referenced with the appended file name.  This desperately needs to stop.  Anyone doing federal government work in the US must comply with Enterprise CAD standards which have very strict file naming conventions.  We need to export every sheet with all our drawings, title blocks and backgrounds as separate referenced files with a very specific naming convention.  We accomplish this by naming the DLVP that will be exported appropriately. This would otherwise work fine if VW didn&#39;t append those names.<br/>
 <br/>
Now we have to open all these files and re-reference them in AutoCad after deleting that additional text in the file name.  This is so frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* give us a simple option in the export to DWG dialog for &quot;Strict Naming&quot; that will not allow VW to append these files names.

Perfect is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Company Material (mtexture ID XXX) IP&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where the priority of the name Parts is as follows:<br/>
 # Priority: Ends with &quot;(mtexture ID XXX) IP&quot; (when its a image prop)<br/>
 # Priority: Starts with the Company name &quot;Company (mtexture ID XXX) IP&quot;<br/>
 # Priority: add the Material name in the middle &quot;Company Material (mtexture ID XXX) IP&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right now you find results where the company name is missing, which is not good for those companies. This info is from Philipp Hauzinger CEO of mtextur. And there should never just come the &quot;mtextur ID XXX IP&quot; as a name of an imported IP, RT... At least the beginning of the company name should be in the beginning of the name.

 * The exact same color (i.e. black) can appear twice in the same color grid or list. There should be a way to merge the same colors.<br/>
 * Colors can&#39;t be deleted from the grid. It would be useful to be able to delete a color and get a request to select another color for the existing objects using that color.

<br/>
When making sales calls to potential customers, looking at the usage section for Evaluation Licences there is useful information. In particular the &#39;Days Used&#39; column.<br/>
<br/>
In conversation with [~swood]Â I believe that this only indicates how many times the program has been opened. So for example, a really keen potential customer might be trialling the software everyday for 30 days, but if they have only opened it once then the column would read 1/30. Thus, this isn&#39;t showing the actual usage.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, what would be really informative would be the following:<br/>
 # How long it has been +actively+ used and over how many hours/days.Â <br/>
 # How many times it has been opened and closed.<br/>
 # If it has crashed.<br/>
 # Information on the computer it is installed on. At least the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
I realise some of this might be something similar to what theÂ Tableau Desktop can do except it doesn&#39;t look at EVALS andÂ isn&#39;t updated daily.<br/>
<br/>
If I can see that a potential customer has only opened it once and for 10 minutes over the 30 days I can conclude that it was probably only to open a file. They would still be followed up but not as a priority compared to those whose activity is more strikingly obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any consideration.<br/>

For section viewports, this problem can be easily solved by choosing 1 class for the graphics behind the cut plane. A similar option should exist for regular viewports in hidden line render.

<br/>
Customers who accidentally explore this fill/pen type are usually thinking they are using a hatch and are confused by its behaviour. In the best case, they will contact support so we can advice them to use other fill types. In the worst case, they are just dissatisfied by its functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Patterns do cause a lot of issues while printing to large scale plotters. Plans get cut off after 10cm because of a plotter memory overload.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason patterns are still used is to get &#39;grey&#39; fills in &#39;black and white only&#39; viewing and printing.<br/>
<br/>
If the black and white only would be replaced or completed by a greyscale view, patterns could be sent to the legacy.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I think &quot;patterns&quot; should be hidden by default in the attributes palette. To ensure backwards compatibility and keep the option for users who really want to use it, the user can have the option to enable it under &quot;legacy 2D&quot;, just like &quot;screen plane&quot; options and &quot;unified view&quot; options.

There needs to be a method to correctly report the dimensions in a logical representative way.<br/>
<br/>
As an example I often prepare, not unreasonably, a schedule of space in a worksheet which lists the rooms by number and use, length and width, height, area and volume. At the concept stage this is a clear and convenient way to confirm to clients the sizes without cluttering the concept drawings with dimensions. If the building isn&#39;t aligned to X and Y axes the reported dimension aren&#39;t correct. If the layer view is rotated using the rotate plan tool, the plan can be made to look like it is aligned to x and y but the space length and width are still reported incorrectly.<br/>
<br/>
One approach might be to use the plan rotate angle to &#39;correct&#39; the length and width.<br/>
<br/>
An alternative could be to test for rectilinear spaces, and if true, report their actual side dimensions, not Ymax - Ymin and Xmax - Xmin. Then the reported room dimensions  wouldn&#39;t be affected by alignment to the main axes. If the test is false, then don&#39;t return a dimension. <br/>

Actually the planes palette doesn&#39;t do much but the main thing you want to do here is to make a new named plane.<br/>
<br/>
So I suggest that we add a *New..* option right there in the menu and revert the options.. button to opening the planes menu so you can edit the named planes (or have an *Edit...* button that allows this)<br/>
<br/>
I realise that many people may not use named working planes but nonetheless I think it would be helpful and logical.

I get this pop-up a lot in congested documents when I accidentally click on the wrong thing. It would be nice if there was a way to make this warning appear in the Status Bar instead so that I don&#39;t have to click OK to continue working. If the message needs to be shorter it could simply say &quot;Object doesn&#39;t have all applicable parameters&quot; or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
A case could also be made for the full pop-up appearing once per session, but then being able to suppress future warnings to the Status Bar.<br/>
<br/>
Pop-ups are generally annoying so hopefully we can move away from them in order to speed up workflow.

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
If you use a BCF workflow to manage your issues this is often not good enough. It might be that a combination of objects are affected which cannot be isolated just with classes and layers. You often have too much or to less objects visible if you select an issue in BCF manager. A clip cube can help but customers expect that the objects they see in an issue match exactly the view in Vectorworks.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
A better way to isolate objects (single object visibility) would not only solve the BCF work-flow issue it would also allow to isolate object when modeling in 3D. Currently users create a group and double-click it to isolate the grouped objects.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
The possibility of single object visibility would also catapult Vectorworks in other spheres if it comes to filtering objects. Filtering by name or other attributes would be possible and also dataviz and criteria dialog could benefit from that.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
One of our partner develop a classification plug in and need exactly the possibility to hide and show objects on id level. Classes and Layers are too limited for a bunch of work-flows.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Iâm sure that there are more other areas inside Vectorworks who would benefit from this possibility too.<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Would be nice to get a kind of single object visibility in the near future.

Some customers of us do work like saving in the background (option confirm before save off) every few minutes und testing parts or preparing symbols in new untitled documents. Pretty soon thereâs a message plopping up, that you first have to save this untitled document before it can saved by backup copy. If you work with those untitled documents only a short time for testing or preparing symbols, and you create man of them just when you need them, then this message can be very annoying. So the wish for an option to exclude unsaved documents from backup. Once they are saved, they can be backuped. But only then.

Â <br/>
<br/>
Use cases: One of our partners develops a Vectorworks PlugIn which connects to an online service and attache automatically a classification cost code to an object with some specific information. E.G. If the wall is external and it is Â load bering then automatically the code C.2.2 is attached to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
This third party developer want to be able to create/edit/delete data visualization definitions and be able to make them aktiv or inactive. This would allow to check automatically which objects already got some code, which ones did not and is the attached code correct.<br/>
<br/>
As a distributor we also have similar functionality (E.g. buildUp) and ongoing developments where an automated data visualization would be very useful too. Because of the excellent possibilities of Data Viz we would appreciate to have access to the features using SDK.

In the tool &quot; Setting Section&quot; it is currently not possible to number the chair rows outside of a chair symbol.<br/>
This would be a good option, this is possible with other software manufacturers without problems.<br/>

However, when you need the exception to the rule, I would like a keyboard shortcut that allows selection on all layers â similar to X-Ray mode, but with layers rather than occlusion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when working on a light plot, if I have positions on a separate layer from lights, I could hold down the shortcut to reshape a position without changing layer options.

<br/>
Â <br/>
<br/>
Currently the criteria interface only provides the operators &quot;is&quot; and &quot;is not&quot; for Classes and Layers. We should also have the ability to use the operators &quot;starts with,&quot; &quot;does not start with,&quot; ends with,&quot; &quot;does not end with,&quot; &quot;contains, and &quot;does not contain&quot; to allow for much greater flexibility. Not only would this make it more consistent with Class &amp; Layer Filters which already utilize these operators, but it would make creating the appropriate criteria much faster and more flexible.<br/>
<br/>
One use case is making it easier to isolate collections of Classes/Layers that all have a similar category name (for example I might have Classes such as &quot;SET-Walls,&quot; &quot;SET-Floor,&quot; &quot;SET-Platform,&quot; etc. which could easily be isolated together by setting the criterion to &quot;Class&quot; &quot;contains&quot; &quot;SET&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
This would also allow for additional Classes/Layers to be included in the criteria results as more Classes/Layers are added to the file, instead of having to remember to go back and edit your criteria every time you add a new one.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, while it&#39;s possible to manually type in criteria into worksheets to get around this missing ability in the criteria dialog box, it&#39;s not currently possible to manually type in criteria for Data Visualizations.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding UI, it would be the same as it is for criteria that already support this ability (eg. Name or Symbol).

<br/>
In this perspective mode, all the vertical lines are perpendicular to the bottom of page, this makes the renderings look a lot better.Â <br/>
<br/>
Enscape has this perspective mode, which is very useful. But Vectorwork&#39;s lack of &#39;two point perspective&#39; makes the process of working with Enscape cumbersome.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, to achieve two-point perspective in Enscape, the Vectorworks workflow is as follows:<br/>
- we go to activate our &#39;saved views&#39; in Vectorworks, <br/>
- Sync perspective to Enscape <br/>
- Check that we have the correct view in Enscape<br/>
- Then go back to Vectorworks to &#39;disable&#39; perspective sync (Two Point Perspective in Enscape doesn&#39;t work with perspective sync enabled, and VW does not have Two Point Perspective)<br/>
If Vectorworks has two-point perspective mode, then a lot of steps can be saved.Â

One of the issues is the lack of complete control over rendering textures in the way that Redshift will handle them.<br/>
It would be great if, just like Enscape for Vectorworks, we get a full version of Redshift renderer including ability to create textures and lighting just for redshift.Â <br/>
See enclosed window from a real redshift material editor.Â <br/>
This is critical as our model grows more complex, the link to Enscape, each time we launch it, becomes longer.Â <br/>
Redshift if used properly can significantly reduce that time spent to launch another app (time-cost issue)

Those rules are explained in the [Help Online|ttps://app-help.vectorworks.net/2019/eng/VW2019_Guide/ResourceManager/Searching_for_a_Resource.htm], but it requires from the support team to teach customers how to use them.<br/>
It would be much more appreciated if you don&#39;t have to use a wildcard to get desired results.<br/>
Desired scenario:<br/>
For example, if you type &quot;chair&quot;, you should get both &quot;chairs&quot; and &quot;armchairs&quot;, basically each resource that contains the &quot;chair&quot; word in its resource name. <br/>
Right now, to see &quot;armchairs&quot;, you&#39;d have to type &quot;*chair&quot; and not every client would know that.

<br/>
I found some by just testing at our network, but this is not helpful or professional to just guess.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the Sophos (XG550) Firewall on Version 18.x has a setting for &quot;Web filtering&quot; this worked before and the customer needed to make a special rule for the Site Activation Server where this feature is on setting &quot;none&quot; instead of &quot;Allow All&quot; (see screenshots)<br/>
As they discribed it seems like in the communication there is a switch of the Server answering on your side and at this point a reset was send instead of this switch - probably because the second server was just blocked so the first send the reset.<br/>
After changing the setting described above the activation was just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I also attached a Wireshark file, I think you should be able to get the information needed from there because you know which IPs are relevant to this.<br/>
<br/>
It feels like just making an exception for &quot;site-activation.vectorworks.net&quot; seems not enough, or the reverse dns entries <br/>
[ec2-52-21-238-49.compute-1.amazonaws.com|http://ec2-52-21-238-49.compute-1.amazonaws.com/]&quot; (52.21.238.49)<br/>

...<br/>
<br/>
lead to blocking on some customer firewalls.<br/>
<br/>
I support bigger customers and I&#39;m talking to IT-Admins directly. Still I can&#39;t really tell them what happens there, I just can tell them &quot;Make an exception for site-activation.vectorworks.net&quot; If this doesn&#39;t work they sometimes tracking themselves and add other exceptions or making a much &quot;lower security rule&quot; just for the server running Vectorworks Site Protection.

However, the origin is only a snap point in Top/Plan currently. It needs to be snappable in 3D views as well.<br/>
<br/>
For example if I go to a front view and start drawing the elevation of a piece of furniture in order to start extruding it into a 3D model, being able to snap the bottom of my geometry Â to the origin would be incredibly useful so that the model ends up sitting on the ground without extra steps.<br/>
<br/>
Taking it one step further, in front/back/side views I&#39;d love for the entire line of the ground plane (Z=0) to be snappable. That would make it easier to place things on the ground plane when I drag them up and down on the screen without needing actual ground plane geometry to snap to.

It would be better if we can somehow set it so that editing the contents will begin with everything highlight. By doing this, the user can instantly type the new value and not waste time selecting things. This is a standard in many modern applications. For example, clicking on the URL of any browser will instantly highlight it and you can start typing the new URL right away.

At the moment, if ANY output above the currently selected output is open, the patch will use it. This happens regardless of the type of connector being circuited. The attached screenshot shows a distributor that has three different output connectors. In my case, I want to place four Multi cable circuits into Out.A-D.120V and bypass all the Edison connectors. Having chosen a cable with a multicable connector, I have only these outputs to choose from. The current tool does not read the connector and will allow the connector to patch to an incompatible connector.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if I were to start at Ed.4A, I&#39;d expect the tool to choose Ed.5A as the &quot;next free output.&quot; Whatever my chosen start point is should dictate which output is chosen next.<br/>
<br/>
*Bonus Points*Â towards having the tool stop and pop an error when one runs out of the chosen connector definition. If I choose OutA.120V, it should allow me to keep assigning new connections until it hits a different connector type. In this case, when it changes the Voltage from 120 to 208.

<br/>
When a dialog is close with a simple OK and no change to the settings, the next time that command is invoked it should proceed without a dialog. And we should show an &quot;Oops&quot; button that the user clicks if that wasn&#39;t the expected result. &quot;Oops&quot; undoes the previous command and re-issues the command showing the dialog this time.<br/>

Thus a user right-clicking on a plug-in object to perform some edit has to visually search the menu all the way to the bottom to locate the new item and then move the cursor down to select the item. This introduces an unnecessary hiatus.<br/>
<br/>
It would be useful to have to option for plug-ins to add their context menus at the top of the list right next to the cursor. My 2c worth is that this will be a better guess as to the user&#39;s intentions.<br/>

The problem arise when she was not able to calculate a section on a iMac i9 32Giga ram, and asked me to see how work my MacBook Pro 14&quot; M1Max 64Giga, either using 2022 and 2020.<br/>
The file is the project for the &quot;Torre Piloti&quot; of Genoa harbour by Renzo Piano, and she is working for executive design.<br/>
<br/>
Using 2022<br/>
The file opened fast, and using the clip cube is real time.<br/>
Indeed, creating a Section Viewport VW dismiss the settin window in near 2 seconds the first time and near instantly the subsequent.<br/>
The setting are in the attached windows; the viewport windows show up after rougly 1&#39; 30&quot; in the various timing I made:<br/>
<br/>
VW2022<br/>
sheet layer 72 dpi<br/>
2â to close the window;<br/>
1â 25â to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
sheet layer 300 dpi (made after the previous one) <br/>
windows close almost instantly when pressin OK;<br/>
1â 32&quot; to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using 2020<br/>
I had to test also using 2020 because Lorenza at work on this project has to use 2020:<br/>
<br/>
VW2020<br/>
sheet layer 72 dpi<br/>
10â to close the window;<br/>
3â 15â to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
sheet layer 300 dpi<br/>
10âto close the window;<br/>
4â 40â to show up the section.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And continuing to work on this test file creating more section slow more and more.<br/>
Apparently there are no much use of CPU and memory (seen using Resource Monitor)<br/>
<br/>
I belive that VW2022 native on Apple Chip is no so speedy as one might expect; perhaps is necessary some more optimization.<br/>
Really, Lorenza told me that detailed section are essential for verifying the correct intersection between slab and wall and other components, and she use to do a lot during the design process. One minute and half is too much.<br/>
<br/>
Attached you will find the drawing. Feel free to ask more info either to me or to Lorenza.

Rather than asking each other that (sometimes we work remotely which is even harder), can we have a button to ârequest user to save and commit&#39;<br/>

Is it is way faster to select all the lights first, then number them all in one pass, then to make multiple rounds of selection, each time restarting from where I left off.Â  So this means, 99% of the time, when I open the dialog, I want the Numbering Options&gt;Start value to be 1. No matter what my last numbering session ended with.Â <br/>
<br/>
So, I wish there was a setting I could pick (and save in a saved style) to &quot;Restart Numbering Each time&quot; or something like that. So if that box was checked, every time this dialog was opened, the Start value defaulted to 1.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the numbering works in [~jbenghiat]&#39;s Savvy Select Similar Instrument plugin and, I believe, his Savvy Sequencer plug-in, and it&#39;s much better.

Thus, it is easy to get confused and think you&#39;re editing settings for the checked parameter, but then notice they&#39;re having no affect. This is what happened to me in VB-184543.<br/>
<br/>
As I suggested in comments there, this seems like bad UX.Â What is the use case where a user would actuallyÂ _want_Â to be editing the settings for an unchecked parameter? Isn&#39;t that pointless?<br/>
<br/>
It would seem to be a better user experience if settings were disabled for unchecked params.

Everytime user need going for a while to another area, another software or similar, floating panel disappear.

<br/>
Turning off snapping is not an acceptable solution to this as I still need to snap the light to my aligned tick marks in my hanging position.Â <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told this new feature is &quot;WAD&quot; but I don&#39;t know anyone who agrees with this behavior or finds it helpful. I would direct you towards this discussion here:<br/>
<br/>
[https://forum.vectorworks.net/index.php?/topic/90102-when-i-place-a-light-on-a-hanging-position-why-is-vw-automatically-rotating-the-light/]<br/>
<br/>
If VW thinks this is useful behavior (and I still would like to hear an argument for how this is useful based on the way light plots are actually created) then at the very least, there needs to be a way to toggle it on and off. Either the setting above should apply to both 2D and 3D, or there should be another setting to control 2D behavior. This is a major regression of efficiency and I think that would&#39;ve been made fairly clear in discussions with Spotlight users in the Beta Group before the implementation. Â <br/>
